Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n(3) |\n| 2004 | Portugal U23 | \n3 | \n(2) |\n| 2003– | Portugal | \n205 | \n(128) |\n| Medal record\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Men's football |\n| Representing ![](image) Portugal |\n| UEFA European Championship |\n| **Winner** | 2016 France |  |\n| **Runner-up** | 2004 Portugal |  |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) | 2012 Poland-Ukraine | [note 2] |\n| UEFA Nations League |\n| **Winner** | 2019 Portugal |  |\n| FIFA Confederations Cup |\n| ![Third place](image) | 2017 Russia |  |\n |\n| \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Signature |\n| ![Cristiano Ronaldo signature](image) |\n\n |\n| \n\\*Club domestic league appearances and goals, correct as of 21:00, 11 November 2023 (UTC)‡ National team caps and goals, correct as of 22:40, 19 November 2023 (UTC) |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![A man in a red shirt looks to his right.](image) | This article is part of a series aboutCristiano Ronaldo |\n\n |\n| **Portuguese professional footballer**\n* Career\n* International goals\n* Achievements\n* Rivalry with Lionel Messi\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwhere Madrid were eliminated 3–2 on aggregate.[194] With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar.[195] On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9–1 rout of Granada.[196] His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2–0 win against Rayo Vallecano.[197] Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di Stéfano's club record of 28.[186] He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.[186]\n\n\n\n#### 2015–2017: all-time Madrid top scorer[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n---\n\n\n**Eponyms and public art**\n* Estádio da Madeira\n* Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport\n* Museu CR7\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Films**\n* *The World at His Feet (2014)*\n* *Ronaldo (2015)*\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Family**\n* Kátia Aveiro\n* Georgina Rodríguez\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Related**\n* Galaxy CR7\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Caioli, Luca (2016) [2012]. *Ronaldo: The Obsession for Perfection* (2017 updated ed.).

Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n(3) |\n| 2004 | Portugal U23 | \n3 | \n(2) |\n| 2003– | Portugal | \n205 | \n(128) |\n| Medal record\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Men's football |\n| Representing ![](image) Portugal |\n| UEFA European Championship |\n| **Winner** | 2016 France |  |\n| **Runner-up** | 2004 Portugal |  |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) | 2012 Poland-Ukraine | [note 2] |\n| UEFA Nations League |\n| **Winner** | 2019 Portugal |  |\n| FIFA Confederations Cup |\n| ![Third place](image) | 2017 Russia |  |\n |\n| \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Signature |\n| ![Cristiano Ronaldo signature](image) |\n\n |\n| \n\\*Club domestic league appearances and goals, correct as of 21:00, 11 November 2023 (UTC)‡ National team caps and goals, correct as of 22:40, 19 November 2023 (UTC) |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![A man in a red shirt looks to his right.](image) | This article is part of a series aboutCristiano Ronaldo |\n\n |\n| **Portuguese professional footballer**\n* Career\n* International goals\n* Achievements\n* Rivalry with Lionel Messi\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwhere Madrid were eliminated 3–2 on aggregate.[194] With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar.[195] On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9–1 rout of Granada.[196] His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2–0 win against Rayo Vallecano.[197] Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di Stéfano's club record of 28.[186] He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.[186]\n\n\n\n#### 2015–2017: all-time Madrid top scorer[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n---\n\n\n**Eponyms and public art**\n* Estádio da Madeira\n* Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport\n* Museu CR7\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Films**\n* *The World at His Feet (2014)*\n* *Ronaldo (2015)*\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Family**\n* Kátia Aveiro\n* Georgina Rodríguez\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Related**\n* Galaxy CR7\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Caioli, Luca (2016) [2012]. *Ronaldo: The Obsession for Perfection* (2017 updated ed.).

Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times.

As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[18] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they declined to pay for his treatment.[19][20] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \"the best forward I've ever seen\".[21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lowe, Sid (17 May 2010). \"La Liga Title the Least Barcelona Deserve as Madrid Again Finish Empty Handed\". *The Guardian*.

His game-winning goal in stoppage time was his 500th for Barcelona.[220] His memorable celebration saw him taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing the crowd.[221] On 27 May, Messi scored a goal and set up another for Paco Alcácer in the 2017 Copa del Rey final, helping Barcelona to a 3–1 victory over Alavés, and was named Man of the Match.[222] In total, Messi finished the 2016–17 season with 54 goals, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot Awards for the fourth time in his career.[223]\n\n\n\n#### 2017–18: domestic double and a record fifth Golden Boot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nIFFHS All-time Men's World Dream Team\n |\n| --- |\n| Dream Team | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Goalkeeper | * ![Soviet Union](image) Lev Yashin\n |\n| Defenders | * ![Brazil](image) Cafu\n* ![West Germany](image) Franz Beckenbauer\n* ![Italy](image) Franco Baresi\n* ![Italy](image) Paolo Maldini\n |\n| Midfielders | * ![Spain](image) Xavi\n* ![Argentina](image) Diego Maradona\n* ![Netherlands](image) Johan Cruyff\n |\n| Forwards | * ![Portugal](image) Cristiano Ronaldo\n* ![Brazil](image) Pelé\n* ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi\n |\n\n |\n| B Team | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnder manager Tito Vilanova, who had first coached him aged 14 at *La Masia*, Messi helped the club achieve its best-ever start to a La Liga season during the second half of 2012, amassing 55 points by the competition's midway point, a record in Spanish football.[137] A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi break two longstanding records: he surpassed César Rodríguez's record of 190 league goals, becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga, and Gerd Müller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year, overtaking his 85 goals scored in 1972 for Bayern Munich and West Germany.[138] Messi sent Müller a number 10 Barcelona shirt, signed \"with respect and admiration\", after breaking his 40-year record.[139] At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina.[140] Although FIFA did not acknowledge the achievement, citing verifiability issues, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe shirt was a number 10 replica of the same one Maradona had worn during his stint with the club in 1993.[303] On 17 December, Messi finished third in The Best FIFA Men's Player award behind Robert Lewandowski and Cristiano Ronaldo, and was included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI for the fourteenth consecutive year.[304]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"Congratulations on your historic record, Lionel.

Dortmund were the 34th team he had scored against in the competition, breaking the previous record of 33 held by Cristiano Ronaldo and Raúl.[275] On 2 December, Messi was awarded a record-breaking sixth Ballon d'Or.[276] On 8 December, Messi scored his record-breaking 35th hat-trick in La Liga with three goals in Barcelona's 5–2 home win over Mallorca.[277]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nand Barcelona also paid him $59.6 million as a signing on bonus.[604] His buyout clause was set at $835 million (€700 million).[604] In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Cristiano Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.[605]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history,[91] Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4–0 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.[87] He returned as a false nine during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United. Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2–0, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[92] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of €250 million, while his salary increased to €12 million.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 2009–10: first Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[10] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 15 July 2023, Inter Miami announced the signing of Messi on a two-and-a-half year contract.[370][371] He was formally introduced to fans at a live-streamed event, dubbed \"La PresentaSÍon\", at DRV PNK Stadium the following day alongside fellow signee and former Barcelona teammate Sergio Busquets.[372] His base salary is set at $12 million with guaranteed compensation totaling $20.4 million for the 2023 season; Messi is also set to earn additional shares from jersey sales, MLS Season Pass subscriptions, and a stake in the club itself.[373]\n\n\n\n#### 2023: Leagues Cup victory and eighth Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 9 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the 2017–18 league campaign, against Espanyol in *Derbi barceloní*, thus helping to secure a 5–0 home victory for *Blaugrana* over local rivals.[226] Messi netted twice against Gianluigi Buffon, on 12 September, as Barça defeated the last season's Italian champions Juventus 3–0 at home in the UEFA Champions League.[227] On 19 September, Messi found the net four times in a 6–1 trashing of Eibar at the Camp Nou in La Liga.[228] Three weeks later, on 1 October, Messi surpassed his former teammate Carles Puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club's history, as he helped Barça defeat Las Palmas 3–0 by assisting Sergio Busquets' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played behind closed doors at the Camp Nou due to violence in Catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum.[229]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.[664] It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.[655] Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.[655][665] In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global \"Messi and Friends\" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.[666][667]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n400. **^** \"Argentina into Last Eight of Copa\". *BBC Sport*. 3 July 2007.

Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[54] He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of €7.8 million, becoming the club's highest-paid player.[81][82] Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential.[64][83] Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[75][84]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nhe was voted runner-up for the FIFA Ballon d'Or, relinquishing the award after a four-year monopoly to Cristiano Ronaldo.[159]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 1 June, Galtier confirmed that PSG's home game against Clermont on 3 June would be Messi's last for the club, with the club confirming his departure two days later;[361] the match ended in 3–2 defeat.

his salary increased to €20 million, or €36 million before taxes, the highest wage in the sport.[165] It was reported that Vilanova played a key role in convincing Messi to stay[166] amid strong interest from José Mourinho's Chelsea.[167]\n\n\n\n#### 2014–15: second treble[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Goalkeeper | * ![Italy](image) Gianluigi Buffon\n |\n| Defenders | * ![Brazil](image) Carlos Alberto\n* ![Italy](image) Franco Baresi\n* ![Brazil](image) Roberto Carlos\n |\n| Midfielders | * ![Argentina](image)/![Spain](image) Alfredo Di Stéfano\n* ![Italy](image) Andrea Pirlo\n* ![Netherlands](image) Frank Rijkaard\n* ![France](image) Zinedine Zidane\n |\n| Forwards | * ![Brazil](image) Garrincha\n* ![Netherlands](image) Johan Cruyff\n* ![Brazil](image) Ronaldinho\n |\n\n |\n| Third Team | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Goalkeeper | * ![Germany](image) Manuel Neuer\n |\n| Defenders | * ![Germany](image) Philipp Lahm\n* ![Spain](image) Sergio Ramos\n* ![West Germany](image) Paul Breitner\n |\n| Midfielders | * ![France](image) Michel Platini\n* ![Netherlands](image) Johan Neeskens\n* ![Brazil](image) Didi\n* ![Spain](image) Andrés Iniesta\n |\n| Forwards | * ![Northern Ireland](image) George Best\n* ![Netherlands](image) Marco van Basten\n* ![France](image) Thierry Henry\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the 2004–05 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games throughout the campaign and scoring on six occasions.[37][43] Since his debut the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him.[37] Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.[44][45] Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol at Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Montjuïc, coming on in the 82nd minute.[22] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.[39] As a substitute player, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA All-time XI\n |\n| --- |\n| Goalkeeper | * ![Spain](image) Iker Casillas\n |\n| Defenders | * ![Germany](image) Philipp Lahm\n* ![Spain](image) Carles Puyol\n* ![Spain](image) Gerard Piqué\n* ![Spain](image) Sergio Ramos\n |\n| Midfielders | * ![Spain](image) Andrés Iniesta\n* ![England](image) Steven Gerrard\n* ![Spain](image) Xavi\n |\n| Forwards | * ![Portugal](image) Cristiano Ronaldo\n* ![France](image) Thierry Henry\n* ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBallon d'Or Dream Team\n |\n| --- |\n| First Team | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Goalkeeper | * ![Soviet Union](image) Lev Yashin\n |\n| Defenders | * ![Brazil](image) Cafu\n* ![West Germany](image) Franz Beckenbauer\n* ![Italy](image) Paolo Maldini\n |\n| Midfielders | * ![Argentina](image) Diego Maradona\n* ![Spain](image) Xavi\n* ![Germany](image) Lothar Matthäus\n* ![Brazil](image) Pelé\n |\n| Forwards | * ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi\n* ![Brazil](image) Ronaldo\n* ![Portugal](image) Cristiano Ronaldo\n |\n\n |\n| Second Team | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition\n| Club\n | Season\n | League\n | National cup[a] | Continental[b] | Other\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Division | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals\n |\n| Barcelona C | 2003–04[678] | Tercera División | 10 | 5 | — | — | — | 10 | 5\n |\n| Barcelona B | 2003–04[42] | Segunda División B | 5 | 0 | — | — | — | 5 | 0\n |\n| 2004–05[43] | Segunda División B\n | 17 | 6 | — | — | — | 17 | 6\n |\n| Total\n | 22 | 6 | — | — | — | 22 | 6\n |\n| Barcelona | 2004–05[43] | La Liga | 7 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | — | 9 | 1\n |\n| 2005–06[57] | La Liga\n | 17 | 6 | 2 | 1 | 6 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 25 | 8\n |\n| 2006–07[62] | La Liga\n | 26 | 14 | 2 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 3[c] | 0 | 36 | 17\n |\n| 2007–08[77] | La Liga\n | 28 | 10 | 3 | 0 | 9 | 6 | — | 40 | 16\n |\n| 2008–09[85] | La Liga\n | 31 | 23 | 8 | 6 | 12 | 9 | — | 51 | 38\n |\n| 2009–10[98] | La Liga\n | 35 | 34 | 3 | 1 | 11 | 8 | 4[d] | 4 | 53 | 47\n |\n| 2010–11[113] | La Liga\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nArgentine footballer (born 1987)\n\n\"Messi\" redirects here.

Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7 million and €1.4 million in fines.[676] Facing the judge, he said, \"I just played football.

He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[662] To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[663]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMessi made his MLS debut on 26 August, coming on as a substitute in the 60th minute, scoring a late goal in a 2–0 away win against New York Red Bulls, which put an end to Inter's eleven-match league winless streak.[376] Messi's first goal in the regular season earned him Goal of the Matchday with 89.7% of the vote.[377] On 30 October, following his World Cup win with Argentina and Ligue 1 trophy with PSG, Messi was awarded a record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or.[378] Messi finished his first season for Inter Miami with 11 goals in 14 matches, after playing in his final game in a 1–0 loss to Charlotte FC on 21 October.[379] Miami finished 14th in the Eastern Conference, having gone winless in their last seven games.[380]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n### 2004–2005: success at youth level[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Men's Club Football Awards\n |\n| --- |\n| Best Goalkeeper | * 1997–98: Schmeichel\n* 1998–99: Kahn\n* 1999–2000: Kahn\n* 2000–01: Kahn\n* 2001–02: Kahn\n* 2002–03: Buffon\n* 2003–04: Baía\n* 2004–05: Čech\n* 2005–06: Lehmann\n* 2006–07: Čech\n* 2007–08: Čech\n* 2008–09: Van der Sar\n* 2009–10: Júlio César\n* 2010–16: *Not awarded*\n* 2016–17: Buffon\n* 2017–18: Navas\n* 2018–19: Alisson\n* 2019–20: Neuer\n* 2020–21: Mendy\n |\n| Best Defender | * 1997–98: Hierro\n* 1998–99: Stam\n* 1999–2000: Stam\n* 2000–01: Ayala\n* 2001–02: Roberto Carlos\n* 2002–03: Roberto Carlos\n* 2003–04: Carvalho\n* 2004–05: Terry\n* 2005–06: Puyol\n* 2006–07: Maldini\n* 2007–08: Terry\n* 2008–09: Terry\n* 2009–10: Maicon\n* 2010–16: *Not awarded*\n* 2016–17: Ramos\n* 2017–18: Ramos\n* 2018–19: Van Dijk\n* 2019–20: Kimmich\n* 2020–21: Dias\n |\n| Best Midfielder | * 1997–98: Zidane\n* 1998–99: Beckham\n* 1999–2000: Mendieta\n* 2000–01: Mendieta\n* 2001–02: Ballack\n* 2002–03: Nedvěd\n* 2003–04: Deco\n* 2004–05: Kaká\n* 2005–06: Deco\n* 2006–07: Seedorf\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Includes Copa del Rey, Coupe de France, U.S. Open Cup\n2. **^** Includes UEFA Champions League\n3. **^** One appearance in UEFA Super Cup, two appearances in Supercopa de España\n4. **^** One appearance in UEFA Super Cup, one appearance and two goals in Supercopa de España, two appearances and two goals in FIFA Club World Cup\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** Appearance(s) in Supercopa de España\n6. **^** One appearance and one goal in UEFA Super Cup, two appearances and three goals in Supercopa de España, two appearances and two goals in FIFA Club World Cup\n7. **^** One appearance and two goals in UEFA Super Cup, two appearances and one goal in Supercopa de España, one appearance and one goal in FIFA Club World Cup\n8. **^** Appearance in Trophée des Champions\n9. **^** Appearance(s) in Leagues Cup\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of international goals scored by Lionel Messi\n\n*As of match played 17 November 2023*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player.

Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[92] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of €250 million, while his salary increased to €12 million.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 2009–10: first Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[10] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 15 July 2023, Inter Miami announced the signing of Messi on a two-and-a-half year contract.[370][371] He was formally introduced to fans at a live-streamed event, dubbed \"La PresentaSÍon\", at DRV PNK Stadium the following day alongside fellow signee and former Barcelona teammate Sergio Busquets.[372] His base salary is set at $12 million with guaranteed compensation totaling $20.4 million for the 2023 season; Messi is also set to earn additional shares from jersey sales, MLS Season Pass subscriptions, and a stake in the club itself.[373]\n\n\n\n#### 2023: Leagues Cup victory and eighth Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 9 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the 2017–18 league campaign, against Espanyol in *Derbi barceloní*, thus helping to secure a 5–0 home victory for *Blaugrana* over local rivals.[226] Messi netted twice against Gianluigi Buffon, on 12 September, as Barça defeated the last season's Italian champions Juventus 3–0 at home in the UEFA Champions League.[227] On 19 September, Messi found the net four times in a 6–1 trashing of Eibar at the Camp Nou in La Liga.[228] Three weeks later, on 1 October, Messi surpassed his former teammate Carles Puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club's history, as he helped Barça defeat Las Palmas 3–0 by assisting Sergio Busquets' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played behind closed doors at the Camp Nou due to violence in Catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum.[229]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.[664] It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.[655] Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.[655][665] In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global \"Messi and Friends\" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.[666][667]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n400. **^** \"Argentina into Last Eight of Copa\". *BBC Sport*. 3 July 2007.

Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[54] He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of €7.8 million, becoming the club's highest-paid player.[81][82] Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential.[64][83] Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[75][84]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nhe was voted runner-up for the FIFA Ballon d'Or, relinquishing the award after a four-year monopoly to Cristiano Ronaldo.[159]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 1 June, Galtier confirmed that PSG's home game against Clermont on 3 June would be Messi's last for the club, with the club confirming his departure two days later;[361] the match ended in 3–2 defeat. He ended the season with the highest number of assists in the league with 16 and was also included in the UNFP's Ligue 1 Team of the Season alongside teammates Achraf Hakimi, Nuno Mendes and Mbappé.[362][363]\n\n\n\n### Inter Miami[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Messi with Inter Miami in the 2023 U.S. Open Cup\nFollowing confirmation of his departure from PSG, Messi was linked with a return to former club Barcelona, as well as with a big-money move to Saudi Professional League club Al-Hilal, but his eventual decision to sign for Major League Soccer club Inter Miami was communicated to Barcelona president Joan Laporta by 5 June 2023.[364][365] Barcelona were unable to sign him due to financial constraints.[366]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\ncausing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[164] After prolonged speculation over his future with the club, Messi signed a new contract on 19 May 2014, only a year after his last contractual update; his salary increased to €20 million, or €36 million before taxes, the highest wage in the sport.[165] It was reported that Vilanova played a key role in convincing Messi to stay[166] amid strong interest from José Mourinho's Chelsea.[167]\n\n\n\n#### 2014–15: second treble[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Goalkeeper | * ![Italy](image) Gianluigi Buffon\n |\n| Defenders | * ![Brazil](image) Carlos Alberto\n* ![Italy](image) Franco Baresi\n* ![Brazil](image) Roberto Carlos\n |\n| Midfielders | * ![Argentina](image)/![Spain](image) Alfredo Di Stéfano\n* ![Italy](image) Andrea Pirlo\n* ![Netherlands](image) Frank Rijkaard\n* ![France](image) Zinedine Zidane\n |\n| Forwards | * ![Brazil](image) Garrincha\n* ![Netherlands](image) Johan Cruyff\n* ![Brazil](image) Ronaldinho\n |\n\n |\n| Third Team | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Goalkeeper | * ![Germany](image) Manuel Neuer\n |\n| Defenders | * ![Germany](image) Philipp Lahm\n* ![Spain](image) Sergio Ramos\n* ![West Germany](image) Paul Breitner\n |\n| Midfielders | * ![France](image) Michel Platini\n* ![Netherlands](image) Johan Neeskens\n* ![Brazil](image) Didi\n* ![Spain](image) Andrés Iniesta\n |\n| Forwards | * ![Northern Ireland](image) George Best\n* ![Netherlands](image) Marco van Basten\n* ![France](image) Thierry Henry\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the 2004–05 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games throughout the campaign and scoring on six occasions.[37][43] Since his debut the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him.[37] Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.[44][45] Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol at Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Montjuïc, coming on in the 82nd minute.[22] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.[39] As a substitute player, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA All-time XI\n |\n| --- |\n| Goalkeeper | * ![Spain](image) Iker Casillas\n |\n| Defenders | * ![Germany](image) Philipp Lahm\n* ![Spain](image) Carles Puyol\n* ![Spain](image) Gerard Piqué\n* ![Spain](image) Sergio Ramos\n |\n| Midfielders | * ![Spain](image) Andrés Iniesta\n* ![England](image) Steven Gerrard\n* ![Spain](image) Xavi\n |\n| Forwards | * ![Portugal](image) Cristiano Ronaldo\n* ![France](image) Thierry Henry\n* ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBallon d'Or Dream Team\n |\n| --- |\n| First Team | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Goalkeeper | * ![Soviet Union](image) Lev Yashin\n |\n| Defenders | * ![Brazil](image) Cafu\n* ![West Germany](image) Franz Beckenbauer\n* ![Italy](image) Paolo Maldini\n |\n| Midfielders | * ![Argentina](image) Diego Maradona\n* ![Spain](image) Xavi\n* ![Germany](image) Lothar Matthäus\n* ![Brazil](image) Pelé\n |\n| Forwards | * ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi\n* ![Brazil](image) Ronaldo\n* ![Portugal](image) Cristiano Ronaldo\n |\n\n |\n| Second Team | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition\n| Club\n | Season\n | League\n | National cup[a] | Continental[b] | Other\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Division | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals\n |\n| Barcelona C | 2003–04[678] | Tercera División | 10 | 5 | — | — | — | 10 | 5\n |\n| Barcelona B | 2003–04[42] | Segunda División B | 5 | 0 | — | — | — | 5 | 0\n |\n| 2004–05[43] | Segunda División B\n | 17 | 6 | — | — | — | 17 | 6\n |\n| Total\n | 22 | 6 | — | — | — | 22 | 6\n |\n| Barcelona | 2004–05[43] | La Liga | 7 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | — | 9 | 1\n |\n| 2005–06[57] | La Liga\n | 17 | 6 | 2 | 1 | 6 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 25 | 8\n |\n| 2006–07[62] | La Liga\n | 26 | 14 | 2 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 3[c] | 0 | 36 | 17\n |\n| 2007–08[77] | La Liga\n | 28 | 10 | 3 | 0 | 9 | 6 | — | 40 | 16\n |\n| 2008–09[85] | La Liga\n | 31 | 23 | 8 | 6 | 12 | 9 | — | 51 | 38\n |\n| 2009–10[98] | La Liga\n | 35 | 34 | 3 | 1 | 11 | 8 | 4[d] | 4 | 53 | 47\n |\n| 2010–11[113] | La Liga\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nArgentine footballer (born 1987)\n\n\"Messi\" redirects here.

We do everything that's Catholic, but we don't really have anything traditional except go to the park and have barbecues on Sundays after church.\"[11] Gomez was fluent in Spanish until age seven.[9][*clarification needed*] Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and she remained with her mother.[3][12] Gomez has two younger half-sisters and a younger stepbrother: Gracie Elliot Teefey, through Mandy and her second husband, Brian Teefey,[13][14] and Victoria \"Tori\" and Marcus Gomez, through Ricardo and his second wife, Sara.[15] She earned her high-school diploma through homeschooling in May 2010.[16]\n\n\nGomez was born when her mother was 16 years old.[17] The family had financial troubles throughout Gomez's childhood, her mother struggling to provide for the pair. At one point, Gomez recalls that they had to search for quarters just to get gas for their car. Her mother later recalled that the two would frequently walk to their local dollar store to buy spaghetti for dinner.[18] Gomez has said, \"I was frustrated that my parents weren't together, and never saw the light at the end of the tunnel where my mom was working hard to provide a better life for me. I'm terrified of what I would have become if I'd stayed [in Texas].\"[19] She later added that her mother \"was really strong around me. Having me at 16 had to have been a big responsibility. She gave up everything for me, had three jobs, supported me, sacrificed her life for me.\" Gomez had a close relationship with her grandparents as a child and appeared in various pageants.

Gomez hosted in June the MuchMusic Video Awards in Toronto, Canada, and in November the MTV Europe Music Awards in Belfast, Northern Ireland.[113][114]\n\n\n\n### 2012–2014: *Stars Dance* and

Its productions are rooted in today's pop-EDM default mode [...]\".[146] Andrew Hampp of *Billboard* wrote: \"[...] is a collection of 11 shinily produced pop songs that find Gomez trying on a series of different personalities with her slight-yet-capable vocals [...]\".[147] *Stars Dance* became her first album to debut at number one on the U.S. *Billboard* 200, with first-week sales of 97,000 album-equivalent units.[96] At that time, Gomez, who turned 21, became the youngest solo artist to take first place since *Speak Now* from Taylor Swift in 2010.[96] The album also reached number one in Canada.[92] Gomez incorporated choreographed dance routines into the album's music videos and her promotional live performances, having been inspired by artists such as Janet Jackson and Britney Spears.[148][149] The music video of \"Come & Get It\" won the Best Pop Video at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.[150]\n\n\nIn August 2013, Gomez embarked on her first solo worldwide concert tour, Stars Dance Tour, to further promote *Stars Dance*, with shows in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia.[151] In December 2013, Gomez canceled the Australian and Asian legs of the tour, claiming that she would be taking a hiatus to spend time with her family.[152] In January 2014, it was reported that Gomez had spent two weeks at Dawn at The Meadows, which is a treatment center in Wickenburg, Arizona, that specializes in treating addiction and trauma in young people.[153] Her representative stated that she had spent time there \"voluntarily [...] but not for substance abuse\".[154][155] Gomez confirmed in 2015 that she had been diagnosed with lupus and that after canceling the tour she entered rehab to undergo chemotherapy.[156][157] Gomez played Nina Pennington, an innocent straight-A student, in *Behaving Badly* (2014).[158][159] The project, filmed prior to Gomez's stint in rehab, was released in August to a generally negative critical and commercial reception.[160][161] However, critics deemed Gomez's performance superior to the film.[162][163] Gomez also had a supporting role in the drama *Rudderless* (2014), the directorial debut of William H.

We do everything that's Catholic, but we don't really have anything traditional except go to the park and have barbecues on Sundays after church.\"[11] Gomez was fluent in Spanish until age seven.[9][*clarification needed*] Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and she remained with her mother.[3][12] Gomez has two younger half-sisters and a younger stepbrother: Gracie Elliot Teefey, through Mandy and her second husband, Brian Teefey,[13][14] and Victoria \"Tori\" and Marcus Gomez, through Ricardo and his second wife, Sara.[15] She earned her high-school diploma through homeschooling in May 2010.[16]\n\n\nGomez was born when her mother was 16 years old.[17] The family had financial troubles throughout Gomez's childhood, her mother struggling to provide for the pair. At one point, Gomez recalls that they had to search for quarters just to get gas for their car. Her mother later recalled that the two would frequently walk to their local dollar store to buy spaghetti for dinner.[18] Gomez has said, \"I was frustrated that my parents weren't together, and never saw the light at the end of the tunnel where my mom was working hard to provide a better life for me. I'm terrified of what I would have become if I'd stayed [in Texas].\"[19] She later added that her mother \"was really strong around me. Having me at 16 had to have been a big responsibility. She gave up everything for me, had three jobs, supported me, sacrificed her life for me.\" Gomez had a close relationship with her grandparents as a child and appeared in various pageants. Her grandparents often took care of her while her parents finished their schooling, and she has said they \"raised her\" until she found success in show business.[20]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2002–2006: Career beginnings[edit]\n\n\nGomez first gained an interest in pursuing a career in entertainment watching her mother prepare for stage productions.[21] In 2002, she began her acting career on the children's television series *Barney & Friends*,[22][23] portraying the character Gianna.[24] The show was her first acting gig. Gomez recalled of the experience, \"I was very shy when I was little [...] I didn't know what 'camera right' was. I didn't know what blocking was. I learned everything from *Barney*.\"[25] Gomez appeared in thirteen episodes of the show between 2002 and 2004; the show's producers released her as she was \"too old\" for the series.[25] While working on *Barney & Friends*, Gomez had bit part roles in the film *Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over* (2003) and the made-for-television film *Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire* (2005).[26][27] She guest starred in a 2006 episode of the Disney Channel series *The Suite Life of Zack & Cody*.[28][27]\n\n\n\n### 2007–2012: Breakthrough with Disney and Selena Gomez & the Scene[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gomez at the 2009 Hollywood Style Awards in Beverly Hills\nGomez was given a recurring role on the Disney Channel series *Hannah Montana* in 2007 as pop star Mikayla.[25] During this time, Gomez filmed pilot episodes for two potential Disney Channel series; the first was a *Suite Life* spin-off titled *Arwin!*,[29] and the second was a *Lizzie McGuire* spin-off titled *What's Stevie Thinking?*.[30][31] She later auditioned for a role in the network's series *Wizards of Waverly Place*, ultimately winning the lead role of Alex Russo.[25] Gomez and her mother subsequently moved to Los Angeles.[23] *Wizards of Waverly Place* saw Gomez playing a teenage girl in a family of wizards who own a restaurant in New York City.[32] It quickly became a success for the Disney Channel and represented Gomez's breakthrough into the mainstream.[33] The role brought Gomez \"teen idol\" status.[34][35] And she also became one of the ten highest-paid children's TV stars of all time, earning from US$25,000-30,000 per episode.[36][37] The series received numerous awards and nominations,[38][39] and won the Outstanding Children's Program at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards.[40] It garnered positive reviews,[41][42] with Gomez's being particularly praised for her comic timing and sarcastic delivery.[41][43][44]\n\n\nWhile working on the second season of *Wizards of Waverly Place*, Gomez voiced Helga in the animated film *Horton Hears a Who!* (2008).[45] The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing nearly $300 million worldwide.[46][47] Gomez had a leading role as an aspiring dancer Mary Santiago in *Another Cinderella Story* (2008), the second installment of the *A Cinderella Story* series, released on direct-to-video.[48] She won the Young Artist Award for this role.[49][50] She contributed three songs to the soundtrack, including the single \"Tell Me Something I Don't Know\",[51][52] which was her first ever entry on the U.S. *Billboard* Hot 100 chart.[53] She also recorded the original song \"Fly to Your Heart\" for the soundtrack of the animated film *Tinker Bell* (2008).[54]\n\n\nAt age 16, Gomez signed a record deal with Hollywood Records.[55][56] Gomez formed her own production company in 2008, which she called July Moon Productions.[57] She partnered with XYZ Films for the project, allowing Gomez to option articles, hire writers and create talent packages to shop to studios.[57][58] Gomez was slated to release two films under the company. The first, titled *What Boys Want*, would feature Gomez as a girl who could hear the thoughts of men.[59] She later announced a film adaptation of the novel *Thirteen Reasons Why*, in which she was to play a young girl who commits suicide; ultimately, neither film was made,[60] but Gomez would later executive produce a television adaptation of *Thirteen Reasons Why*.[61]\n\n\nGomez continued to enjoy mainstream success throughout the following year, appearing as Alex Russo in a crossover episode of the Disney Channel series *The Suite Life on Deck* in 2009.[62] She also guest starred as herself on the Disney Channel series *Sonny with a Chance*.[63] Gomez, along with Demi Lovato, starred in the Disney Channel film *Princess Protection Program*, which aired in June 2009.[64] The film had a total of 8.5 million viewers during its premiere.[65] For the film's soundtrack, the pair recorded the song \"One and the Same\", which charted at number eighty-second in the U.S.[53] She next starred in *Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie*, a television film based on the series.[66] The film premiered in August to an audience of 11.4 million viewers, becoming cable's number-one scripted telecast of the year and was the second-most watched TV movie on cable, behind *High School Musical 2.*[67][68][69] Roxana Hadadi of *The Washington Post* credited all three performers—Gomez, David Henrie and Jake T. Austin—for their \"acting skills that carry the film\".[70] The film won the series its second consecutive Emmy for Outstanding Children's Program at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards.[71] Gomez recorded three songs on the television series and film's soundtrack, including the single \"Magic\",[72][73] which reached number sixty-one in the U.S.[53] She then voiced Princess Selenia in the English-language French animated/live-action film *Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard* (2009).[74]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gomez performing at the 2010 KISS FM Jingle Ball\nHoping to cross over into the music industry, Gomez formed the pop rock band Selena Gomez & the Scene through her record deal with Hollywood Records.[75] The name of the band is an \"ironic jab\" at the people who called Gomez a \"wannabe scene\".[76] The band's debut studio album, *Kiss & Tell*, influenced by pop rock and electronic rock was released in September 2009.[77][78] The album received mixed reviews from critics,[78] BBC News described the album as \"[...] fast and full of energy [...]\",[79] and Mikael Wood from *Billboard* wrote: \"[...] her music could use more of her in it\".[77] *Kiss & Tell* debuted at number nine on the U.S. *Billboard* 200, with first-week sales of 66,000 album-equivalent units,[80] and spent a non-consecutive 59 weeks there.[81] Although its lead single was not commercially and critically successful,[53] the second single, \"Naturally\", reached number twenty-nine in the U.S.,[53] and number seven in the U.K..[82] All studio albums and singles of the band were certified gold or higher by the RIAA.[83] In July 2010, Gomez starred alongside Joey King in *Ramona and Beezus*, a film adaptation of the children's novel series by Beverly Cleary, in which she portrayed Beezus Quimby.[84][85] The film was well received by critics;[86] Roger Ebert described it as \"a sweet salute\", and found both actresses \"appealing\".[87] Gomez later reprised the voice role of Princess Selenia in *Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds* (2010).[88] The band's second studio album, *A Year Without Rain*, inspired by dance-pop and synth-pop, was released in September 2010.[89] Basically, the album was not poorly appreciated by critics,[90] many of whom called it the effort was an improvement over 2009's *Kiss & Tell*.[91] The album debuted at number four on the U.S., with first-week sales of over 66,000 album-equivalent units,[89] and also debuted at number six in Canada.[92] Both of the record's singles, \"Round & Round\" and \"A Year Without Rain\", achieved moderate success.[53] The band was awarded Favorite Breakout Artist at the 37th People's Choice Awards.[93]\n\n\nSelena Gomez & the Scene released their third and final, as well as most successful studio album, *When the Sun Goes Down*, in June 2011.[94] The album received mixed reviews from critics,[94] who praised the album's production and described it as \"[...] is a very professional affair\",[95] the album also was co-written by Britney Spears and Katy Perry.[95] It debuted at number four on the U.S. with first-week sales of 78,000 album-equivalent units, reaching number three the following week,[96] as well as reaching number two in Canada and Spain.[97] Its lead single, \"Who Says\", was the band's highest charting effort, peaking at number twenty-one in the U.S.[53] Its second single, \"Love You like a Love Song\", although it did not reach great heights in the charts, reaching only number twenty-two in the U.S. and spending 38 consecutive weeks there,[53] as well as reaching the top-ten in Canada,[98] and topping the chart in Russia,[99] but became a worldwide hit and one of the most successful, best-selling and popular songs in Gomez's career.[100] Alex Frank from Pitchfork called the song \"a cult karaoke classic\".[101] In 2022, *Billboard* ranked the song as the biggest song that peaked at number twenty-two of all time.[102] For two years in a row (2010–2011), *Billboard* magazine ranked Gomez third in their list of 21 Under 21: Music's Hottest Minors, an annual ranking of the most popular musicians under the age of 21.[103][104]\n\n\nGomez starred in the comedy film *Monte Carlo* (2011), with Leighton Meester and Katie Cassidy;[105][106] she played the lead role of Grace, a teenager \"mistaken for a socialite\", Cordelia (also Gomez), \"while on a trip to Paris\".[105][106] In preparation for the role, she learned to play polo and received dialect coaching to speak in two different British accents;[107][108] Gomez's accent was described as \"unconvincing\".[109] The film received mixed reviews from critic.[110] Nick Schager from *Slant Magazine* found Gomez \"cute, but too bland to lend the proceedings any vivid character, except for the few scenes that allow her to indulge her cold, sarcastic, nasty side as Cordelia\".[111] That year, Gomez appeared in a cameo role in the film *The Muppets*.[112] Gomez hosted in June the MuchMusic Video Awards in Toronto, Canada, and in November the MTV Europe Music Awards in Belfast, Northern Ireland.[113][114]\n\n\n\n### 2012–2014: *Stars Dance* and films[edit]\n\n\nGomez confirmed in January 2012 that she would be taking a break from music, placing Selena Gomez & the Scene on hiatus.[115] That year, *Wizards of Waverly Place* officially ended its run on the Disney Channel after four seasons.[116][117] For five years in a row (2009-2013), Gomez won the Kids' Choice Award for Favorite TV Actress.

Its productions are rooted in today's pop-EDM default mode [...]\".[146] Andrew Hampp of *Billboard* wrote: \"[...] is a collection of 11 shinily produced pop songs that find Gomez trying on a series of different personalities with her slight-yet-capable vocals [...]\".[147] *Stars Dance* became her first album to debut at number one on the U.S. *Billboard* 200, with first-week sales of 97,000 album-equivalent units.[96] At that time, Gomez, who turned 21, became the youngest solo artist to take first place since *Speak Now* from Taylor Swift in 2010.[96] The album also reached number one in Canada.[92] Gomez incorporated choreographed dance routines into the album's music videos and her promotional live performances, having been inspired by artists such as Janet Jackson and Britney Spears.[148][149] The music video of \"Come & Get It\" won the Best Pop Video at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.[150]\n\n\nIn August 2013, Gomez embarked on her first solo worldwide concert tour, Stars Dance Tour, to further promote *Stars Dance*, with shows in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia.[151] In December 2013, Gomez canceled the Australian and Asian legs of the tour, claiming that she would be taking a hiatus to spend time with her family.[152] In January 2014, it was reported that Gomez had spent two weeks at Dawn at The Meadows, which is a treatment center in Wickenburg, Arizona, that specializes in treating addiction and trauma in young people.[153] Her representative stated that she had spent time there \"voluntarily [...] but not for substance abuse\".[154][155] Gomez confirmed in 2015 that she had been diagnosed with lupus and that after canceling the tour she entered rehab to undergo chemotherapy.[156][157] Gomez played Nina Pennington, an innocent straight-A student, in *Behaving Badly* (2014).[158][159] The project, filmed prior to Gomez's stint in rehab, was released in August to a generally negative critical and commercial reception.[160][161] However, critics deemed Gomez's performance superior to the film.[162][163] Gomez also had a supporting role in the drama *Rudderless* (2014), the directorial debut of William H.

Gomez addressed the controversy, saying that \"We stayed very true to the book and that's initially what [author] Jay Asher created was a beautifully tragic, complicated yet suspenseful story and I think that's what we wanted to do. We wanted to do it justice and, yeah, [the backlash is] gonna come no matter what. It's not an easy subject to talk about, but I'm very fortunate with how it's doing.[243] Despite the controversy, the first season was a critical success.[244] However, the other three seasons received generally negative reviews.[245][246][247] *13 Reasons Why* was the most tweeted about show of 2017, and the most-watched original streaming series of 2018.[248][249] In 2022, its second season ranks as the ninth most watched English-language television series on Netflix, with 496.1 million hours viewed within 28 days of release.[250][251] The series ended after four seasons in June 2020.[252] Gomez recorded a cover version of the song \"Only You\" for the series' first season soundtrack.[253]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Gomez released the single \"Bad Liar\", alongside a vertical music video which was available for streaming only through Spotify;[254] it was the first-ever music video to premiere on Spotify.[255] The song received universal acclaim from music critics,[256][257][258] with some deeming it Gomez's best song to date;[259] *Billboard* ranked it as the best song of 2017.[260] *Rolling Stone* ranked \"Bad Liar\" at number 39 on its 2019 list of best songs of the 2010s.[261] Winston Cook-Wilson of *Spin* magazine found Gomez's vocals pristine and the track \"charmingly weird\", calling its lyrics and sample usage \"harebrained but ultimately brilliant\".

Jenner claims to have performed in plays while attending school, along with community plays.[27] In 2012, she became homeschooled and enrolled in an at-home education program, from which she graduated with a high school diploma in July 2015 from Laurel Springs School in Ojai, California.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2007–2012: *Keeping Up with the Kardashians*[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Jenner, along with her parents and siblings, Kendall, Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob, began appearing in the reality television series *Keeping Up with the Kardashians*, which chronicles the personal and professional lives of their family members.[30] The series was successful for its network, E!, and has resulted in the creation of numerous spin-offs including *Kourtney and Kim Take Miami*, *Khloé & Lamar*, *Kourtney and Kim Take New York*, and *Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons*, in which Jenner has made multiple guest appearances.[31] The sisters hosted *Glee: The 3D Concert Movie* at the Regency Village Theater in Westwood, Los Angeles in August 2011,[32] In 2011, they were featured in *Seventeen* magazine's Style Stars of the Year,[33][34] and selected them as \"Style Ambassadors\" for the magazine.[35] The two hosted the premiere of *The Vow* in Hollywood in February 2012.[36] The Jenners also interviewed the cast of *The Hunger Games* premiere at The Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles in March 2012.[37] Later in 2012, she starred alongside her sister Kendall and mother Kris Jenner in an episode of American reality television series America's Next Top Model.\n\n\n\n### 2013–2014: Early ventures[edit]\n\n\nThe Jenner sisters co-hosted the 2014 Much Music Video Awards, where Kylie made her acting debut in a promo for the show in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in June 2014.[38] In August 2014, the Jenner sisters appeared in singer PartyNextDoor's \"Recognize\" music video.[39] She also appeared in Jaden Smith's music video for his song \"Blue Ocean\".[40] Jenner and her sister Kendall co-authored the dystopian science fiction novel *Rebels: City of Indra: The Story of Lex and Livia*, which revolved around two twin girls, Lex and Livia, in a \"self-sustaining biosphere\" put together from the remains of Earth known as Indra.[41] The novel was criticized upon release as a ghostwritten work, which prompted its ghostwriter Maya Sloan to reveal that while the Jenner sisters wrote a two-page outline for what they wanted the novel to be like, Sloan was truly responsible for the writing of the book. However, the Jenners' creative director, Elizabeth Killmond-Roman, clarified that the two had numerous Skype and FaceTime calls with Sloan to discuss the content of the novel.[42] The novel was mostly panned by critics, and sold only 13,000 copies in its first four months on sale.[43] The book was also given a sequel, *Time of the Twins*, which was also co-authored by the Jenner sisters.\n\n\n\n### 2015–2018: Rise of Kylie Cosmetics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kendall (left) and Kylie Jenner, 2016\nThe Jenner sisters were booed while introducing brother-in-law Kanye West's performance at the Billboard Music Awards in May 2015.[44] In May 2015, an episode of *Keeping Up with the Kardashians* premiered in which Jenner admitted to getting a lip augmentation.[45] Her enhanced lips from lip fillers created speculation and gained her publicity. Prior to the episode's debut, Jenner stated that she merely used lip liner and over lined her lips.[46] As a result, the practice of suctioning one's lips into a small glass in order to induce greater blood flow to swell the lips was called the \"Kylie Jenner Challenge\" (though there was no indication that Jenner herself employed this method).[47] Jenner responded to this by stating, \"I'm not here to try & encourage people/young girls to look like me or to think this is the way they should look.\"[48] In August 2015, Jenner announced that she would be launching her first lipstick line as a part of her self-titled lip kit under the name Kylie Lip Kit.[49] In November 2015, the Jenner sisters appeared in singer Justine Skye's \"I'm Yours\" music video.[50]\n\n\nIn February 2016, Jenner's cosmetic company was renamed to Kylie Cosmetics and the number of kits produced rose from an initial 15,000 to 500,000.[51] Jenner released a three-minute-long promotional video for a series of lip glosses in March 2016, directed by Colin Tilley and starring fellow models Karin Jinsui, Mara Teigen, and Jasmine Sanders.[52][53][54][55][56] The song in the video was revealed to be \"Three Strikes\" by Terror Jr, a band created on the same day as the release of the video; however, the lead singer, who was later revealed to be singer Lisa Vatale,[57] was heavily speculated to be Jenner herself.[58][59][60][61] However, Jenner subsequently denied any involvement with the band.[62][63] In May 2016, she made her musical debut rapping on producer Burberry Perry's song \"Beautiful Day\", with Lil Yachty, Jordyn Woods, and Justine Skye.[64] The next month, Jenner starred in another PartyNextDoor's music video for his song \"Come and See Me\".[65] In April 2017, she made a surprise appearance at the Rio Americano High School prom in Sacramento alongside junior Albert Ochoa after hearing that his date had turned him down.[66][67][68]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Jenner was placed at number 59 on the *Forbes* Celebrity 100, which calculates the 100 highest-paid celebrities of the previous 12 months, after earning approximately US$41,000,000, making her the youngest person on the list at 19 years old.[11]\n\n\nJenner starred in a reality show revolving around her life, *Life of Kylie*,[69] which premiered in August 2017.

The magazine claimed she had a net worth of $900 million and that she was on the verge of becoming the youngest \"self-made\" billionaire.[148] This would beat Mark Zuckerberg, who became a billionaire at age 23.[149] However, the publication's use of the term \"self-made\" sparked widespread criticism and jokes online.[150] Critics argued that Jenner was already born into fame and fortune.[151] Some discussions took a more serious tone, with journalists writing pieces on wealth distribution, inequality and inheritance, as well as upward mobility in society.[152][153][154] However, celebrities such as Jenner's half-sister Kim Kardashian and socialite Paris Hilton have come out and defended Jenner, legitimizing assertions that she is indeed self-made, while Hilton who was born into the Hilton family also described herself as self-made.[155][156]\n\n\nIn May 2020, *Forbes* released a statement accusing Jenner of forging tax documents so she would appear as a billionaire.[17] The publication also accused her of fabricating revenue figures for Kylie Cosmetics.[17] The same day, Jenner responded in a series of tweets, writing: \"What am I even waking up to?

She starred in the E! reality television series *Keeping Up with the Kardashians* from 2007 to 2021 and then the Hulu reality television series *The Kardashians* from 2022. She is the founder and owner of cosmetic company Kylie Cosmetics. She is the fifth-most-followed person on Instagram.\n\n\nAt age 14 in 2012, Jenner collaborated with the clothing brand PacSun, along with her sister Kendall, and created a line of clothing, Kendall & Kylie. In 2015, she launched her own cosmetics line called Kylie Lip Kits, which was renamed to Kylie Cosmetics the following year.[8]\n\n\nJenner has been an influential figure in culture since the mid 2010s. In 2014 and 2015, *Time* magazine listed the Jenner sisters on their list of the most influential teens in the world, citing their considerable influence among youth on social media.[9][10] In 2017, Jenner was placed on the *Forbes* Celebrity 100 list, making her the youngest person to be featured on the list.[11] Jenner starred on her own spin-off series, *Life of Kylie*, which premiered in 2017.[12]\n\n\nJenner's wealth and its coverage on the magazine *Forbes* has been a source of controversy in the past. In 2019, the magazine estimated Jenner's net worth at US$1 billion and called her the world's youngest self-made billionaire at age 21;[13][14] the notion of Jenner being self-made has been controversial.[15][16] In May 2020, *Forbes* released a statement accusing Jenner of forging tax documents so she would appear as a billionaire.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nKylie Kristen Jenner was born on August 10, 1997, in Los Angeles, California. The youngest daughter of former Olympic decathlete champion Caitlyn Jenner (then known as Bruce Jenner)[b][19] and television personality and businesswoman Kris Jenner (née Houghton).[20] From both of her parents' side, she is of Dutch, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry, with some Welsh ancestry from her father's side.[21] Jenner has an older sister, Kendall and eight older half-siblings. [22] From Caitlyn's side of the family, she has three older half-brothers―Burt, Brandon, and Brody Jenner―and one older half-sister Cassandra Marino.[23] From Kris' side of the family, Jenner has three older half-sisters―Kourtney, Kim, Khloé―and one older half-brother Rob Kardashian.[24] Her parents divorced in 2015,[25] prior to her father's transition.[26]\n\n\nJenner attended Sierra Canyon School, where she was also a member of the cheerleading team. Jenner claims to have performed in plays while attending school, along with community plays.[27] In 2012, she became homeschooled and enrolled in an at-home education program, from which she graduated with a high school diploma in July 2015 from Laurel Springs School in Ojai, California.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2007–2012: *Keeping Up with the Kardashians*[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Jenner, along with her parents and siblings, Kendall, Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob, began appearing in the reality television series *Keeping Up with the Kardashians*, which chronicles the personal and professional lives of their family members.[30] The series was successful for its network, E!, and has resulted in the creation of numerous spin-offs including *Kourtney and Kim Take Miami*, *Khloé & Lamar*, *Kourtney and Kim Take New York*, and *Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons*, in which Jenner has made multiple guest appearances.[31] The sisters hosted *Glee: The 3D Concert Movie* at the Regency Village Theater in Westwood, Los Angeles in August 2011,[32] In 2011, they were featured in *Seventeen* magazine's Style Stars of the Year,[33][34] and selected them as \"Style Ambassadors\" for the magazine.[35] The two hosted the premiere of *The Vow* in Hollywood in February 2012.[36] The Jenners also interviewed the cast of *The Hunger Games* premiere at The Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles in March 2012.[37] Later in 2012, she starred alongside her sister Kendall and mother Kris Jenner in an episode of American reality television series America's Next Top Model.\n\n\n\n### 2013–2014: Early ventures[edit]\n\n\nThe Jenner sisters co-hosted the 2014 Much Music Video Awards, where Kylie made her acting debut in a promo for the show in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in June 2014.[38] In August 2014, the Jenner sisters appeared in singer PartyNextDoor's \"Recognize\" music video.[39] She also appeared in Jaden Smith's music video for his song \"Blue Ocean\".[40] Jenner and her sister Kendall co-authored the dystopian science fiction novel *Rebels: City of Indra: The Story of Lex and Livia*, which revolved around two twin girls, Lex and Livia, in a \"self-sustaining biosphere\" put together from the remains of Earth known as Indra.[41] The novel was criticized upon release as a ghostwritten work, which prompted its ghostwriter Maya Sloan to reveal that while the Jenner sisters wrote a two-page outline for what they wanted the novel to be like, Sloan was truly responsible for the writing of the book. However, the Jenners' creative director, Elizabeth Killmond-Roman, clarified that the two had numerous Skype and FaceTime calls with Sloan to discuss the content of the novel.[42] The novel was mostly panned by critics, and sold only 13,000 copies in its first four months on sale.[43] The book was also given a sequel, *Time of the Twins*, which was also co-authored by the Jenner sisters.\n\n\n\n### 2015–2018: Rise of Kylie Cosmetics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kendall (left) and Kylie Jenner, 2016\nThe Jenner sisters were booed while introducing brother-in-law Kanye West's performance at the Billboard Music Awards in May 2015.[44] In May 2015, an episode of *Keeping Up with the Kardashians* premiered in which Jenner admitted to getting a lip augmentation.[45] Her enhanced lips from lip fillers created speculation and gained her publicity. Prior to the episode's debut, Jenner stated that she merely used lip liner and over lined her lips.[46] As a result, the practice of suctioning one's lips into a small glass in order to induce greater blood flow to swell the lips was called the \"Kylie Jenner Challenge\" (though there was no indication that Jenner herself employed this method).[47] Jenner responded to this by stating, \"I'm not here to try & encourage people/young girls to look like me or to think this is the way they should look.\"[48] In August 2015, Jenner announced that she would be launching her first lipstick line as a part of her self-titled lip kit under the name Kylie Lip Kit.[49] In November 2015, the Jenner sisters appeared in singer Justine Skye's \"I'm Yours\" music video.[50]\n\n\nIn February 2016, Jenner's cosmetic company was renamed to Kylie Cosmetics and the number of kits produced rose from an initial 15,000 to 500,000.[51] Jenner released a three-minute-long promotional video for a series of lip glosses in March 2016, directed by Colin Tilley and starring fellow models Karin Jinsui, Mara Teigen, and Jasmine Sanders.[52][53][54][55][56] The song in the video was revealed to be \"Three Strikes\" by Terror Jr, a band created on the same day as the release of the video; however, the lead singer, who was later revealed to be singer Lisa Vatale,[57] was heavily speculated to be Jenner herself.[58][59][60][61] However, Jenner subsequently denied any involvement with the band.[62][63] In May 2016, she made her musical debut rapping on producer Burberry Perry's song \"Beautiful Day\", with Lil Yachty, Jordyn Woods, and Justine Skye.[64] The next month, Jenner starred in another PartyNextDoor's music video for his song \"Come and See Me\".[65] In April 2017, she made a surprise appearance at the Rio Americano High School prom in Sacramento alongside junior Albert Ochoa after hearing that his date had turned him down.[66][67][68]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Jenner was placed at number 59 on the *Forbes* Celebrity 100, which calculates the 100 highest-paid celebrities of the previous 12 months, after earning approximately US$41,000,000, making her the youngest person on the list at 19 years old.[11]\n\n\nJenner starred in a reality show revolving around her life, *Life of Kylie*,[69] which premiered in August 2017. On mother's day 2018, Kylie Cosmetics launched makeup line called Kris Cosmetics, in collaboration with her mother Kris Jenner.[70] Jenner and her half-sister Kim Kardashian launched their second collaboration KKW x Kylie Cosmetics collection on Black Friday 2018 after previously launched the first collection in 2017.[71] The same month, she launched Kylie Cosmetics mobile app.[72]\n\n\n\n### 2019–2020: Debut of Kylie Skin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jenner for *Vogue*\nIn April 2019, Jenner and her half-sister Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty teamed up to launch a new fragrance. This collaboration became Jenner's first foray into fragrance and it launched on April 26.[73] Jenner founded her own skincare brand Kylie Skin which was launched on May 22.[74][75] The brand began producing dermis products, including face washes, scrubs, moisturizers and makeup removing wipes. On June 14, 2019, Kylie Cosmetics launched their collaboration with her half-sister Khloé Kardashian called Kylie Cosmetics x Koko Kollection. This marked their third collaboration after previously launched special collection of lip products called Koko Kollection in 2016 and the second part in 2017.[76] In September, Jenner announced that she was serving as the makeup artistic director for Balmain's Spring 2020 runway show at Paris Fashion Week. To celebrate the new line, Kylie Cosmetics and Balmain launched a capsule makeup collection and available on September 27, the day of the show, on the Kylie Cosmetics website. This was the first time Jenner collaborated on a makeup collection with someone outside of her family's inner circle.[77]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Jenner filed to trademark the phrase \"rise and shine\", a line that became a meme when footage of Jenner singing the phrase to her daughter, Stormi, went viral.[78] The hashtag #RiseandShine reached one billion views on TikTok, making it the platform's fastest-growing hashtag trend.[79] In addition to the standard \"rise and shine\", Jenner also filed to trademark \"riiise and shiiinnee\".[80] The latter trademark would cover clothing while the former would also apply to cosmetics.[81][82] The next month, Jenner sold a 51 percent stake in Kylie Cosmetics to Coty, which owns other beauty brands including Covergirl, OPI, Rimmel, GHD and Clairol for $600 million.[83]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Jenner announced she had trademarked Kylie Con, Kylie Kon, and Kylie Museum.[84] In the same month, her sister Kendall confirmed that a cosmetics line in collaboration with Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics was in the process. Kylie Cosmetics launched Kylie Cosmetics x Kendall Jenner on June 26, 2020.[85] Still in the same month, Jenner announced that Kylie Cosmetics will launch a Valentine's Day Collection named after Jenner's daughter, Stormi. The Stormi Collection was launched in February 1, the same day as her daughter's birthday.[86] Jenner made a cameo appearance in singers Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber's \"Stuck with U\" music video in May 2020. The following month, the Jenners sisters addressed reports that their fashion brand Kendall + Kylie has failed to pay factory workers in Bangladesh as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was reported that Global Brands Group (GBG) previously listed the Kendall + Kylie brand on its website. As a result, the Jenners stated that their company is owned by a separate entity known as 3072541 Canada Inc. even though they say that their brand \"has worked with CAA-GBG in the past, in a sales and business development capacity only\" and that they \"do not currently have any relationship at all with GBG\".[87] In August 2020, Kylie Cosmetics launched Summer Sailor collection which marked the launch of Jenner's first-ever false lashes.[88] In the same month, she made a cameo in Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's \"WAP\" music video, alongside singers Normani and Rosalía; a petition asking that Jenner's cameo be edited out of the video reached over 65,000 signatures.[89]\n\n\nJenner topped the *Forbes* list of highest paid celebrities for 2020.[90]\n\n\n\n### 2021–present: Business and television expansions[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Jenner and her family announced that their reality show, *Keeping Up With the Kardashians*, would be ending after twenty seasons and almost 15 years on air.[91][92][93]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Jenner teased Kylie Swim, a new swimwear line that includes sizes for all women.[94] On September 17, it was officially launched on Kylie Jenner's website.[95] Following release, the company received a lot of backlash on social media, with people saying that the products were poor quality and impractical, saying that they should only be used for Instagram photos.[96][97][98] On September 21, she announced a new skincare and hair product line for babies, called Kylie Baby.[99]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Jenner became the first woman to gain 300 million followers on the social network service Instagram, surpassing the previous recordholder, singer Ariana Grande.[100]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Jenner and her family returned to the television screens with their brand new reality television show, titled *The Kardashians*, after they left the E! Network to join Hulu.[101][102][103] The show features Jenner, alongside her sisters Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Kendall, and mother Kris Jenner, it also features ex and current partners including Scott Disick, Travis Barker, Tristan Thompson, and Corey Gamble, with Kanye West making a guest appearance.[104] The first season premiered on 14 April 2022, and its ten episodes can be streamed exclusively on Disney+.[105][106] Later in 2022, the show was announced to be returning for a second season, which officially premiered on 22 September 2022.[107][108] In late 2022, it was announced that the show had been officially renewed for a third season, set to premier in the first half of 2023.[109][110][111] The third season officially aired on 25 May 2023.[112][113][114]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2014, Tyga was seen getting close with Jenner at her 17th birthday party. Days later, Tyga ended his relationship with Blac Chyna, his fiancée and the mother of his son.[115][116] In 2015, when she turned 18, Jenner and Tyga made their relationship official.[117][118] Jenner subsequently made appearances in two of Tyga's music videos, \"Stimulated\" and \"Dope'd Up\".[119] In April 2017, Jenner and Tyga broke up.[120]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Jenner was first seen with Travis Scott at Coachella.[121] On February 1, 2018, Jenner gave birth to their daughter.[122][123] Jenner appeared in the music video for \"Stop Trying to Be God\", from Scott's third studio album *Astroworld*.[124] They broke up in September 2019,[125][126] but quarantined together during the COVID-19 pandemic for the sake of their daughter and ended up rekindling their relationship.[127][128] On September 7, 2021, after weeks of speculation, Jenner revealed that she and Scott were expecting their second child.[129] Jenner gave birth to their son on February 2, 2022.[130][131][132] In January 2023, it was reported that the couple has split up again.[133]\n\n\n\n### Friendship with Jordyn Woods[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Jenner and Jordyn Woods met through their mutual friend, Jaden Smith, son of Hollywood actor Will Smith and actress Jada Pinkett Smith.[134] They were close friends for many years, with Woods appearing in Jenner's 2017 reality TV show, *Life of Kylie,*[135] and Jenner's 2018 pregnancy video. In September 2018, Kylie Cosmetics launched the Kylie x Jordyn collection, a collaboration between the two friends.[136] Their friendship ended in 2019 as a result of Woods cheating with Tristan Thompson, who was the fiancé of Jenner's half-sister Khloé Kardashian.[137] Jenner discontinued her Woods-named lip kit, cutting the price to eliminate remaining inventory.[138]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Kendall + Kylie \"Rock vs. Rap\" collection[edit]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2017, the Jenner sisters announced that they would be releasing a line of vintage T-shirts for their Kendall + Kylie line of clothing called Rock vs. Rap,[139][140] featuring the likenesses of various rock and rap artists[141] including The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Metallica, Pink Floyd, The Doors, Ozzy Osbourne, and Led Zeppelin, with pictures of the Jenner sisters superimposed over them.[139] The announcement of this line of products was met with swift backlash from relatives and representatives of the figures depicted on the shirts themselves, including Sharon Osbourne,[142] Jim Jampol,[143] and Voletta Wallace, mother of Biggie Smalls.[144] They were also criticized on social media and were called \"insensitive.\"[145] Wallace, The Doors' manager and the estate of Jim Morrison issued a cease-and-desist letter to the Jenner sisters, writing that they did not authorize the sisters' use of the likenesses of these musical icons.[146][147] The Jenners apologized for the shirts, and pulled them from retail.[139]\n\n\n\n### *Forbes* cover[edit]\n\n\nJenner appeared on the cover of the August 2018 issue of *Forbes*. The magazine claimed she had a net worth of $900 million and that she was on the verge of becoming the youngest \"self-made\" billionaire.[148] This would beat Mark Zuckerberg, who became a billionaire at age 23.[149] However, the publication's use of the term \"self-made\" sparked widespread criticism and jokes online.[150] Critics argued that Jenner was already born into fame and fortune.[151] Some discussions took a more serious tone, with journalists writing pieces on wealth distribution, inequality and inheritance, as well as upward mobility in society.[152][153][154] However, celebrities such as Jenner's half-sister Kim Kardashian and socialite Paris Hilton have come out and defended Jenner, legitimizing assertions that she is indeed self-made, while Hilton who was born into the Hilton family also described herself as self-made.[155][156]\n\n\nIn May 2020, *Forbes* released a statement accusing Jenner of forging tax documents so she would appear as a billionaire.[17] The publication also accused her of fabricating revenue figures for Kylie Cosmetics.[17] The same day, Jenner responded in a series of tweets, writing: \"What am I even waking up to? I thought this was a reputable site... All I see are a number of inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol. I've never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there EVER. Period\". Jenner's attorney also demanded that *Forbes* retract the statements, calling the magazine's accusations \"unequivocally false\". *Forbes* reacted, stating that they spent months uncovering the facts and concluded that their \"extensively-reported investigation was triggered by newly-filed documents that revealed glaring discrepancies between information privately supplied to journalists and information publicly supplied to shareholders\".[157] However, Jenner became the youngest person on *Forbes*'s list of 100 Richest Self-Made Women in October 2020. She is the only person on the list in her 20s, and is worth $700 million.[158]\n\n\n\n### Cultural appropriation[edit]\n\n\nJenner has been accused of appropriating African-American culture and style.[159] In 2016, Jenner was criticized for posting a photograph of herself wearing cornrows on Instagram.[160] In June 2017, urban streetwear brand PluggedNYC accused Jenner of stealing their designs for her collection of camouflage swimwear.[161]\n\n\n\n### Underpaying factory workers[edit]\n\n\nRemake, a non-profit, labeled Global Brands Group as the manufacturer for the Kendall + Kylie clothing line.[162] The organization claimed that money was being withheld from workers in the factories despite having finishing their work. The organization also reported them firing workers in Los Angeles, affecting over fifty-thousand workers.[163] She received criticism for this on multiple platforms, with fans asking her to pay her workers.[164] In response to this, the clothing line said that Kendall + Kylie was not owned by Global Brands Group.[165]\n\n\n\n### Lawsuits and civil disputes[edit]\n\n\n#### Vlada Haggarty[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, make-up artist Vlada Haggarty claimed that Jenner had stolen the creative style and aesthetic of her own work, such as the dripping gloss lip and golden finger tips, for her own products, and that Jenner had a history of taking Haggerty's original dripping lip art and passing it off as her own. Jenner later credited Vlada on social media and her work on the creation of the logo and an undisclosed settlement was paid to avoid any future legal issues.[166][167][168]\n\n\n\n#### \"Kylie\" trademark[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Australian singer Kylie Minogue won a legal battle against Jenner for name trademark \"Kylie\". Jenner had filed a U.S. trademark application for use of the name \"Kylie\" for \"advertising services\" and \"endorsement services\" in 2015.[169]\n\n\n\n#### Neon lip logo[edit]\n\n\nSara Pope, a British painter whose work has been featured in art galleries in several cities across the globe, filed a lawsuit against Jenner and NBC Universal for the use of a neon lip logo. Pope stated that Jenner posted to her social media accounts an image that was remarkably similar to Pope's most famous piece, \"Temptation Neon\" and used it to promote Jenner's TV series *Life of Kylie*. TMZ reported that the production art created for the series, including the lip design, was created by a third party designer.[170]\n\n\n\n#### Seed Beauty[edit]\n\n\nSeed Beauty filed a lawsuit against Coty and Kylie Cosmetics, alleging that Coty has purchased $600 million in Kylie Cosmetics stock from Jenner as a subterfuge to learn trade secrets.[171]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jenner being interviewed for Nip + Fab in 2015\nJenner has two nail lacquers from the Nicole by OPI nail polish brand called Wear Something Spar-kylie and Rainbow in the S-kylie.[172] Jenner and her sister Kendall earned $100,000 each for their OPI endorsements in 2013.[173] On November 15, 2013, the Jenner sisters announced that they would launch The Kendall & Kylie Collection with PacSun[174] which launched in February 2013.

In fall the same year, Jenner was announced to be the new face of PUMA along with Rae Sremmurd.[186] In 2017, Jenner became the face of Beats Headphones special edition collection in collaboration between Apple and Balmain.[187] Jenner collaborated with Melbourne-based sunglasses brand Quay Australia[188][189] to release a line of sunglasses, *Quay x Kylie*. This collaboration was launched in June 2017.[190][191][192] She endorsed Calvin Klein along with her sisters in 2018. In the same year she signed a deal with Adidas to become their ambassador. Jenner also had endorsed hair vitamin SugarBearHair, Waist Gang Society waist trainer, monthly beauty subscription service Boxycharm, detox tea Fit Tea and Fashion Nova.[193] In 2018, Jenner reportedly made $1 million per sponsored Instagram post, making her the highest paid individuals on Instagram in 2018. The next year Jenner reportedly made $1.2 million per sponsored Instagram post, remaining her as the highest paid individuals on Instagram for the second year in a row.[194]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jenner in 2017\nJenner set up an eBay account where she auctions old clothing to raise money for the Children's Hospital Los Angeles.[195] She joined her sisters Khloé and Kendall, along with Lil Twist, and The Game at PINZ bowling alley in Studio City, California for a charity bowling game on January 19, 2014. The event was held to raise money for The Robin Hood Foundation, a nonprofit for which The Game pledged to raise $1 million in donations.[196] The Jenner sisters participated in singer Chris Brown's two Kick'n It For Charity Celebrity Kickball games in Glendale, California on July 19, 2014[197] and on August 16, 2014.[198] At the first game, she competed on actor/singer Quincy Brown's team.\n\n\nIn December 2015, Jenner made a donation of Christmas gifts to the Los Angeles LGBT Teen Center.[199] In January 2017, Jenner donated $10,000 to her then-friend Jordyn Woods to help cover memorial costs for Woods's father after he died from cancer.[200] On her birthday in the same year, Jenner announced on her Instagram she donated $500,000 from sales of her Birthday Collection to Teen Cancer America, an organization to help hospital and outpatient facilities develop special units for teens with cancer.[201] Jenner is an ambassador for Smile Train, a charity that funds surgery for children with cleft lips and palates.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time,[6][7] he was integral to the development and success of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) during the Attitude Era, an industry boom period in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Johnson wrestled for the WWF for eight years before pursuing an acting career. His films have grossed over $3.5 billion in North America and over $10.5 billion worldwide,[8] making him one of the world's highest-grossing and highest-paid actors.[9][10][11]\n\n\nAfter accepting an athletic scholarship to play football at the University of Miami, he was a member of the 1991 national championship team, but was largely a backup player.[12] Despite aspirations to professional football, he went undrafted in the 1995 NFL draft, and briefly signed with the Calgary Stampeders before being cut in his first season.[13] In 1996, Johnson's father Rocky assisted in helping him secure a contract with the WWF.[2] Johnson quickly rose to global prominence, aided by a gimmick he employed as a charismatic trash talker. Johnson left the WWE in 2004 and returned in 2011 as a part-time performer until 2013, making sporadic appearances until retiring in 2019.[14] A 10-time world champion, including the promotion's first of African-American descent,[15] he is also a two-time Intercontinental Champion, a five-time Tag Team Champion, the 2000 Royal Rumble winner, and WWE's sixth Triple Crown champion. Johnson headlined the most-bought professional wrestling pay-per-view (WrestleMania XXVIII) and was featured among the most watched episodes of WWE's flagship television series (*Raw* and *SmackDown*).[16][17]\n\n\nJohnson's first film role was in *The Mummy Returns* (2001). The next year, he played his first leading role in the action fantasy film *The Scorpion King*. He has since starred in family films *The Game Plan* (2007), *Race to Witch Mountain* (2009), *Tooth Fairy* (2010), *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* (2017), *Jumanji: The Next Level* (2019), and *Jungle Cruise* (2021), and the action films *Journey 2: The Mysterious Island* (2012), *G.I. Joe: Retaliation* (2013), *Hercules* (2014), *Skyscraper* (2018), *San Andreas* (2015) and *Rampage* (2018). He also starred in the action comedy films *Get Smart* (2008), *Central Intelligence* (2016), *Baywatch* (2017), and *Red Notice* (2021). His role as Luke Hobbs in the *Fast & Furious* films, beginning with *Fast Five* (2011), helped the franchise become one of the highest-grossing in film.[18] He joined the DC Extended Universe playing the title role in *Black Adam* (2022).[19] He is also known for voicing Maui in the Disney animated film *Moana* (2016) and is set to reprise the role in the upcoming live action remake.[20]\n\n\nJohnson produced and starred in the HBO comedy-drama series *Ballers* (2015–2019)[21] and the autobiographical sitcom *Young Rock* (2021). His autobiography, *The Rock Says*, was released in 2000 and was a *New York Times* bestseller.[22][23] In 2012, he co-founded the entertainment production company Seven Bucks Productions.[24] Johnson is a co-owner of the XFL, a professional American football league, which he acquired from WWE owner Vince McMahon for $15 million in 2020.[25][26][27] In 2016 and 2019, *Time* named Johnson one of the world's most influential people.[28][29]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJohnson was born in Hayward, California,[30] on May 2, 1972,[31] the son of Ata Johnson (née Maivia)[32] and former professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles).[33][34] Growing up, he briefly lived in Grey Lynn in Auckland, New Zealand, with his mother's family,[35] where he played rugby[36] and attended Richmond Road Primary School before returning to the U.S.[35]\n\n\nJohnson's father was a Black Nova Scotian with a small amount of Irish ancestry.[37][38] His mother is Samoan. His father and Tony Atlas were the first black tag team champions in WWE history, in 1983.[39][40] His mother is the adopted daughter of Peter Maivia, who was also a professional wrestler.[41] Johnson's maternal grandmother Lia was one of the first female pro wrestling promoters, taking over Polynesian Pacific Pro Wrestling after her husband's death in 1982 and managing it until 1988.[42][43] Through his maternal grandfather Maivia, Johnson is a non-blood relative of the Anoa'i wrestling family.[44][45][46][47][48] In 2008, he inducted his father and grandfather into the WWE Hall of Fame.[49]\n\n\nJohnson attended Montclaire Elementary School in Charlotte, North Carolina, before moving to Hamden, Connecticut, where he attended Shepherd Glen Elementary School and then Hamden Middle School.[50][51] He attended President William McKinley High School in Honolulu and then Glencliff High School and McGavock High School, both in Nashville, and then Freedom High School in Bethlehem Township in the Lehigh Valley, from which he graduated in 1990.[52]\n\n\nAt Freedom High School, Johnson initially struggled and was drawn into a culture of conflict and petty crime. By age 17, he had been arrested several times for fighting, theft, and check fraud, and was suspended two weeks for fighting.[53] The local newspaper later called him \"a troubled teenager with a history of run-ins with police.\" But Freedom High School football coach Jody Cwik saw athletic potential in Johnson, and recruited him to join the football team, where he played defensive tackle. The experience proved the beginning of a personal transformation for Johnson. \"My thought process started to change. That's when I started thinking about goals and what I wanted to accomplish\", he has since said about his high school football experience.[12] In addition to playing football, Johnson also was a member of Freedom High School's track and field and wrestling teams. [33]\n\n\nBy his senior year, Johnson had played only two years of football, but was offered a full athletic scholarship offer from the University of Miami.[12]\n\n\n\n## Football career[edit]\n\n\n### College career[edit]\n\n\n\n\nDwayne Johnson| No. 94 |\n| --- |\n| Position | Defensive tackle |\n| Major | Criminology and physiology |\n| Personal information |\n| Born: | May 2, 1972 (1972-05-02) (age 52)Hayward, California, U.S. |\n| Height | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) |\n| Weight | 253 lb (115 kg) |\n| Career history |\n| College | * Miami (FL) (1990–1994)\n |\n| Bowl games | * Cotton Bowl Classic (1991)\n* Orange Bowl (1992)\n |\n| High school | Freedom High School(Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) |\n| Career highlights and awards |\n| * AP Poll national champion (1991)\n |\n\n\nAs he did in high school, Johnson continued to play defensive tackle at the University of Miami. He was a member of the Miami Hurricanes football team during his freshman year in 1991, and won that year's national championship.[54][33] Despite playing four years there, Johnson found himself behind elite players on the depth chart, including future NFL star and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Warren Sapp, and appeared mostly in backup roles.[55][56] In his time at Miami, Johnson played in 39 games with one start. He recorded 4.25 sacks and 77 tackles.[57]\n\n\nIn 1995, Johnson graduated with a Bachelor of General Studies and a dual major in criminology and physiology.[58] He was also one of the university's most prolific student speakers in the Miami-area community, frequently delivering positive messages about his own struggles and encouraging students to remain in school and avoid the dangers of drug use.[59]\n\n\n\n### Canadian Football League[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating, Johnson was signed by the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. Calgary moved him from defensive tackle to linebacker. He was assigned to Calgary's practice roster, but was cut two months into Calgary's 1995 season.[33][60][61]\n\n\n\n## Professional wrestling career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career (1996)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on |\n| Professional wrestling |\n| ![](image) |\n| History\n* History of professional wrestling\n\t+ By year\n* Early wrestling championships\n* Gold Dust Trio\n* 1980s boom\n* Black Saturday\n* 1994 NWA World Title Tournament\n* Monday Night Wars\n* Attitude Era\n* 2000 All Japan Pro Wrestling mass exodus\n* The Invasion\n* Wednesday Night Wars\n |\n| Notable promotions\n* All Elite Wrestling\n* All Japan Pro Wrestling\n* All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling\n* American Wrestling Association\n* Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\n* Extreme Championship Wrestling\n* Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling\n* Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling\n* Jim Crockett Promotions\n* Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide\n* National Wrestling Alliance\n* New Japan Pro-Wrestling\n* Pro Wrestling Noah\n* Ring of Honor\n* Tokyo Joshi Pro-Wrestling\n* Total Nonstop Action Wrestling\n* UWF International\n* Women of Wrestling\n* World Championship Wrestling\n* World Wonder Ring Stardom\n* WWE\n* Others\n |\n| Notable people\n**Early 20th Century**\n* George Hackenschmidt\n* The Great Gama\n* Frank Gotch\n* Billy Sandow\n* Toots Mondt\n* Ed Lewis\n* Jack Pfefer\n* Jim Londos\n* Salvador Lutteroth\n* Lou Thesz\n\n\n**Mid 20th Century**\n\n* Gorgeous George\n* El Santo\n* Sam Muchnick\n* Mildred Burke\n* The Fabulous Moolah\n* Blue Demon\n* Verne Gagne\n* Karl Gotch\n* Rikidōzan\n* Stu Hart\n* Bruno Sammartino\n\n\n**1970s and 1980s**\n\n* Terry Funk\n* Harley Race\n* Gordon Solie\n* Antonio Inoki\n* Giant Baba\n* Mil Máscaras\n* André the Giant\n* Carlos Colón\n* Dusty Rhodes\n* Ric Flair\n* Jim Crockett Jr.\n* Big Daddy\n* Vince McMahon\n* Dynamite Kid\n* Satoru \"Tiger Mask\" Sayama\n* Hulk Hogan\n* Randy Savage\n* Hisashi Shinma\n* Akira Maeda\n\n\n**1990s**\n\n* Ted Turner\n* Sting\n* The Great Muta\n* The Undertaker\n* Jim Ross\n* Mitsuharu Misawa\n* Kenta Kobashi\n* Toshiaki Kawada\n* Atsushi Onita\n* Antonio Peña\n* Eric Bischoff\n* Paul Heyman\n* Jim Cornette\n* Bret Hart\n* Shawn Michaels\n* Kevin Nash\n* Scott Hall\n* Vince Russo\n* Stone Cold Steve Austin\n* The Rock\n* Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque\n\n\n**2000s**\n\n* Chris Jericho\n* Jeff Jarrett\n* Eddie Guerrero\n* Rey Mysterio\n* Brock Lesnar\n* John Cena\n* Hiroshi Tanahashi\n* Místico\n\n\n**2010s and 2020s**\n\n* CM Punk\n* Bryan Danielson\n* Roman Reigns\n* Kazuchika Okada\n* Kenny Omega\n* Tony Khan\n* Nick Khan\n* Cody Rhodes\n |\n| By region\n* Australia\n* Bolivia\n* Canada\n* China\n* France\n* India\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Mexico\n* New Zealand\n* Puerto Rico\n* Russia\n* Saudi Arabia\n* United Kingdom\n* United States\n |\n| Styles\n* British wrestling\n\t+ All-in style\n\t+ Mountevans rules\n* Catch-as-catch-can\n* Cruiserweight\n\t+ X Division\n* Hardcore\n* Intergender\n* *Lucha libre*\n* Midget\n\t+ *Mini-Estrella*\n* *Puroresu*\n* Shoot style\n\t+ *U-Kei*\n* Women's\n |\n| Concepts\n* Attire\n\t+ Masks\n\t+ Wrestling singlet\n\t+ Wrestling shoe\n* Backyarding\n* Blading\n* Championship\n\t+ World Heavyweight\n* Dirt sheet\n* Glossary of terms\n\t+ Kayfabe\n\t+ Gimmick\n\t+ Face\n\t+ Heel\n\t+ Shoot\n\t+ Heat\n\t+ Job\n\t+ Push\n* House show\n* Match types\n* Music\n* Rib\n* Ring name\n* Sports entertainment\n* Tag team\n* Weight classes\n* Wrestling ring\n |\n| Culture\n* Cauliflower Alley Club\n* Cauliflower ear\n* Comic books\n* Films\n\t+ Luchador films\n* Magazines\n* Paintings\n\t+ Gustave Courbet\n\t+ Thomas Eakins\n\t+ William Etty\n\t+ George Luks\n* Ribera Steakhouse\n* Sculpture\n* Ten-bell salute\n* Video games\n* Wrestling personalities in politics\n* Zubaz\n |\n| Media outlets\n* *Botchamania*\n* *Box y Lucha*\n* *Dark Side of the Ring*\n* *Fighting Spirit Magazine*\n* *Live Audio Wrestling*\n* *OSW Review*\n* *Power Slam*\n* *Pro Wrestling Illustrated*\n* *Súper Luchas*\n* *Wrestling Observer Newsletter*\n |\n| Controversies\n* Animals in professional wrestling\n* Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide\n* Death of Owen Hart\n* Mass Transit incident\n* Montreal Screwjob\n* Murder of Bruiser Brody\n* Murder of Rikidōzan\n* Premature deaths\n* Speaking Out\n* *United States v.

Wrestling at first under his real name, Johnson defeated The Brooklyn Brawler at a house show on March 10[62] and lost matches to Chris Candido and Owen Hart.[35] After wrestling at Jerry Lawler's United States Wrestling Association under the name Flex Kavana and winning the USWA tag team championship twice with his partner Bart Sawyer in the summer of 1996, Johnson was signed to a WWF contract. He received additional training from Tom Prichard, alongside Achim Albrecht and Mark Henry.[5][35]\n\n\n\n### World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment[edit]\n\n\n#### Debut; Intercontinental Champion (1996–1997)[edit]\n\n\nJohnson made his WWF debut as Rocky Maivia, a combination of his father and grandfather's ring names, although announcers acknowledged his real name.[63] He was initially reluctant to take this ring name but was persuaded by Vince McMahon and Jim Ross.[43][64] He was given the nickname \"The Blue Chipper\", and to play up his lineage, he was hyped as the WWF's first third-generation wrestler.[3] A clean-cut face character, Maivia was pushed heavily from the start despite his wrestling inexperience. He debuted on *Monday Night Raw* as a member of Marc Mero's entourage on November 4, 1996.[65] His first match came at Survivor Series, on November 17, 1996, in an eight-man elimination tag match; he was the sole survivor and eliminated the final two members of the opposing team, Crush and Goldust.[66] On February 13, 1997, he won the Intercontinental Championship from Hunter Hearst Helmsley on *Monday Night Raw*.[67][68][69] Maivia then successfully defended the title against Helmsley at In Your House 13: Final Four.\n\n\nJohnson's first WrestleMania match came at WrestleMania 13 on March 23, 1997, where he was victorious in his Intercontinental Championship defense against The Sultan. WWF fans started to reject his character and push from the company.[70] He defeated Bret Hart by disqualification in a title defense on the March 31 episode of *Raw is War*.[71] Behind the scenes, Hart mentored Johnson for his first year in WWF[72] and refused to be booked to take the title from him.[73] On April 20, at In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker, he lost to Savio Vega by countout but retained the title. Audiences became increasingly hostile toward Maivia, with chants of \"die, Rocky, die\" and \"Rocky sucks\" being heard during his matches.[2][43]\n\n\nAfter losing the Intercontinental Championship to Owen Hart on the April 28, 1997, episode of *Raw Is War*,[74] Maivia suffered a legitimate knee injury in a match against Mankind in June 1997 and spent several months recovering.[2]\n\n\n\n#### Nation of Domination (1997–1998)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Nation of Domination\n\nUpon returning in August 1997, Maivia turned heel for the first time in his career by lashing out at fans who had been booing him and joining Faarooq, D'Lo Brown and Kama in the stable called the Nation of Domination.[75] He then refused to acknowledge the Rocky Maivia name, instead referring to himself in the third person as the Rock, though he would still be billed as \"The Rock\" Rocky Maivia until 1998. The Rock would then regularly insult the audience, WWF performers, and interviewers in his promos.[75]\n\n\nAt D-Generation X: In Your House on December 7, 1997, Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated the Rock in under six minutes to retain the Intercontinental Championship.[76] The next night on *Raw Is War*, Austin was ordered by Mr. McMahon to defend the title in a rematch, but forfeited it to the Rock instead, handing him the title belt before hitting him with the *Stone Cold Stunner*.[77][78] The Rock feuded with Austin and Ken Shamrock through the end of 1997 and beginning of 1998.[79][80] On January 19, 1998, at the Royal Rumble, the Rock defeated Shamrock by disqualification to retain the Intercontinental title. Later that night, he entered the Royal Rumble match and lasted until the final two before he was eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. On March 29, at WrestleMania XIV, he defeated Shamrock by disqualification once again to retain the title. The next night, on *Raw is War*, the Rock debuted a new Intercontinental Championship design and would later overthrow Faarooq as leader of the Nation of Domination to spark a feud between the two. He then successfully defended the Intercontinental title against Faarooq at Over the Edge: In Your House on May 31. The stable would then refer to themselves as simply \"The Nation\".[81]\n\n\nThe Rock and the Nation then feuded with Triple H and D-Generation X, with the two stable leaders first meeting in the quarter-final of the 1998 King of the Ring tournament, which the Rock won. At King of the Ring, the Rock defeated Dan Severn in the semi-final match and lost to rival Ken Shamrock in the final. The Rock then resumed his feud with Triple H, as the two had a two out of three falls match at Fully Loaded: In Your House for the Intercontinental title, which the Rock retained in controversial fashion.[82] This led to a ladder match at SummerSlam on August 30, 1998, where the Rock lost the title.[83]\n\n\nIn the latter half of 1998, The Rock saw a big uptick in fan support. He also started consolidating his famous persona during this time, which would last until 2000.[84] His popularity caused him to be booked in a feud with fellow Nation members Mark Henry and D'Lo Brown, turning babyface in the process. Henry defeated him at Judgment Day: In Your House on October 18, 1998, after interference from Brown, effectively breaking up the stable.[85][86]\n\n\n\n#### WWF Champion and rise to superstardom (1998–2000)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Corporation and Rock 'n' Sock Connection\n\n![](image)As part of The Corporation, the Rock feuded with Stone Cold Steve Austin and stole Austin's personalized WWF Championship and his \"Smoking Skull\" belt.\nThe Rock was then entered into the \"Deadly Game\" tournament for the vacant WWF Championship. The finals occurred at Survivor Series on November 15, 1998, where the Rock defeated Vince McMahon's associate, Mankind, to win his first WWF Championship.[87][88] A \"double turn\" then occurred as the Rock turned heel again after allying with Vince and Shane McMahon as the crown jewel of their stable, The Corporation, after the McMahons betrayed Mankind.[87][89] On December 13, 1998, at the pay-per-view named after him, Rock Bottom: In Your House, the Rock had a rematch with Mankind for the WWF Championship. Mankind appeared to win the match when the Rock passed out to the Mandible Claw submission move, but Vince McMahon ruled that since the Rock did not tap out, he retained his title.[89][90]\n\n\nIn the main event of the January 4, 1999, episode of *Raw Is War*, Mankind defeated the Rock for the championship after interference from Stone Cold Steve Austin.[91] Then at the Royal Rumble on January 24, 1999, the Rock regained the title in an \"I Quit\" match, a type of submission match that only ends if one of the combatants says \"I quit\" on a microphone. Intended to show a vicious streak in the Rock's character, the Rock hit Mankind in the head with a steel chair 11 times instead of the scripted five, five shots already being risky (most wrestling matches in the Attitude Era involving steel chairs had at most 2 or 3 shots to the head). After the fifth shot, Mankind was still ringside instead of two-thirds up the entrance ramp where he was supposed to be, and after the eleventh shot, which knocked Mankind out, a recording of Mankind saying \"I Quit\" from an earlier interview was played over the public address system.[92][93] On January 31, during an episode of *Sunday Night Heat*, the Rock and Mankind participated in an Empty Arena match, a match that took place in an arena with 22,000 empty seats where any part of the facility could be used to contest the match. After 20 minutes of chaotic brawling in the ring, the stands, a kitchen, the catering area, an office, the arena corridors and finally a basement loading area, Mankind pinned the Rock using a forklift truck to win the WWF title.[94] This match was referred to as \"Halftime Heat\" as it was televised during halftime of that year's Super Bowl.[95] The two faced off again, at St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House on February 14, 1999, in a Last Man Standing match which ended in a draw, meaning Mankind retained the title. Their feud ended on the February 15 *Raw Is War*, when the Rock won his third WWF Championship in a Ladder Match after a debuting Big Show interfered on his behalf.[96][97] The Rock then lost the WWF Championship to Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania XV on March 28, 1999.[98]\n\n\nThe Rock's popularity continued to grow and audiences still cheered for him even though he was a heel. He then lost the title rematch against Stone Cold Steve Austin at Backlash: In Your House on April 25, 1999.[99] The next night on *Raw is War* he was fired from the Corporation after he was betrayed by Shane McMahon, turning him face again and starting a feud with Triple H, The Undertaker and The Corporate Ministry. On April 29, 1999, WWF aired the pilot episode of *SmackDown!*, a term derived from one of the Rock's catchphrases. In the episode, the Rock continued his feud with The Corporate Ministry. This led to a match with Triple H, at Over the Edge on May 23, 1999, which the Rock won,[100] and a match for the WWF Championship against The Undertaker, at King of the Ring, which the Rock lost.[101] The Rock then lost a number one contender's match to Triple H, at Fully Loaded, after interference from \"Mr. Ass\" Billy Gunn.[102] The Rock then defeated Gunn in a Kiss My Ass match at SummerSlam on August 22, 1999. The Rock was also given the privilege of having his own signature match, like The Undertaker with the Buried Alive match, Kane with the Inferno Match and Mankind with the Boiler Room Brawl: the Brahma Bullrope match, a variant of a strap match was a normal singles match where the components are tied together with a rope used for cattle farming, and the rope and its attached cowbell could both be used as weapons. The Rock contested this match twice, both times in Texas (vs Triple H in Dallas, and vs Al Snow in Houston).[103]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock's popularity was fueled by his charisma and speaking abilities, which led to many catchphrases and merchandising opportunities.\nShortly after SummerSlam, the Rock began teaming with former opponent Mankind and the two became known as the Rock 'n' Sock Connection.[104] They became WWF Tag Team Champions for the first time after defeating The Undertaker and Big Show for the titles on the August 30, 1999, episode of *Raw is War*.[105][106] The two performed a number of critically acclaimed comedic skits together, including one called \"This Is Your Life\", which saw Mankind bring parody versions of people from the Rock's past on television, such as his high school girlfriend and his high school football coach, only to have the Rock insult them. The segment earned an 8.4 Nielsen rating, one of the highest ratings ever for a *Raw* segment.[107] The two lost the titles back to Undertaker and Big Show on the September 9 episode of *SmackDown!* and won them back from them on the September 20 episode of *Raw is War*.[108][109] Rock and Mankind then lost the titles to The New Age Outlaws on the very next episode of *SmackDown!*.[110] Rock and Mankind would win the tag titles for the third and final time after beating the New Age Outlaws on the October 14 episode of *SmackDown!* before losing the titles to The Holly Cousins on the October 18 episode of *Raw is War*.[111][112]\n\n\nAt the Royal Rumble, on January 23, 2000, the Rock entered the Royal Rumble match and was one of the final two remaining, along with Big Show. In an attempt at a \"false finish\", Big Show intended to throw the Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, before the Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before reentering the ring as the winner.[113] But the Rock's feet accidentally hit the floor during the reversal attempt, though those watching the event on television did not see that. This was played up in the storyline as Big Show provided additional video footage showing it and claimed to be the rightful winner. The Rock's number one contendership for the WWF Championship was then put on the line against Big Show at No Way Out on February 27, 2000, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered.[114] The Rock then defeated Big Show on the March 13 episode of *Raw Is War*, to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, in a Fatal Four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley.[115][116] Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife Stephanie, Foley had Linda, the Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane.[116][117] The Rock lasted until the final two but was eliminated by Triple H after Vince betrayed him by hitting him with a chair.[117][118]\n\n\nDue to his image at the time, a Magic: The Gathering deck archetype was named after him.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Record-breaking world champion (2000–2002)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock as the WWF Champion in 2000\nIn the following weeks, the Rock continued his feud with Triple H and eventually won his fourth WWF Championship, which he won on April 30, at Backlash, after Stone Cold Steve Austin intervened on his behalf.[120][121] The following night on *Raw*, he successfully defended his title against Shane McMahon in a Steel Cage match. On May 21, at Judgment Day, the Rock faced Triple H in an Iron Man match with Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee.[122] With the score tied at five falls each, and with seconds left on the time limit, the Rock was disqualified when The Undertaker attacked Triple H, thus giving Triple H the 6–5 win and the title.[122][123] The Rock won the WWF Championship for a fifth time at King of the Ring on June 25 by scoring the winning pin in a six-man tag team match, teaming with Kane and The Undertaker against Shane McMahon, Triple H and Vince McMahon, whom he pinned.[124][125] The Rock successfully defended the championship against Chris Benoit, on July 23, at Fully Loaded. The next month, he successfully defended his title against Kurt Angle and Triple H at SummerSlam. The Rock had another successful title defense against Benoit, Kane and The Undertaker, on September 24, at Unforgiven.[126]\n\n\nThe Rock then lost the WWF Championship to Kurt Angle, at No Mercy, on October 22, 2000.[127] The next month, the Rock feuded with Rikishi and defeated him at Survivor Series.[128] The Rock wrestled a six-man Hell in a Cell match for the WWF Championship, at Armageddon, which Angle won to retain the title.[129] On the December 18 episode of *Raw*, the Rock won the WWF Tag Team Championship with The Undertaker, defeating Edge and Christian, before losing it back to them the next night at a *SmackDown!* taping.[130] In 2001, the Rock continued to feud with Angle over the WWF Championship, culminating at No Way Out on February 25, 2001, where he pinned Angle to win the WWF Championship for a sixth time.[131][132] The Rock then feuded with the Royal Rumble winner, Stone Cold Steve Austin, whom he lost the title to at WrestleMania X-Seven after Austin allied with Vince McMahon, who interfered on his behalf.[133] On the next night's *Raw Is War*, during a steel cage title rematch, Triple H attacked the Rock, allying with McMahon and Austin and helping Austin retain the championship.[134] Austin and Triple H then formed a tag team called The Power Trip,[135] while the Rock was indefinitely suspended in storyline. Johnson used this time off to act in *The Scorpion King*.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock taunting an opponent at ringside at *WWF Raw*, October 2001\nThe Rock returned in late July 2001 when the WWF was feuding with rival promotions World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) during what is known as The Invasion storyline. In reality, WCW was purchased by Vince McMahon and the WWF, and ECW had gone out of business in early 2001. Many former WCW and ECW wrestlers were then brought onto WWF television and formed The Alliance to compete with WWF in storyline. The Alliance and Vince McMahon then both attempted to persuade the Rock to join their team. The Rock then aligned with McMahon and the WWF. The next month, the Rock defeated Booker T, at SummerSlam, to win the WCW Championship for the first time.[136][137] He later lost the title to Chris Jericho at No Mercy on October 21, 2001.[138][139] The next night on *Raw*, he teamed with Jericho to win the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Dudley Boyz. The two then lost the tag titles to Booker T and Test on the November 1, 2001, episode of *SmackDown!*.[140] The Rock defeated Jericho on the November 5 episode of *Raw* for his second WCW Championship.[141]\n\n\nAs part of the WWF's battle against The Alliance, the Rock wrestled in a \"winner takes all\" five-on-five elimination tag team match at Survivor Series where the losing team's company would be dissolved in storyline. He was a member of Team WWF along with Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and Big Show. The Alliance's team consisted of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Shane McMahon. In the end, it came down to a one-on-one between the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Rock seemed to have the upper hand, until his teammate Jericho entered the ring and attacked the Rock. Austin tried to capitalize on this by pinning the Rock, but Kurt Angle revealed his true allegiance by attacking Austin. The Rock then pinned Austin, giving Team WWF the victory and forcing The Alliance to disband. The Rock's WCW Championship was renamed the unbranded \"World Championship\" following the Alliance's loss.[142] At the next pay-per-view, Vengeance on December 9, 2001, the Rock lost the World Championship to Jericho, who would then unify the WWF and World titles later that night.[143] The Rock then unsuccessfully challenged Jericho for the now Undisputed WWF Championship at Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002.[144]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock doing his signature pose before wrestling Hulk Hogan (bottom right) at WrestleMania X8, March 2002\nAt the next pay-per-view, No Way Out on February 17, 2002, the Rock defeated The Undertaker in a singles match. The event also saw the WWF debut of the famed WCW faction New World Order, which at the time consisted of \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall.[145] This later led to a match between the Rock and Hogan at WrestleMania X8 on March 17, 2002. The match was billed as \"icon versus icon\", with both men representing the top tier of two generations of wrestling; ultimately the Rock pinned Hogan at WrestleMania X8 to win the match.[146] Despite the Rock portraying a heroic character and Hogan a villain, a portion of the crowd attending the SkyDome was rooting heavily for Hogan.[147][148] In an interview in 2013, Hogan said he and the Rock changed the style of the match on the fly based on the crowd's response.[149] After the introduction of the first-ever brand extension, the WWF held a \"draft lottery\" on the March 25, 2002, episode of *Raw*. The Rock was the number one overall pick, going to the SmackDown! brand before taking a sabbatical from wrestling.[150]\n\n\nThe Rock made a surprise return on a June episode of *Raw* before going to his assigned brand of SmackDown!. There, he was named the number one contender for the WWE Undisputed Championship, which he won for a record-setting seventh time at Vengeance, on July 21, by defeating Kurt Angle and then-champion The Undertaker in a Triple Threat match.[151][152] The Rock successfully defended the title at the Global Warning event against Triple H and Brock Lesnar after pinning Triple H.[153] On August 25, at SummerSlam, after interference from Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman, the Rock lost the WWE Undisputed Championship to Lesnar along with the record for the youngest WWE Champion, which he had set in 1998.[154] In 2018, writing for *ESPN.com*, Sean Coyle noted in a retrospective review of the event, that following his victory over Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania X8, the Rock \"started to see a dip in fan support\" and \"that dip turned into a plunge\" by the time Rock had his match with Lesnar at SummerSlam because fans knew he was leaving WWE to pursue an acting career,[155] as evidenced by the negative crowd response during his match with Lesnar.[156] After SummerSlam ended, the Rock was visibly angry at the crowd reaction. When he tried to do a post-show speech for the crowd, the fans booed him.[157] The Rock then took time off to kickstart his acting career.[158]\n\n\n\n#### Final feuds and departure (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\nThe Rock returned on the January 30, 2003, episode of *SmackDown!* to set up another match with Hulk Hogan at No Way Out.[159] Because of negative fan reaction during previous matches as a result of his budding acting career, The Rock turned heel for the first time since 1999. He also started a new persona that has been called *Hollywood Rock*, with a new look and a shaved head.[160][161] The Rock defeated Hogan at No Way Out before moving to the Raw brand.[162] There, he had various small feuds, including one with The Hurricane.[163] He also began performing \"Rock Concerts\", segments in which he played the guitar and mocked WWE performers and fans in song.[164]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin (left) in Austin's final match at WrestleMania XIX in March 2003.\nAfter failing to win a number one contendership for the World Heavyweight Championship, The Rock went into another program with Stone Cold Steve Austin. This led to a match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, 2003, which called back to their previous two WrestleMania encounters, both of which Austin had won.[165] The Rock won after delivering three consecutive *Rock Bottoms*, ending their long-running rivalry in what turned out to be Austin's final match.[2][166] The next night, *Raw* was billed as \"The Rock Appreciation Night\", in honor of his victory over Austin. That night, he was attacked by a debuting Goldberg.[167] At Backlash on April 27, 2003, Goldberg defeated The Rock, who then briefly left WWE to film *Walking Tall*.[2][168]\n\n\nDuring the rest of the year, The Rock made occasional appearances, returning to a face character.[169] In 2004, The Rock aided Mick Foley in his feud against Evolution,[3][2][170] leading to a reunion of the Rock 'n' Sock Connection. They lost against Ric Flair, Randy Orton, and Batista in a handicap match at WrestleMania XX on March 14, 2004, when Orton pinned Foley after an *RKO*.[2][171] This was Johnson's final wrestling match until November 2011. The Rock appeared in WWE sporadically following WrestleMania XX. He made returns to provide support for Eugene against Jonathan Coachman, and made a cameo in his hometown of Miami and helped Mick Foley against La Résistance.[2] Later in 2004, he hosted a pie-eating contest, as part of the WWE Diva Search, and ended the segment by giving Coachman a *People's Elbow*.[2] The Rock's contract with WWE then ended and he started his full-time acting career.[172]\n\n\n\n#### Non-wrestling appearances (2007–2009)[edit]\n\n\nOn March 12, 2007, the Rock appeared on a WWE show after nearly three years, via a pre-taped promo shown during *Raw*. He correctly predicted that Bobby Lashley would defeat Umaga at WrestleMania 23 in Donald Trump's and Vince McMahon's \"Battle of the Billionaires\" Hair vs. Hair match.[173] On March 29, 2008, Johnson inducted his father Rocky Johnson and grandfather Peter Maivia into the WWE Hall of Fame.[174] His next appearance was through a pre-taped promo on October 2, 2009, during the *Decade of SmackDown*.[175]\n\n\n\n### Independent circuit (2009)[edit]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2009, the Rock appeared at a World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) show to support the professional wrestling debut of Sarona Snuka, the daughter of his longtime friend and mentor Jimmy Snuka.[176]\n\n\n\n### Return to WWE[edit]\n\n\n#### Feud with John Cena (2011–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock in the ring as WrestleMania XXVII host, April 2011\nOn February 14, 2011, the Rock was announced as the host of WrestleMania XXVII on April 3, 2011, appearing live on *Raw* for the first time in almost seven years. During a lengthy promo, he addressed the fans and started a feud with John Cena.[177][178] After numerous appearances via satellite, the Rock appeared live on the *Raw* before WrestleMania XXVII to confront Cena. After he and Cena exchanged insults, The Miz and Alex Riley appeared and attacked the Rock; he fended off Miz and Riley, only for Cena to blindside him with an *Attitude Adjustment*.[179]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock and John Cena (left) on *Raw*, agreeing to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII one year in advance\nOn April 3, at WrestleMania XXVII, the Rock opened the show by cutting a promo. After appearing in numerous backstage segments, the Rock came to ringside to restart the main event between Cena and The Miz as a No Disqualification match, after it had ended in a draw. As revenge for the *Attitude Adjustment* Cena had given him on *Raw*, Rock hit Cena with the *Rock Bottom*, allowing The Miz to pin him and retain the WWE Championship. After the match, Rock attacked Miz and hit him with the *People's Elbow*.[180] The next night on *Raw*, the Rock and Cena agreed to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII the next year. They then worked together to fend off an attack by The Corre, which at the time consisted of Wade Barrett, Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel, and Ezekiel Jackson.[181]\n\n\nThe Rock appeared live on *Raw* in his hometown of Miami to celebrate his 39th birthday.[182] On September 16, WWE announced the Rock would wrestle in a traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series tag team match, teaming with Cena at Survivor Series in November.[183] But on the October 24 episode of *Raw*, Cena instead suggested the Rock be his partner in a standard tag team match against The Miz and R-Truth, a team called Awesome Truth,[184] which Rock agreed to the next week.[185] On November 14, during the special *Raw Gets Rocked*, the Rock appeared live, delivering *Rock Bottom*s to Mick Foley, who had been hosting a \"This Is Your Life\"-style segment for Cena, and later both members of Awesome Truth.[186] The Rock and Cena defeated Awesome Truth on November 20 at Survivor Series, when the Rock pinned The Miz. After the match, the Rock gave Cena a *Rock Bottom*.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock celebrating his victory at WrestleMania XXVIII, April 2012\nLeading up to WrestleMania, the Rock and Cena had several verbal confrontations on *Raw*.[188][189] On the March 12, 2012, episode of *Raw*, the Rock hosted his first \"Rock Concert\" segment since 2004, mocking Cena in his songs.[190] On April 1, at WrestleMania XXVIII, the Rock defeated Cena in the main event after countering Cena's attempt at a *People's Elbow* into a *Rock Bottom* and pinning Cena.[191] This event broke the record for biggest professional wrestling pay-per-view buyrate. The following night on *Raw*, the Rock praised Cena, calling their match \"an honor\". He then vowed to once again become WWE Champion.[192]\n\n\nOn July 23, at *Raw 1000*, the Rock announced he would wrestle for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view. During the show, he encountered then-reigning WWE Champion CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, and John Cena, all of whom expressed a desire to face him. The Rock later saved Cena from an assault by Big Show, only to be laid out by CM Punk.[193] On the January 7, 2013, episode of *Raw*, the Rock returned to confront his Royal Rumble opponent CM Punk.[194] On January 11, he made his first *SmackDown* appearance in ten years, getting into an altercation with Team Rhodes Scholars, resulting in him delivering a *Rock Bottom* to Damien Sandow and a *People's Elbow* to Cody Rhodes.[195] The Rock closed out the 20th-anniversary episode of *Raw*, on January 14, with one of his \"Rock Concerts\", leading to a brawl with CM Punk.[196] The following week on *Raw*, the Rock was attacked by The Shield. Vince McMahon then asserted that if The Shield attacked the Rock in his title match with CM Punk, Punk would be stripped of the WWE Championship.[197]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock revealing the brand new WWE Championship design on *WWE Raw*, February 2013\nOn January 27, at the Royal Rumble, CM Punk would seemingly defeat the Rock after the arena lights went out and someone attacked the Rock. Vince McMahon then came out and was about to strip Punk of the championship, however, at the Rock's request, he instead restarted the match. This culminated in the Rock defeating Punk to win his eighth WWE Championship.[198] Punk received a title rematch with the Rock, at Elimination Chamber on February 17, 2013, with the added stipulation that if the Rock was disqualified or counted out, he would still lose the WWE Championship. The Rock would pin Punk to defeat him and retain the championship.[199] The following night on *Raw*, the Rock unveiled a new WWE Championship design, with a different center plate and removable customizable side-plates which had his \"Brahma Bull\" logo.[200] The Rock then resumed his rivalry with John Cena, who won that year's Royal Rumble to set up a rematch of the previous WrestleMania match between the two at WrestleMania 29, only this time with the WWE Championship on the line.[201][202]\n\n\nOn April 7, at WrestleMania 29, Rock lost the WWE Championship to Cena, ending his reign at 70 days.[203] Despite being advertised for *Raw* after WrestleMania, where it was stated that the Rock was still entitled a rematch for the WWE Championship,[204] The Rock did not appear because of a real injury sustained during his match with Cena, in which his abdominal and adductor tendons tore from his pelvis.[205] Johnson underwent surgery on April 23 to reattach the torn tendons.[206]\n\n\n\n#### Sporadic appearances (2014–2023)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock (right) confronts Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania XXX, April 2014.\n![](image)The Wyatt Family confronting The Rock at WrestleMania 32, April 2016\nIn April 2014, the Rock appeared in the opening segment of WrestleMania XXX along with Stone Cold Steve Austin and Hulk Hogan.[207] On the October 6 episode of *Raw*, the Rock made a surprise appearance to confront Rusev and Lana; this resulted in the Rock clearing Rusev from the ring.[208]\n\n\nThe Rock appeared at the 2015 Royal Rumble event on January 25, 2015, during the main event match, where he helped his relative Roman Reigns fend off Big Show and Kane after Reigns eliminated them from the match. Reigns then won the match and the Rock endorsed him in the ring.[209][210][211] The Rock appeared at WrestleMania 31 on March 29, 2015, alongside Ronda Rousey, getting into an in-ring altercation with Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. Rock and Rousey prevailed after he attacked Triple H and she overpowered McMahon.[212] On June 27, the Rock appeared at a live event in Boston, where he confronted Bo Dallas and gave him a *Rock Bottom*.[213]\n\n\nOn the January 25, 2016, episode of *Raw*, the Rock was in a segment that saw him converse with The Miz, Big Show, Lana and Rusev before he and his relatives, The Usos, got into an altercation with then-WWE Tag Team Champions, The New Day.[214] The Rock appeared at WrestleMania 32 on April 3, 2016, where he announced that WWE had broken the all-time WrestleMania attendance record before being interrupted by The Wyatt Family. The Rock got into a verbal back-and-forth with Bray Wyatt before having an impromptu match with Wyatt Family member Erick Rowan. The Rock won after giving Rowan a *Rock Bottom* and pinning him in six seconds, which set the record for the fastest win in WrestleMania history. The Rock was then aided by a returning John Cena to fend off Wyatt, Rowan and Braun Strowman.[215] On the February 20, 2017, episode of *Raw*, the Rock made an untelevised appearance after the broadcast had gone off the air, where he promoted and filmed a scene for his then-upcoming film *Fighting with My Family*.[216]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2019, the Rock officially announced his retirement from professional wrestling.[217] On September 30, 2019, after weeks of speculation, the Rock announced that he would appear on *SmackDown*'s 20th Anniversary on October 4, 2019, marking his first appearance on SmackDown since October 2014 and his first televised appearance since April 2016.[218] At the event, he cut a promo with Becky Lynch before they were interrupted by King Corbin. After attacking Corbin, the Rock and Lynch celebrated in the ring.[219]\n\n\nOn September 15, 2023, the Rock made a surprise return to SmackDown to take out Austin Theory. This marks his first televised appearance on WWE since October 4, 2019.[220]\n\n\n\n### Impact Wrestling (2020)[edit]\n\n\nThe Rock made an appearance at Impact Wrestling's 2020 Bound for Glory on October 20, 2020, in Nashville via a recorded video message to induct Ken Shamrock into the Impact Hall of Fame.[221][222]\n\n\n\n### Mainstream crossover[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock in a 2001 *Vanity Fair* photo shoot\nThe Rock appeared on Wyclef Jean's 2000 single \"It Doesn't Matter\" and in its music video.[223][224] He also recorded \"Pie\" with Slick Rick for *WWF The Music, Vol. 5*.[225]\n\n\nIn 1999, Johnson appeared on *That '70s Show* as his father Rocky Johnson. The next year, he was on *Star Trek: Voyager* as an alien wrestler who used the Rock's moves.[226]\n\n\nIn 2000, he hosted *Saturday Night Live* (SNL) for the first time.[227] Fellow wrestlers Triple H, Big Show, and Mick Foley also appeared on the show.[3][228] Johnson has said the success of that episode is the reason he began receiving offers from Hollywood studios.[229] He has since hosted SNL four more times.\n\n\nIn 1999, the Rock was listed No. 5 on *Entertainment Weekly*'s Top 12 Entertainers of the Year.[230] In 2000, *Access Hollywood* ranked him number six in their list of the Top 10 Celebrities of 2000.[231] That year, Rock was also listed in the Forbes Celebrity 100 and *People* Magazine's 25 Most Intriguing People.[232][233]\n\n\nThe Rock was listed on *Entertainment Weekly*'s 101 Most Influential People in both 2000 and 2001.[234] In 2001, he was also listed on E!'s 20 Top Entertainers.[235][236] In 2002, the Rock was listed on E!'s 25 Toughest Stars.[237] In 2003, he was listed in VH1's 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons[238] and was No. 13 in *People* Magazine's 50 Favorite TV Stars.[239]\n\n\nThe Rock made a surprise appearance at the official Xbox unveiling during Bill Gates's keynote speech at the ongoing Computer Electronics Show in 2001.[240]\n\n\nJohnson's motion picture debut was as The Scorpion King in *The Mummy Returns* (2001).[241] The movie broke a two-year record for the highest-grossing single day in film history by earning $28,594,667.[242][3][227] The movie's financial success led to Johnson's first leading role in the spin-off *The Scorpion King* (2002).[3] He received $5.5 million for the role and *Guinness World Records* named him the record-holder for highest-paid actor in their first leading role.[243][244]\n\n\nThe Rock has appeared on the covers of many magazines, including *Rolling Stone*, *Entertainment Weekly*, and *TV Guide*.[245][246][247] He has also appeared in, and been the cover athlete for, several video games.[248]\n\n\nAs of November 2021[update], his Instagram account is the fourth most-followed in the world, with over 280 million followers.[249]\n\n\n\n### Legacy and career assessment[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **possibly contains original research**. Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations. Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. *(October 2021)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe Rock has been listed as one of the all-time greatest professional wrestlers[15][6][7] as well as one of the top draws in wrestling history. Many have placed the Rock on their \"Mount Rushmore of Pro Wrestling\", including Hulk Hogan,[250] Ric Flair,[251] and John Cena.[252] In \"Cable Visions: Television Beyond Broadcasting\", the Rock was described as \"for a long time, the WWE's biggest star and probably held the greatest international appeal\".[253] R. D. Reynolds stated in his book \"The WrestleCrap Book of Lists\" that the Rock was \"the biggest star for WWE from 1999 until 2004\".[254]\n\n\nThe Rock's \"I quit\" match with Mankind at the 1999 Royal Rumble event is infamous for its brutality and one of the most popular \"I quit\" match of all times.[255][256][257][258]\n\n\nThe Rock main-evented the most bought pay-per-view worldwide in WWE history (WrestleMania XXVIII),[259] the most bought pay-per-view domestically in WWE history (WrestleMania X-Seven), the highest rated *Raw* in history,[260][261] the highest rated *SmackDown* in history,[262] and was part of the highest rated cable segment in WWE history with Mankind entitled \"This is Your Life\", in which Mankind would honor The Rock with various gifts and reunions.[263][264] His return in 2001 had a 7.1 rating, the highest-rated segment of the year. The Rock was also part of the highest-rated match of the 21st century when his WWF Championship defense against Shane McMahon, on May 1, 2000, got an 8.3 rating, making it the highest-rated segment of all time, behind \"This Is Your Life\".\n\n\nIn 2011, the Rock's return to an episode of *Raw* generated an average of 4.7 million viewers in the United States, with 7.4 million tuning in during his promo.[265] *Raw 1000* was the highest rated *Raw* episode of 2012 and his segment with CM Punk and Daniel Bryan was the highest rated segment of the show.[266] In 2013, the night after the Rock won the WWE Championship for the first time in over a decade, at Royal Rumble, *Raw* got its highest rating of that year.[267]\n\n\nDerived from one of his catchphrases \"lay the smackdown\", in 1999 WWE introduced its second flagship program, *WWE SmackDown*, which became television's second longest-running weekly episodic program in history.[268] The term \"smackdown\" was included in Merriam-Webster dictionaries in 2007.[269][270] He is also known for popularizing the term \"jabroni\", derived from \"jobber\", although it was originally introduced by The Iron Sheik.[271][272]\n\n\nThe Rock holds the record for most *Raw* shows main-evented in one year (38 in 2000),[273] most *SmackDown* shows main-evented in one year (36 in 2000)[274] and tied with Stone Cold Steve Austin (in 2001)[275] for most PPV shows main evented in one year (12 in 2000).[276]\n\n\nAt the 2021 Survivor Series, WWE held a 25-man Battle Royal to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of The Rock's WWE debut. The match was won by Omos.[277]\n\n\n\n## Acting career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Johnson in April 2009\n### Career beginnings (2001–2010)[edit]\n\n\nJohnson entered Hollywood and the film industry, becoming a star initially through his wrestling popularity and noted work ethic. Over his acting career, he became one of the highest-paid and most successful actors in Hollywood.[278][279][280][281] He began his acting career on television while wrestling. In his first television acting job, in 1999, he played his father in an episode of *That '70s Show* called \"That Wrestling Show\". Nearly a year later, he appeared in the *Star Trek: Voyager* episode \"Tsunkatse\" as an alien wrestler who fought popular character Seven of Nine. While Johnson was away from WWE, the company continued to sell \"The Rock\" merchandise, and he continued to be featured prominently in the opening montages of their television shows.[35]\n\n\nJohnson began his film career in earnest with roles in *The Mummy Returns* (2001), *The Scorpion King* (2002), *The Rundown* (2003), and *Walking Tall* (2004).

He became known for reinvigorating film franchises after portraying Marvin F. Hinton / Roadblock in *G.I. Joe: Retaliation* and reprising his role as Luke Hobbs in *Fast & Furious 6* (2013),[284][285] while also starring in true-story films *Pain & Gain* (2013) and *Empire State* (2013). That same year, he hosted and produced the TNT reality competition series *The Hero*,[286][287] and won the Favorite Male Buttkicker Award at the 2013 Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Awards.[288] In May 2013, it was announced that he would executive produce and star in *Ballers*,[289] an HBO comedy-drama series about NFL players living in Miami.[290] By December of that year, *Forbes* named him the top-grossing actor of 2013, with his films bringing in $1.3 billion worldwide for the year. *Forbes* credited the success of *Fast & Furious 6*, which grossed $789 million globally, and his frequent acting work as primary reasons for topping the list.[291]\n\n\nJohnson starred as the title character in *Hercules* (2014)[292] and reprised his role as Luke Hobbs in *Furious 7* (2015).[293] He hosted another reality series for TNT in 2014, entitled *Wake Up Call*, which saw him \"lending a helping hand to everyday people who were facing enormous challenges in their lives\" alongside guest experts such as Rocco DiSpirito, Jillian Michaels, and Josh Shipp.[294] In 2016, Johnson co-starred with Kevin Hart in the action-comedy *Central Intelligence* and had a lead voice role in the Disney animated film *Moana*, in which he voiced the Polynesian demigod Maui. He reprised his role as Luke Hobbs in *The Fate of the Furious*, which was released in 2017. Johnson starred in two other blockbuster movies that year, *Baywatch* and *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* as Mitchell \"Mitch\" Buchannon and Dr. Smolder Bravestone, respectively.[295][296] In 2018, he starred in the action films *Rampage* and *Skyscraper*.\n\n\n\n![](image)Johnson's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in July 2022\nJohnson's role within the *Fast & Furious* franchise continued with *Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw*, starring alongside co-star Jason Statham. David Leitch directed the project from a script co-written by franchise-writer Chris Morgan and Drew Pearce. The film began principal photography in September 2018, and was released on July 26, 2019. Johnson will reprise his role in *Hobbs & Shaw 2* after not appearing in *F9* and also not returning in *Fast X* or *Fast & Furious 11*.[297][298] In May 2023, it was reported that he would make a cameo appearance during a post-credits scene of *Fast X*.[299] Johnson reprised his role as Bravestone, in *Jumanji: The Next Level*. With the critical and financial success of *Welcome to the Jungle*, production of the movie began in early 2019, and it was released on December 13, 2019.[300]\n\n\n\n### Career expansion (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Johnson co-starred with Emily Blunt in Disney's *Jungle Cruise* as Frank Wolff. The film is based on the theme-park ride of the same name.[301] Jaume Collet-Serra directed, with a script by Michael Green from a previous one by J. D. Payne and Patrick McKay.[302][303][304][305][306] In addition to his work on the film, Johnson assisted with re-designing the titular ride for all Disney theme parks.[307] *Jungle Cruise* was released on July 30, 2021.[308][309][310] Also in 2021, Johnson starred in Netflix's film *Red Notice*, written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber. It is the third time that the two collaborated, after *Central Intelligence* and *Skyscraper*.[311][312] It co-stars Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds.[313]\n\n\nJohnson is noted for his busy schedule and developing multiple projects at once.[314][315] A sequel to the box-office hit *San Andreas* was announced to be in the pre-production stage with the director of the first film, Brad Peyton, returning as director along with the main cast (marking the fourth collaboration between the two following *Journey 2*, *San Andreas*, and *Rampage*).[316][296]\n\n\nOn November 14, 2019, he announced a December 2021 release date for the standalone *Black Adam* film.[317] Production on *Black Adam* began filming in April 2021 with it set to release on October 21, 2022.[318][319] He earned $22.5 million to star in the film and received millions more for producing and promoting it on social media.[320]\n\n\nJohnson has been a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in the Actor's Branch since 2017.[321]\n\n\nOn March 16, 2021, he appeared for the first time as The Foundation in Fortnite Battle Royale. Johnson was initially uncredited in his role, yet teased his involvement in a cryptic Instagram post shared on the day of the event. Following another Instagram video for Johnson's ZOA Energy drink, in which The Foundation's helmet and sidearm were subtly featured in the background, his involvement was finally confirmed during the Chapter 2 End Event on December 4, 2021, with The Foundation removing his helmet to reveal that he shared Johnson's voice and likeness.[322]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Johnson reprised his role as Luke Hobbs in a cameo appearance during the mid-credits scene of *Fast X*.\n\n\n\n## Producer[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Johnson founded his production company Seven Bucks Productions.[24]\n\n\nThough originally attached as producer and star, Johnson will now serve solely as the former on a film adaptation of *The Janson Directive*. John Cena will fill the leading role, with Akiva Goldsman attached as screenwriter.[323] Additionally, he will produce and star in a Netflix exclusive film titled *John Henry & The Statesmen*, as the titular folklore hero. The film will be directed by Jake Kasdan, from a script by Kasdan and Tom Wheeler. With the first official teaser trailer released in October 2018, the project marks Kasdan's and Johnson's third collaboration, after *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* and *Jumanji: The Next Level*.[324]\n\n\nIn 2019, Johnson produced and appeared as himself in *Fighting with My Family*, a comedy drama about Paige and her family, who are also professional wrestlers.[325][326]\n\n\nJohnson will co-produce and star in *The King*, a film about king Kamehameha Kūnuiākea, founder and first ruler of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. The project will be directed by Robert Zemeckis from a script by Randall Wallace. The movie will be comparable to *Braveheart* in tone, given Wallace's work on both films, and will depict the king's role in resolving the wars among the islands of Hawaiʻi. *The King* was scheduled to begin production in 2020, but was halted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[327] Johnson is also attached to produce/star in a sequel to *Big Trouble in Little China*,[328][329] as well as project under development with Shane Black focusing on a new interpretation of Doc Savage.[330]\n\n\nIn 2021, his biographical comedy-drama series *Young Rock* began airing on NBC.[331]\n\n\nA film centered around Teth-Adam/Black Adam, a part of the DC Extended Universe, was announced to be in development in January 2017. Originally cast in the role as early as September 2014 as the antagonist, in a film centered around the superhero Billy Batson/Shazam,[332][333] his villainous role for *Shazam!* was reworked into two separate films.[334] Johnson did not appear in *Shazam!*, but he served as a producer and his likeness was used through special effects in flashback scenes.[335][336]\n\n\n\n## Other work[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, Johnson published his autobiography, *The Rock Says...*, co-written with Joe Layden. It debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list and remained on the list for several weeks.[22]\n\n\nIn 2013, Johnson hosted and produced the TNT reality competition series *The Hero*.[286][337] In 2014, he hosted another TNT reality series, *Wake Up Call*.[294] In 2019, Johnson started hosting the NBC competition series *The Titan Games*.[338]\n\n\nIn March 2016, Johnson partnered with American fitness apparel manufacturer Under Armour to release \"Project Rock\".[339] The first item in his partnership with Under Armour, a gym bag, sold out in a couple of days.[340][341] His second item, a black T-shirt sporting his signature \"Brahma bull\", sold out after being worn at WrestleMania 32.[342] Johnson also released an alarm clock app as part of \"Project Rock\" that received more than one million downloads in its first week of release.[343] Since then, they have released sneakers, headphones, and other apparel.[344]\n\n\nIn 2016, Johnson started his YouTube channel. His first video, *The YouTube Factory*, featured online personality Lilly Singh and several other internet stars.[345]\n\n\nIn 2019, Johnson announced he would launch a competitive bodybuilding show, \"Athleticon\", with his business partner and ex-wife Dany Garcia. It is set to rival other long-standing bodybuilding shows such as The Arnold Classic and Joe Weider's Mr. Olympia.[346] The show was set to debut in October 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia, but plans were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[346]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Johnson launched Teremana Tequila which sold 600,000 nine-litre cases in its first year.[347]\n\n\nA fan of the rapper Tech N9ne,[348] Johnson is featured on the song \"Face Off\" from the rapper's 2021 album *Asin9ne*.[349]\n\n\n\n## Activism and philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nJohnson attended the 2000 Democratic National Convention[350] as part of WWE's non-partisan \"Smackdown Your Vote\" campaign, which aimed to influence young people to vote.[351] He also had a speaking role at the 2000 Republican National Convention.[352]\n\n\nJohnson voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections.[245] He did not vote in the 2016 election,[353] and is an independent voter as of 2017[update].[354] He endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.[355] Johnson has expressed interest in running for president himself, telling *USA Today* in February 2021, \"I would consider a presidential run in the future if that's what the people wanted\".[356] Following an online public opinion poll that found that 46% of Americans would consider voting for Johnson in a presidential election, he said in an April 12, 2021, interview on *The Today Show*, \"I do have that goal to unite our country and I also feel that if this is what the people want, then I will do that\".[357]\n\n\nIn 2006, Johnson founded the Dwayne Johnson Rock Foundation, a charity working with at-risk and terminally ill children.[358] On October 2, 2007, he and his then wife, Dany Garcia, donated $1 million to the University of Miami to support the renovation of its football facilities. The university renamed the Hurricanes' locker room in Johnson's honor.[359] In 2015, Johnson donated $1,500 to a GoFundMe to pay for an abandoned dog's surgery.[360] In 2017, he donated $25,000 to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts.[361] In 2018, Johnson donated a gym to a military base in Oahu, Hawaii.[362] After the 2018 Hawaii floods, he worked with Malama Kauai, a nonprofit organization, to help repair flood damage.[363] Johnson has also worked with Make-A-Wish Foundation on a number of occasions.[364]\n\n\nIn July 2023, Johnson made a seven-figure donation to the SAG-AFTRA Foundation during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, which foundation president Courtney B. Vance cited to be \"the largest single donation that (the foundation) has ever received from one individual at one time\".[365]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nJohnson first met fellow University of Miami student Dany Garcia in the early 1990s. They married on May 3, 1997. She is a businesswoman, IFBB professional bodybuilder, and producer.[366] Their daughter, Simone, was born on August 14, 2001.[366][367] On June 1, 2007, Johnson and Garcia announced they were separating amicably,[366] and their divorce was finalized in May 2008.[368]\n\n\nIn 2007, Johnson began dating Lauren Hashian, the daughter of Boston drummer Sib Hashian.[369] They first met in 2006 while Johnson was filming *The Game Plan*.[370] They were married on August 18, 2019, in Hawaii.[371][372][373] They have two daughters.[374][375] Johnson and Hashian live in Los Angeles, also maintaining a farm in Virginia[376] and a home in Southwest Ranches, Florida.[377][378]\n\n\nIn recognition of his service to the Samoan people, and because he is a descendant of Samoan chiefs, Johnson was given the noble title *Seiuli* (meaning the son of Malietoa [*Alo o Malietoa*]) by Malietoa Tanumafili II during his visit there on August 9, 2004.[379] In 2009, he gained Canadian citizenship through his father's birth and citizenship there.[380] He got a partial Samoan pe'a tattoo on his left side in 2003.[381] In 2017, he had the small \"Brahma bull\" tattoo on his right arm covered with a larger half-sleeve tattoo of a bull's skull.[382]\n\n\nIn February 2020, WWE announced that Johnson's daughter Simone had started training at the WWE Performance Center,[383] making her the first fourth-generation WWE wrestler.[384] On May 16, Johnson announced she had signed a contract with WWE,[385] and in May 2022 announced that her ring name would be Ava Raine. She has since been appearing on the NXT brand.[386]\n\n\nJohnson is a supporter of the Samoa national rugby league team, and publicly pledged his support to the team during the 2021 Rugby League World Cup where they made the Final for the first time.[387][388]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Singles[edit]\n\n\n#### As lead artist[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of singles as lead artist, with selected chart positions\n| Title\n | Year\n | Peak chart positions\n | Certifications | Album\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US[389] | CAN[390] |\n| \"You're Welcome\"\n | 2016\n | 83 | 85\n | * RIAA: 6× Platinum[391]\n* BPI: Platinum[392]\n | *Moana: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack* |\n\n\n#### As featured artist[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of singles as lead artist, with selected chart positions\n| Title\n | Year\n | Peak chart positions\n | Album\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US[393] | USR&B/HH[394] | CAN[395] |\n| \"It Doesn't Matter\"(Wyclef Jean featuring the Rock and Melky Sedeck) | 2000\n | — | 80 | —[A] | *The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II a Book* |\n| \"Face Off\"(Tech N9ne featuring Joey Cool, King Iso, and Dwayne Johnson)[397] | 2021\n | —[B] | 45 | 77\n | *Asin9ne* |\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dwayne Johnson filmography\n\n## Championships and accomplishments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock in Nashville during his eighth and final WWE Championship reign, February 2013\n![](image)The Rock at *Mayhem in Manchester* in Manchester, England during one of his two Intercontinental Championship reigns, April 1998\n* ***Pro Wrestling Illustrated***\n\t+ Match of the Year (1999) vs. Mankind in an \"I Quit\" match at Royal Rumble[399][400]\n\t+ Match of the Year (2002) vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania X8[399][400]\n\t+ Most Popular Wrestler of the Year (1999, 2000)[399]\n\t+ Wrestler of the Year (2000)[399]\n\t+ Ranked No. 2 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the *PWI 500* in 2000[401]\n* **United States Wrestling Association**\n\t+ USWA World Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with Bart Sawyer[402]\n* ***Wrestling Observer Newsletter***\n\t+ Best Box Office Draw (2000, 2011, 2012)[403][404][405]\n\t+ Best Gimmick (1999)[403]\n\t+ Best on Interviews (1999, 2000)[403]\n\t+ Most Charismatic (1999–2002, 2011, 2012)[403][404][405]\n\t+ Most Improved (1998)[403]\n\t+ Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame (Class of 2007)[406]\n* **WWE/World Wrestling Entertainment/Federation**\n\t+ WWE Championship[a] (8 times)[407][408]\n\t+ WCW Championship[b] (2 times)[409][410]\n\t+ WWF Intercontinental Championship (2 times)[411]\n\t+ WWF Tag Team Championship (5 times) – with Mankind (3), The Undertaker (1), and Chris Jericho (1)[412]\n\t+ Royal Rumble (2000)[3]\n\t+ Sixth Triple Crown Champion[413]\n\t+ Deadly Games WWF Championship Tournament (1998)[414]\n\t+ Slammy Award (9 times)\n\t\t- Best Actor (2014)[415]\n\t\t- Game Changer of the Year (2011) – with John Cena[416]\n\t\t- Guess Who's Back or: Return of the Year (2011)[417]\n\t\t- LOL!

Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time,[6][7] he was integral to the development and success of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) during the Attitude Era, an industry boom period in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Johnson wrestled for the WWF for eight years before pursuing an acting career. His films have grossed over $3.5 billion in North America and over $10.5 billion worldwide,[8] making him one of the world's highest-grossing and highest-paid actors.[9][10][11]\n\n\nAfter accepting an athletic scholarship to play football at the University of Miami, he was a member of the 1991 national championship team, but was largely a backup player.[12] Despite aspirations to professional football, he went undrafted in the 1995 NFL draft, and briefly signed with the Calgary Stampeders before being cut in his first season.[13] In 1996, Johnson's father Rocky assisted in helping him secure a contract with the WWF.[2] Johnson quickly rose to global prominence, aided by a gimmick he employed as a charismatic trash talker. Johnson left the WWE in 2004 and returned in 2011 as a part-time performer until 2013, making sporadic appearances until retiring in 2019.[14] A 10-time world champion, including the promotion's first of African-American descent,[15] he is also a two-time Intercontinental Champion, a five-time Tag Team Champion, the 2000 Royal Rumble winner, and WWE's sixth Triple Crown champion. Johnson headlined the most-bought professional wrestling pay-per-view (WrestleMania XXVIII) and was featured among the most watched episodes of WWE's flagship television series (*Raw* and *SmackDown*).[16][17]\n\n\nJohnson's first film role was in *The Mummy Returns* (2001). The next year, he played his first leading role in the action fantasy film *The Scorpion King*. He has since starred in family films *The Game Plan* (2007), *Race to Witch Mountain* (2009), *Tooth Fairy* (2010), *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* (2017), *Jumanji: The Next Level* (2019), and *Jungle Cruise* (2021), and the action films *Journey 2: The Mysterious Island* (2012), *G.I. Joe: Retaliation* (2013), *Hercules* (2014), *Skyscraper* (2018), *San Andreas* (2015) and *Rampage* (2018). He also starred in the action comedy films *Get Smart* (2008), *Central Intelligence* (2016), *Baywatch* (2017), and *Red Notice* (2021). His role as Luke Hobbs in the *Fast & Furious* films, beginning with *Fast Five* (2011), helped the franchise become one of the highest-grossing in film.[18] He joined the DC Extended Universe playing the title role in *Black Adam* (2022).[19] He is also known for voicing Maui in the Disney animated film *Moana* (2016) and is set to reprise the role in the upcoming live action remake.[20]\n\n\nJohnson produced and starred in the HBO comedy-drama series *Ballers* (2015–2019)[21] and the autobiographical sitcom *Young Rock* (2021). His autobiography, *The Rock Says*, was released in 2000 and was a *New York Times* bestseller.[22][23] In 2012, he co-founded the entertainment production company Seven Bucks Productions.[24] Johnson is a co-owner of the XFL, a professional American football league, which he acquired from WWE owner Vince McMahon for $15 million in 2020.[25][26][27] In 2016 and 2019, *Time* named Johnson one of the world's most influential people.[28][29]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJohnson was born in Hayward, California,[30] on May 2, 1972,[31] the son of Ata Johnson (née Maivia)[32] and former professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles).[33][34] Growing up, he briefly lived in Grey Lynn in Auckland, New Zealand, with his mother's family,[35] where he played rugby[36] and attended Richmond Road Primary School before returning to the U.S.[35]\n\n\nJohnson's father was a Black Nova Scotian with a small amount of Irish ancestry.[37][38] His mother is Samoan. His father and Tony Atlas were the first black tag team champions in WWE history, in 1983.[39][40] His mother is the adopted daughter of Peter Maivia, who was also a professional wrestler.[41] Johnson's maternal grandmother Lia was one of the first female pro wrestling promoters, taking over Polynesian Pacific Pro Wrestling after her husband's death in 1982 and managing it until 1988.[42][43] Through his maternal grandfather Maivia, Johnson is a non-blood relative of the Anoa'i wrestling family.[44][45][46][47][48] In 2008, he inducted his father and grandfather into the WWE Hall of Fame.[49]\n\n\nJohnson attended Montclaire Elementary School in Charlotte, North Carolina, before moving to Hamden, Connecticut, where he attended Shepherd Glen Elementary School and then Hamden Middle School.[50][51] He attended President William McKinley High School in Honolulu and then Glencliff High School and McGavock High School, both in Nashville, and then Freedom High School in Bethlehem Township in the Lehigh Valley, from which he graduated in 1990.[52]\n\n\nAt Freedom High School, Johnson initially struggled and was drawn into a culture of conflict and petty crime. By age 17, he had been arrested several times for fighting, theft, and check fraud, and was suspended two weeks for fighting.[53] The local newspaper later called him \"a troubled teenager with a history of run-ins with police.\" But Freedom High School football coach Jody Cwik saw athletic potential in Johnson, and recruited him to join the football team, where he played defensive tackle. The experience proved the beginning of a personal transformation for Johnson. \"My thought process started to change. That's when I started thinking about goals and what I wanted to accomplish\", he has since said about his high school football experience.[12] In addition to playing football, Johnson also was a member of Freedom High School's track and field and wrestling teams. [33]\n\n\nBy his senior year, Johnson had played only two years of football, but was offered a full athletic scholarship offer from the University of Miami.[12]\n\n\n\n## Football career[edit]\n\n\n### College career[edit]\n\n\n\n\nDwayne Johnson| No. 94 |\n| --- |\n| Position | Defensive tackle |\n| Major | Criminology and physiology |\n| Personal information |\n| Born: | May 2, 1972 (1972-05-02) (age 52)Hayward, California, U.S. |\n| Height | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) |\n| Weight | 253 lb (115 kg) |\n| Career history |\n| College | * Miami (FL) (1990–1994)\n |\n| Bowl games | * Cotton Bowl Classic (1991)\n* Orange Bowl (1992)\n |\n| High school | Freedom High School(Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) |\n| Career highlights and awards |\n| * AP Poll national champion (1991)\n |\n\n\nAs he did in high school, Johnson continued to play defensive tackle at the University of Miami. He was a member of the Miami Hurricanes football team during his freshman year in 1991, and won that year's national championship.[54][33] Despite playing four years there, Johnson found himself behind elite players on the depth chart, including future NFL star and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Warren Sapp, and appeared mostly in backup roles.[55][56] In his time at Miami, Johnson played in 39 games with one start. He recorded 4.25 sacks and 77 tackles.[57]\n\n\nIn 1995, Johnson graduated with a Bachelor of General Studies and a dual major in criminology and physiology.[58] He was also one of the university's most prolific student speakers in the Miami-area community, frequently delivering positive messages about his own struggles and encouraging students to remain in school and avoid the dangers of drug use.[59]\n\n\n\n### Canadian Football League[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating, Johnson was signed by the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. Calgary moved him from defensive tackle to linebacker. He was assigned to Calgary's practice roster, but was cut two months into Calgary's 1995 season.[33][60][61]\n\n\n\n## Professional wrestling career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career (1996)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on |\n| Professional wrestling |\n| ![](image) |\n| History\n* History of professional wrestling\n\t+ By year\n* Early wrestling championships\n* Gold Dust Trio\n* 1980s boom\n* Black Saturday\n* 1994 NWA World Title Tournament\n* Monday Night Wars\n* Attitude Era\n* 2000 All Japan Pro Wrestling mass exodus\n* The Invasion\n* Wednesday Night Wars\n |\n| Notable promotions\n* All Elite Wrestling\n* All Japan Pro Wrestling\n* All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling\n* American Wrestling Association\n* Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\n* Extreme Championship Wrestling\n* Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling\n* Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling\n* Jim Crockett Promotions\n* Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide\n* National Wrestling Alliance\n* New Japan Pro-Wrestling\n* Pro Wrestling Noah\n* Ring of Honor\n* Tokyo Joshi Pro-Wrestling\n* Total Nonstop Action Wrestling\n* UWF International\n* Women of Wrestling\n* World Championship Wrestling\n* World Wonder Ring Stardom\n* WWE\n* Others\n |\n| Notable people\n**Early 20th Century**\n* George Hackenschmidt\n* The Great Gama\n* Frank Gotch\n* Billy Sandow\n* Toots Mondt\n* Ed Lewis\n* Jack Pfefer\n* Jim Londos\n* Salvador Lutteroth\n* Lou Thesz\n\n\n**Mid 20th Century**\n\n* Gorgeous George\n* El Santo\n* Sam Muchnick\n* Mildred Burke\n* The Fabulous Moolah\n* Blue Demon\n* Verne Gagne\n* Karl Gotch\n* Rikidōzan\n* Stu Hart\n* Bruno Sammartino\n\n\n**1970s and 1980s**\n\n* Terry Funk\n* Harley Race\n* Gordon Solie\n* Antonio Inoki\n* Giant Baba\n* Mil Máscaras\n* André the Giant\n* Carlos Colón\n* Dusty Rhodes\n* Ric Flair\n* Jim Crockett Jr.\n* Big Daddy\n* Vince McMahon\n* Dynamite Kid\n* Satoru \"Tiger Mask\" Sayama\n* Hulk Hogan\n* Randy Savage\n* Hisashi Shinma\n* Akira Maeda\n\n\n**1990s**\n\n* Ted Turner\n* Sting\n* The Great Muta\n* The Undertaker\n* Jim Ross\n* Mitsuharu Misawa\n* Kenta Kobashi\n* Toshiaki Kawada\n* Atsushi Onita\n* Antonio Peña\n* Eric Bischoff\n* Paul Heyman\n* Jim Cornette\n* Bret Hart\n* Shawn Michaels\n* Kevin Nash\n* Scott Hall\n* Vince Russo\n* Stone Cold Steve Austin\n* The Rock\n* Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque\n\n\n**2000s**\n\n* Chris Jericho\n* Jeff Jarrett\n* Eddie Guerrero\n* Rey Mysterio\n* Brock Lesnar\n* John Cena\n* Hiroshi Tanahashi\n* Místico\n\n\n**2010s and 2020s**\n\n* CM Punk\n* Bryan Danielson\n* Roman Reigns\n* Kazuchika Okada\n* Kenny Omega\n* Tony Khan\n* Nick Khan\n* Cody Rhodes\n |\n| By region\n* Australia\n* Bolivia\n* Canada\n* China\n* France\n* India\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Mexico\n* New Zealand\n* Puerto Rico\n* Russia\n* Saudi Arabia\n* United Kingdom\n* United States\n |\n| Styles\n* British wrestling\n\t+ All-in style\n\t+ Mountevans rules\n* Catch-as-catch-can\n* Cruiserweight\n\t+ X Division\n* Hardcore\n* Intergender\n* *Lucha libre*\n* Midget\n\t+ *Mini-Estrella*\n* *Puroresu*\n* Shoot style\n\t+ *U-Kei*\n* Women's\n |\n| Concepts\n* Attire\n\t+ Masks\n\t+ Wrestling singlet\n\t+ Wrestling shoe\n* Backyarding\n* Blading\n* Championship\n\t+ World Heavyweight\n* Dirt sheet\n* Glossary of terms\n\t+ Kayfabe\n\t+ Gimmick\n\t+ Face\n\t+ Heel\n\t+ Shoot\n\t+ Heat\n\t+ Job\n\t+ Push\n* House show\n* Match types\n* Music\n* Rib\n* Ring name\n* Sports entertainment\n* Tag team\n* Weight classes\n* Wrestling ring\n |\n| Culture\n* Cauliflower Alley Club\n* Cauliflower ear\n* Comic books\n* Films\n\t+ Luchador films\n* Magazines\n* Paintings\n\t+ Gustave Courbet\n\t+ Thomas Eakins\n\t+ William Etty\n\t+ George Luks\n* Ribera Steakhouse\n* Sculpture\n* Ten-bell salute\n* Video games\n* Wrestling personalities in politics\n* Zubaz\n |\n| Media outlets\n* *Botchamania*\n* *Box y Lucha*\n* *Dark Side of the Ring*\n* *Fighting Spirit Magazine*\n* *Live Audio Wrestling*\n* *OSW Review*\n* *Power Slam*\n* *Pro Wrestling Illustrated*\n* *Súper Luchas*\n* *Wrestling Observer Newsletter*\n |\n| Controversies\n* Animals in professional wrestling\n* Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide\n* Death of Owen Hart\n* Mass Transit incident\n* Montreal Screwjob\n* Murder of Bruiser Brody\n* Murder of Rikidōzan\n* Premature deaths\n* Speaking Out\n* *United States v.

Wrestling at first under his real name, Johnson defeated The Brooklyn Brawler at a house show on March 10[62] and lost matches to Chris Candido and Owen Hart.[35] After wrestling at Jerry Lawler's United States Wrestling Association under the name Flex Kavana and winning the USWA tag team championship twice with his partner Bart Sawyer in the summer of 1996, Johnson was signed to a WWF contract. He received additional training from Tom Prichard, alongside Achim Albrecht and Mark Henry.[5][35]\n\n\n\n### World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment[edit]\n\n\n#### Debut; Intercontinental Champion (1996–1997)[edit]\n\n\nJohnson made his WWF debut as Rocky Maivia, a combination of his father and grandfather's ring names, although announcers acknowledged his real name.[63] He was initially reluctant to take this ring name but was persuaded by Vince McMahon and Jim Ross.[43][64] He was given the nickname \"The Blue Chipper\", and to play up his lineage, he was hyped as the WWF's first third-generation wrestler.[3] A clean-cut face character, Maivia was pushed heavily from the start despite his wrestling inexperience. He debuted on *Monday Night Raw* as a member of Marc Mero's entourage on November 4, 1996.[65] His first match came at Survivor Series, on November 17, 1996, in an eight-man elimination tag match; he was the sole survivor and eliminated the final two members of the opposing team, Crush and Goldust.[66] On February 13, 1997, he won the Intercontinental Championship from Hunter Hearst Helmsley on *Monday Night Raw*.[67][68][69] Maivia then successfully defended the title against Helmsley at In Your House 13: Final Four.\n\n\nJohnson's first WrestleMania match came at WrestleMania 13 on March 23, 1997, where he was victorious in his Intercontinental Championship defense against The Sultan. WWF fans started to reject his character and push from the company.[70] He defeated Bret Hart by disqualification in a title defense on the March 31 episode of *Raw is War*.[71] Behind the scenes, Hart mentored Johnson for his first year in WWF[72] and refused to be booked to take the title from him.[73] On April 20, at In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker, he lost to Savio Vega by countout but retained the title. Audiences became increasingly hostile toward Maivia, with chants of \"die, Rocky, die\" and \"Rocky sucks\" being heard during his matches.[2][43]\n\n\nAfter losing the Intercontinental Championship to Owen Hart on the April 28, 1997, episode of *Raw Is War*,[74] Maivia suffered a legitimate knee injury in a match against Mankind in June 1997 and spent several months recovering.[2]\n\n\n\n#### Nation of Domination (1997–1998)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Nation of Domination\n\nUpon returning in August 1997, Maivia turned heel for the first time in his career by lashing out at fans who had been booing him and joining Faarooq, D'Lo Brown and Kama in the stable called the Nation of Domination.[75] He then refused to acknowledge the Rocky Maivia name, instead referring to himself in the third person as the Rock, though he would still be billed as \"The Rock\" Rocky Maivia until 1998. The Rock would then regularly insult the audience, WWF performers, and interviewers in his promos.[75]\n\n\nAt D-Generation X: In Your House on December 7, 1997, Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated the Rock in under six minutes to retain the Intercontinental Championship.[76] The next night on *Raw Is War*, Austin was ordered by Mr. McMahon to defend the title in a rematch, but forfeited it to the Rock instead, handing him the title belt before hitting him with the *Stone Cold Stunner*.[77][78] The Rock feuded with Austin and Ken Shamrock through the end of 1997 and beginning of 1998.[79][80] On January 19, 1998, at the Royal Rumble, the Rock defeated Shamrock by disqualification to retain the Intercontinental title. Later that night, he entered the Royal Rumble match and lasted until the final two before he was eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. On March 29, at WrestleMania XIV, he defeated Shamrock by disqualification once again to retain the title. The next night, on *Raw is War*, the Rock debuted a new Intercontinental Championship design and would later overthrow Faarooq as leader of the Nation of Domination to spark a feud between the two. He then successfully defended the Intercontinental title against Faarooq at Over the Edge: In Your House on May 31. The stable would then refer to themselves as simply \"The Nation\".[81]\n\n\nThe Rock and the Nation then feuded with Triple H and D-Generation X, with the two stable leaders first meeting in the quarter-final of the 1998 King of the Ring tournament, which the Rock won. At King of the Ring, the Rock defeated Dan Severn in the semi-final match and lost to rival Ken Shamrock in the final. The Rock then resumed his feud with Triple H, as the two had a two out of three falls match at Fully Loaded: In Your House for the Intercontinental title, which the Rock retained in controversial fashion.[82] This led to a ladder match at SummerSlam on August 30, 1998, where the Rock lost the title.[83]\n\n\nIn the latter half of 1998, The Rock saw a big uptick in fan support. He also started consolidating his famous persona during this time, which would last until 2000.[84] His popularity caused him to be booked in a feud with fellow Nation members Mark Henry and D'Lo Brown, turning babyface in the process. Henry defeated him at Judgment Day: In Your House on October 18, 1998, after interference from Brown, effectively breaking up the stable.[85][86]\n\n\n\n#### WWF Champion and rise to superstardom (1998–2000)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Corporation and Rock 'n' Sock Connection\n\n![](image)As part of The Corporation, the Rock feuded with Stone Cold Steve Austin and stole Austin's personalized WWF Championship and his \"Smoking Skull\" belt.\nThe Rock was then entered into the \"Deadly Game\" tournament for the vacant WWF Championship. The finals occurred at Survivor Series on November 15, 1998, where the Rock defeated Vince McMahon's associate, Mankind, to win his first WWF Championship.[87][88] A \"double turn\" then occurred as the Rock turned heel again after allying with Vince and Shane McMahon as the crown jewel of their stable, The Corporation, after the McMahons betrayed Mankind.[87][89] On December 13, 1998, at the pay-per-view named after him, Rock Bottom: In Your House, the Rock had a rematch with Mankind for the WWF Championship. Mankind appeared to win the match when the Rock passed out to the Mandible Claw submission move, but Vince McMahon ruled that since the Rock did not tap out, he retained his title.[89][90]\n\n\nIn the main event of the January 4, 1999, episode of *Raw Is War*, Mankind defeated the Rock for the championship after interference from Stone Cold Steve Austin.[91] Then at the Royal Rumble on January 24, 1999, the Rock regained the title in an \"I Quit\" match, a type of submission match that only ends if one of the combatants says \"I quit\" on a microphone. Intended to show a vicious streak in the Rock's character, the Rock hit Mankind in the head with a steel chair 11 times instead of the scripted five, five shots already being risky (most wrestling matches in the Attitude Era involving steel chairs had at most 2 or 3 shots to the head). After the fifth shot, Mankind was still ringside instead of two-thirds up the entrance ramp where he was supposed to be, and after the eleventh shot, which knocked Mankind out, a recording of Mankind saying \"I Quit\" from an earlier interview was played over the public address system.[92][93] On January 31, during an episode of *Sunday Night Heat*, the Rock and Mankind participated in an Empty Arena match, a match that took place in an arena with 22,000 empty seats where any part of the facility could be used to contest the match. After 20 minutes of chaotic brawling in the ring, the stands, a kitchen, the catering area, an office, the arena corridors and finally a basement loading area, Mankind pinned the Rock using a forklift truck to win the WWF title.[94] This match was referred to as \"Halftime Heat\" as it was televised during halftime of that year's Super Bowl.[95] The two faced off again, at St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House on February 14, 1999, in a Last Man Standing match which ended in a draw, meaning Mankind retained the title. Their feud ended on the February 15 *Raw Is War*, when the Rock won his third WWF Championship in a Ladder Match after a debuting Big Show interfered on his behalf.[96][97] The Rock then lost the WWF Championship to Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania XV on March 28, 1999.[98]\n\n\nThe Rock's popularity continued to grow and audiences still cheered for him even though he was a heel. He then lost the title rematch against Stone Cold Steve Austin at Backlash: In Your House on April 25, 1999.[99] The next night on *Raw is War* he was fired from the Corporation after he was betrayed by Shane McMahon, turning him face again and starting a feud with Triple H, The Undertaker and The Corporate Ministry. On April 29, 1999, WWF aired the pilot episode of *SmackDown!*, a term derived from one of the Rock's catchphrases. In the episode, the Rock continued his feud with The Corporate Ministry. This led to a match with Triple H, at Over the Edge on May 23, 1999, which the Rock won,[100] and a match for the WWF Championship against The Undertaker, at King of the Ring, which the Rock lost.[101] The Rock then lost a number one contender's match to Triple H, at Fully Loaded, after interference from \"Mr. Ass\" Billy Gunn.[102] The Rock then defeated Gunn in a Kiss My Ass match at SummerSlam on August 22, 1999. The Rock was also given the privilege of having his own signature match, like The Undertaker with the Buried Alive match, Kane with the Inferno Match and Mankind with the Boiler Room Brawl: the Brahma Bullrope match, a variant of a strap match was a normal singles match where the components are tied together with a rope used for cattle farming, and the rope and its attached cowbell could both be used as weapons. The Rock contested this match twice, both times in Texas (vs Triple H in Dallas, and vs Al Snow in Houston).[103]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock's popularity was fueled by his charisma and speaking abilities, which led to many catchphrases and merchandising opportunities.\nShortly after SummerSlam, the Rock began teaming with former opponent Mankind and the two became known as the Rock 'n' Sock Connection.[104] They became WWF Tag Team Champions for the first time after defeating The Undertaker and Big Show for the titles on the August 30, 1999, episode of *Raw is War*.[105][106] The two performed a number of critically acclaimed comedic skits together, including one called \"This Is Your Life\", which saw Mankind bring parody versions of people from the Rock's past on television, such as his high school girlfriend and his high school football coach, only to have the Rock insult them. The segment earned an 8.4 Nielsen rating, one of the highest ratings ever for a *Raw* segment.[107] The two lost the titles back to Undertaker and Big Show on the September 9 episode of *SmackDown!* and won them back from them on the September 20 episode of *Raw is War*.[108][109] Rock and Mankind then lost the titles to The New Age Outlaws on the very next episode of *SmackDown!*.[110] Rock and Mankind would win the tag titles for the third and final time after beating the New Age Outlaws on the October 14 episode of *SmackDown!* before losing the titles to The Holly Cousins on the October 18 episode of *Raw is War*.[111][112]\n\n\nAt the Royal Rumble, on January 23, 2000, the Rock entered the Royal Rumble match and was one of the final two remaining, along with Big Show. In an attempt at a \"false finish\", Big Show intended to throw the Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, before the Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before reentering the ring as the winner.[113] But the Rock's feet accidentally hit the floor during the reversal attempt, though those watching the event on television did not see that. This was played up in the storyline as Big Show provided additional video footage showing it and claimed to be the rightful winner. The Rock's number one contendership for the WWF Championship was then put on the line against Big Show at No Way Out on February 27, 2000, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered.[114] The Rock then defeated Big Show on the March 13 episode of *Raw Is War*, to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, in a Fatal Four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley.[115][116] Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife Stephanie, Foley had Linda, the Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane.[116][117] The Rock lasted until the final two but was eliminated by Triple H after Vince betrayed him by hitting him with a chair.[117][118]\n\n\nDue to his image at the time, a Magic: The Gathering deck archetype was named after him.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Record-breaking world champion (2000–2002)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock as the WWF Champion in 2000\nIn the following weeks, the Rock continued his feud with Triple H and eventually won his fourth WWF Championship, which he won on April 30, at Backlash, after Stone Cold Steve Austin intervened on his behalf.[120][121] The following night on *Raw*, he successfully defended his title against Shane McMahon in a Steel Cage match. On May 21, at Judgment Day, the Rock faced Triple H in an Iron Man match with Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee.[122] With the score tied at five falls each, and with seconds left on the time limit, the Rock was disqualified when The Undertaker attacked Triple H, thus giving Triple H the 6–5 win and the title.[122][123] The Rock won the WWF Championship for a fifth time at King of the Ring on June 25 by scoring the winning pin in a six-man tag team match, teaming with Kane and The Undertaker against Shane McMahon, Triple H and Vince McMahon, whom he pinned.[124][125] The Rock successfully defended the championship against Chris Benoit, on July 23, at Fully Loaded. The next month, he successfully defended his title against Kurt Angle and Triple H at SummerSlam. The Rock had another successful title defense against Benoit, Kane and The Undertaker, on September 24, at Unforgiven.[126]\n\n\nThe Rock then lost the WWF Championship to Kurt Angle, at No Mercy, on October 22, 2000.[127] The next month, the Rock feuded with Rikishi and defeated him at Survivor Series.[128] The Rock wrestled a six-man Hell in a Cell match for the WWF Championship, at Armageddon, which Angle won to retain the title.[129] On the December 18 episode of *Raw*, the Rock won the WWF Tag Team Championship with The Undertaker, defeating Edge and Christian, before losing it back to them the next night at a *SmackDown!* taping.[130] In 2001, the Rock continued to feud with Angle over the WWF Championship, culminating at No Way Out on February 25, 2001, where he pinned Angle to win the WWF Championship for a sixth time.[131][132] The Rock then feuded with the Royal Rumble winner, Stone Cold Steve Austin, whom he lost the title to at WrestleMania X-Seven after Austin allied with Vince McMahon, who interfered on his behalf.[133] On the next night's *Raw Is War*, during a steel cage title rematch, Triple H attacked the Rock, allying with McMahon and Austin and helping Austin retain the championship.[134] Austin and Triple H then formed a tag team called The Power Trip,[135] while the Rock was indefinitely suspended in storyline. Johnson used this time off to act in *The Scorpion King*.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock taunting an opponent at ringside at *WWF Raw*, October 2001\nThe Rock returned in late July 2001 when the WWF was feuding with rival promotions World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) during what is known as The Invasion storyline. In reality, WCW was purchased by Vince McMahon and the WWF, and ECW had gone out of business in early 2001. Many former WCW and ECW wrestlers were then brought onto WWF television and formed The Alliance to compete with WWF in storyline. The Alliance and Vince McMahon then both attempted to persuade the Rock to join their team. The Rock then aligned with McMahon and the WWF. The next month, the Rock defeated Booker T, at SummerSlam, to win the WCW Championship for the first time.[136][137] He later lost the title to Chris Jericho at No Mercy on October 21, 2001.[138][139] The next night on *Raw*, he teamed with Jericho to win the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Dudley Boyz. The two then lost the tag titles to Booker T and Test on the November 1, 2001, episode of *SmackDown!*.[140] The Rock defeated Jericho on the November 5 episode of *Raw* for his second WCW Championship.[141]\n\n\nAs part of the WWF's battle against The Alliance, the Rock wrestled in a \"winner takes all\" five-on-five elimination tag team match at Survivor Series where the losing team's company would be dissolved in storyline. He was a member of Team WWF along with Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and Big Show. The Alliance's team consisted of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Shane McMahon. In the end, it came down to a one-on-one between the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Rock seemed to have the upper hand, until his teammate Jericho entered the ring and attacked the Rock. Austin tried to capitalize on this by pinning the Rock, but Kurt Angle revealed his true allegiance by attacking Austin. The Rock then pinned Austin, giving Team WWF the victory and forcing The Alliance to disband. The Rock's WCW Championship was renamed the unbranded \"World Championship\" following the Alliance's loss.[142] At the next pay-per-view, Vengeance on December 9, 2001, the Rock lost the World Championship to Jericho, who would then unify the WWF and World titles later that night.[143] The Rock then unsuccessfully challenged Jericho for the now Undisputed WWF Championship at Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002.[144]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock doing his signature pose before wrestling Hulk Hogan (bottom right) at WrestleMania X8, March 2002\nAt the next pay-per-view, No Way Out on February 17, 2002, the Rock defeated The Undertaker in a singles match. The event also saw the WWF debut of the famed WCW faction New World Order, which at the time consisted of \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall.[145] This later led to a match between the Rock and Hogan at WrestleMania X8 on March 17, 2002. The match was billed as \"icon versus icon\", with both men representing the top tier of two generations of wrestling; ultimately the Rock pinned Hogan at WrestleMania X8 to win the match.[146] Despite the Rock portraying a heroic character and Hogan a villain, a portion of the crowd attending the SkyDome was rooting heavily for Hogan.[147][148] In an interview in 2013, Hogan said he and the Rock changed the style of the match on the fly based on the crowd's response.[149] After the introduction of the first-ever brand extension, the WWF held a \"draft lottery\" on the March 25, 2002, episode of *Raw*. The Rock was the number one overall pick, going to the SmackDown! brand before taking a sabbatical from wrestling.[150]\n\n\nThe Rock made a surprise return on a June episode of *Raw* before going to his assigned brand of SmackDown!. There, he was named the number one contender for the WWE Undisputed Championship, which he won for a record-setting seventh time at Vengeance, on July 21, by defeating Kurt Angle and then-champion The Undertaker in a Triple Threat match.[151][152] The Rock successfully defended the title at the Global Warning event against Triple H and Brock Lesnar after pinning Triple H.[153] On August 25, at SummerSlam, after interference from Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman, the Rock lost the WWE Undisputed Championship to Lesnar along with the record for the youngest WWE Champion, which he had set in 1998.[154] In 2018, writing for *ESPN.com*, Sean Coyle noted in a retrospective review of the event, that following his victory over Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania X8, the Rock \"started to see a dip in fan support\" and \"that dip turned into a plunge\" by the time Rock had his match with Lesnar at SummerSlam because fans knew he was leaving WWE to pursue an acting career,[155] as evidenced by the negative crowd response during his match with Lesnar.[156] After SummerSlam ended, the Rock was visibly angry at the crowd reaction. When he tried to do a post-show speech for the crowd, the fans booed him.[157] The Rock then took time off to kickstart his acting career.[158]\n\n\n\n#### Final feuds and departure (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\nThe Rock returned on the January 30, 2003, episode of *SmackDown!* to set up another match with Hulk Hogan at No Way Out.[159] Because of negative fan reaction during previous matches as a result of his budding acting career, The Rock turned heel for the first time since 1999. He also started a new persona that has been called *Hollywood Rock*, with a new look and a shaved head.[160][161] The Rock defeated Hogan at No Way Out before moving to the Raw brand.[162] There, he had various small feuds, including one with The Hurricane.[163] He also began performing \"Rock Concerts\", segments in which he played the guitar and mocked WWE performers and fans in song.[164]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin (left) in Austin's final match at WrestleMania XIX in March 2003.\nAfter failing to win a number one contendership for the World Heavyweight Championship, The Rock went into another program with Stone Cold Steve Austin. This led to a match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, 2003, which called back to their previous two WrestleMania encounters, both of which Austin had won.[165] The Rock won after delivering three consecutive *Rock Bottoms*, ending their long-running rivalry in what turned out to be Austin's final match.[2][166] The next night, *Raw* was billed as \"The Rock Appreciation Night\", in honor of his victory over Austin. That night, he was attacked by a debuting Goldberg.[167] At Backlash on April 27, 2003, Goldberg defeated The Rock, who then briefly left WWE to film *Walking Tall*.[2][168]\n\n\nDuring the rest of the year, The Rock made occasional appearances, returning to a face character.[169] In 2004, The Rock aided Mick Foley in his feud against Evolution,[3][2][170] leading to a reunion of the Rock 'n' Sock Connection. They lost against Ric Flair, Randy Orton, and Batista in a handicap match at WrestleMania XX on March 14, 2004, when Orton pinned Foley after an *RKO*.[2][171] This was Johnson's final wrestling match until November 2011. The Rock appeared in WWE sporadically following WrestleMania XX. He made returns to provide support for Eugene against Jonathan Coachman, and made a cameo in his hometown of Miami and helped Mick Foley against La Résistance.[2] Later in 2004, he hosted a pie-eating contest, as part of the WWE Diva Search, and ended the segment by giving Coachman a *People's Elbow*.[2] The Rock's contract with WWE then ended and he started his full-time acting career.[172]\n\n\n\n#### Non-wrestling appearances (2007–2009)[edit]\n\n\nOn March 12, 2007, the Rock appeared on a WWE show after nearly three years, via a pre-taped promo shown during *Raw*. He correctly predicted that Bobby Lashley would defeat Umaga at WrestleMania 23 in Donald Trump's and Vince McMahon's \"Battle of the Billionaires\" Hair vs. Hair match.[173] On March 29, 2008, Johnson inducted his father Rocky Johnson and grandfather Peter Maivia into the WWE Hall of Fame.[174] His next appearance was through a pre-taped promo on October 2, 2009, during the *Decade of SmackDown*.[175]\n\n\n\n### Independent circuit (2009)[edit]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2009, the Rock appeared at a World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) show to support the professional wrestling debut of Sarona Snuka, the daughter of his longtime friend and mentor Jimmy Snuka.[176]\n\n\n\n### Return to WWE[edit]\n\n\n#### Feud with John Cena (2011–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock in the ring as WrestleMania XXVII host, April 2011\nOn February 14, 2011, the Rock was announced as the host of WrestleMania XXVII on April 3, 2011, appearing live on *Raw* for the first time in almost seven years. During a lengthy promo, he addressed the fans and started a feud with John Cena.[177][178] After numerous appearances via satellite, the Rock appeared live on the *Raw* before WrestleMania XXVII to confront Cena. After he and Cena exchanged insults, The Miz and Alex Riley appeared and attacked the Rock; he fended off Miz and Riley, only for Cena to blindside him with an *Attitude Adjustment*.[179]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock and John Cena (left) on *Raw*, agreeing to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII one year in advance\nOn April 3, at WrestleMania XXVII, the Rock opened the show by cutting a promo. After appearing in numerous backstage segments, the Rock came to ringside to restart the main event between Cena and The Miz as a No Disqualification match, after it had ended in a draw. As revenge for the *Attitude Adjustment* Cena had given him on *Raw*, Rock hit Cena with the *Rock Bottom*, allowing The Miz to pin him and retain the WWE Championship. After the match, Rock attacked Miz and hit him with the *People's Elbow*.[180] The next night on *Raw*, the Rock and Cena agreed to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII the next year. They then worked together to fend off an attack by The Corre, which at the time consisted of Wade Barrett, Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel, and Ezekiel Jackson.[181]\n\n\nThe Rock appeared live on *Raw* in his hometown of Miami to celebrate his 39th birthday.[182] On September 16, WWE announced the Rock would wrestle in a traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series tag team match, teaming with Cena at Survivor Series in November.[183] But on the October 24 episode of *Raw*, Cena instead suggested the Rock be his partner in a standard tag team match against The Miz and R-Truth, a team called Awesome Truth,[184] which Rock agreed to the next week.[185] On November 14, during the special *Raw Gets Rocked*, the Rock appeared live, delivering *Rock Bottom*s to Mick Foley, who had been hosting a \"This Is Your Life\"-style segment for Cena, and later both members of Awesome Truth.[186] The Rock and Cena defeated Awesome Truth on November 20 at Survivor Series, when the Rock pinned The Miz. After the match, the Rock gave Cena a *Rock Bottom*.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock celebrating his victory at WrestleMania XXVIII, April 2012\nLeading up to WrestleMania, the Rock and Cena had several verbal confrontations on *Raw*.[188][189] On the March 12, 2012, episode of *Raw*, the Rock hosted his first \"Rock Concert\" segment since 2004, mocking Cena in his songs.[190] On April 1, at WrestleMania XXVIII, the Rock defeated Cena in the main event after countering Cena's attempt at a *People's Elbow* into a *Rock Bottom* and pinning Cena.[191] This event broke the record for biggest professional wrestling pay-per-view buyrate. The following night on *Raw*, the Rock praised Cena, calling their match \"an honor\". He then vowed to once again become WWE Champion.[192]\n\n\nOn July 23, at *Raw 1000*, the Rock announced he would wrestle for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view. During the show, he encountered then-reigning WWE Champion CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, and John Cena, all of whom expressed a desire to face him. The Rock later saved Cena from an assault by Big Show, only to be laid out by CM Punk.[193] On the January 7, 2013, episode of *Raw*, the Rock returned to confront his Royal Rumble opponent CM Punk.[194] On January 11, he made his first *SmackDown* appearance in ten years, getting into an altercation with Team Rhodes Scholars, resulting in him delivering a *Rock Bottom* to Damien Sandow and a *People's Elbow* to Cody Rhodes.[195] The Rock closed out the 20th-anniversary episode of *Raw*, on January 14, with one of his \"Rock Concerts\", leading to a brawl with CM Punk.[196] The following week on *Raw*, the Rock was attacked by The Shield. Vince McMahon then asserted that if The Shield attacked the Rock in his title match with CM Punk, Punk would be stripped of the WWE Championship.[197]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock revealing the brand new WWE Championship design on *WWE Raw*, February 2013\nOn January 27, at the Royal Rumble, CM Punk would seemingly defeat the Rock after the arena lights went out and someone attacked the Rock. Vince McMahon then came out and was about to strip Punk of the championship, however, at the Rock's request, he instead restarted the match. This culminated in the Rock defeating Punk to win his eighth WWE Championship.[198] Punk received a title rematch with the Rock, at Elimination Chamber on February 17, 2013, with the added stipulation that if the Rock was disqualified or counted out, he would still lose the WWE Championship. The Rock would pin Punk to defeat him and retain the championship.[199] The following night on *Raw*, the Rock unveiled a new WWE Championship design, with a different center plate and removable customizable side-plates which had his \"Brahma Bull\" logo.[200] The Rock then resumed his rivalry with John Cena, who won that year's Royal Rumble to set up a rematch of the previous WrestleMania match between the two at WrestleMania 29, only this time with the WWE Championship on the line.[201][202]\n\n\nOn April 7, at WrestleMania 29, Rock lost the WWE Championship to Cena, ending his reign at 70 days.[203] Despite being advertised for *Raw* after WrestleMania, where it was stated that the Rock was still entitled a rematch for the WWE Championship,[204] The Rock did not appear because of a real injury sustained during his match with Cena, in which his abdominal and adductor tendons tore from his pelvis.[205] Johnson underwent surgery on April 23 to reattach the torn tendons.[206]\n\n\n\n#### Sporadic appearances (2014–2023)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock (right) confronts Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania XXX, April 2014.\n![](image)The Wyatt Family confronting The Rock at WrestleMania 32, April 2016\nIn April 2014, the Rock appeared in the opening segment of WrestleMania XXX along with Stone Cold Steve Austin and Hulk Hogan.[207] On the October 6 episode of *Raw*, the Rock made a surprise appearance to confront Rusev and Lana; this resulted in the Rock clearing Rusev from the ring.[208]\n\n\nThe Rock appeared at the 2015 Royal Rumble event on January 25, 2015, during the main event match, where he helped his relative Roman Reigns fend off Big Show and Kane after Reigns eliminated them from the match. Reigns then won the match and the Rock endorsed him in the ring.[209][210][211] The Rock appeared at WrestleMania 31 on March 29, 2015, alongside Ronda Rousey, getting into an in-ring altercation with Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. Rock and Rousey prevailed after he attacked Triple H and she overpowered McMahon.[212] On June 27, the Rock appeared at a live event in Boston, where he confronted Bo Dallas and gave him a *Rock Bottom*.[213]\n\n\nOn the January 25, 2016, episode of *Raw*, the Rock was in a segment that saw him converse with The Miz, Big Show, Lana and Rusev before he and his relatives, The Usos, got into an altercation with then-WWE Tag Team Champions, The New Day.[214] The Rock appeared at WrestleMania 32 on April 3, 2016, where he announced that WWE had broken the all-time WrestleMania attendance record before being interrupted by The Wyatt Family. The Rock got into a verbal back-and-forth with Bray Wyatt before having an impromptu match with Wyatt Family member Erick Rowan. The Rock won after giving Rowan a *Rock Bottom* and pinning him in six seconds, which set the record for the fastest win in WrestleMania history. The Rock was then aided by a returning John Cena to fend off Wyatt, Rowan and Braun Strowman.[215] On the February 20, 2017, episode of *Raw*, the Rock made an untelevised appearance after the broadcast had gone off the air, where he promoted and filmed a scene for his then-upcoming film *Fighting with My Family*.[216]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2019, the Rock officially announced his retirement from professional wrestling.[217] On September 30, 2019, after weeks of speculation, the Rock announced that he would appear on *SmackDown*'s 20th Anniversary on October 4, 2019, marking his first appearance on SmackDown since October 2014 and his first televised appearance since April 2016.[218] At the event, he cut a promo with Becky Lynch before they were interrupted by King Corbin. After attacking Corbin, the Rock and Lynch celebrated in the ring.[219]\n\n\nOn September 15, 2023, the Rock made a surprise return to SmackDown to take out Austin Theory. This marks his first televised appearance on WWE since October 4, 2019.[220]\n\n\n\n### Impact Wrestling (2020)[edit]\n\n\nThe Rock made an appearance at Impact Wrestling's 2020 Bound for Glory on October 20, 2020, in Nashville via a recorded video message to induct Ken Shamrock into the Impact Hall of Fame.[221][222]\n\n\n\n### Mainstream crossover[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock in a 2001 *Vanity Fair* photo shoot\nThe Rock appeared on Wyclef Jean's 2000 single \"It Doesn't Matter\" and in its music video.[223][224] He also recorded \"Pie\" with Slick Rick for *WWF The Music, Vol. 5*.[225]\n\n\nIn 1999, Johnson appeared on *That '70s Show* as his father Rocky Johnson. The next year, he was on *Star Trek: Voyager* as an alien wrestler who used the Rock's moves.[226]\n\n\nIn 2000, he hosted *Saturday Night Live* (SNL) for the first time.[227] Fellow wrestlers Triple H, Big Show, and Mick Foley also appeared on the show.[3][228] Johnson has said the success of that episode is the reason he began receiving offers from Hollywood studios.[229] He has since hosted SNL four more times.\n\n\nIn 1999, the Rock was listed No. 5 on *Entertainment Weekly*'s Top 12 Entertainers of the Year.[230] In 2000, *Access Hollywood* ranked him number six in their list of the Top 10 Celebrities of 2000.[231] That year, Rock was also listed in the Forbes Celebrity 100 and *People* Magazine's 25 Most Intriguing People.[232][233]\n\n\nThe Rock was listed on *Entertainment Weekly*'s 101 Most Influential People in both 2000 and 2001.[234] In 2001, he was also listed on E!'s 20 Top Entertainers.[235][236] In 2002, the Rock was listed on E!'s 25 Toughest Stars.[237] In 2003, he was listed in VH1's 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons[238] and was No. 13 in *People* Magazine's 50 Favorite TV Stars.[239]\n\n\nThe Rock made a surprise appearance at the official Xbox unveiling during Bill Gates's keynote speech at the ongoing Computer Electronics Show in 2001.[240]\n\n\nJohnson's motion picture debut was as The Scorpion King in *The Mummy Returns* (2001).[241] The movie broke a two-year record for the highest-grossing single day in film history by earning $28,594,667.[242][3][227] The movie's financial success led to Johnson's first leading role in the spin-off *The Scorpion King* (2002).[3] He received $5.5 million for the role and *Guinness World Records* named him the record-holder for highest-paid actor in their first leading role.[243][244]\n\n\nThe Rock has appeared on the covers of many magazines, including *Rolling Stone*, *Entertainment Weekly*, and *TV Guide*.[245][246][247] He has also appeared in, and been the cover athlete for, several video games.[248]\n\n\nAs of November 2021[update], his Instagram account is the fourth most-followed in the world, with over 280 million followers.[249]\n\n\n\n### Legacy and career assessment[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **possibly contains original research**.

Many have placed the Rock on their \"Mount Rushmore of Pro Wrestling\", including Hulk Hogan,[250] Ric Flair,[251] and John Cena.[252] In \"Cable Visions: Television Beyond Broadcasting\", the Rock was described as \"for a long time, the WWE's biggest star and probably held the greatest international appeal\".[253] R.

Reynolds stated in his book \"The WrestleCrap Book of Lists\" that the Rock was \"the biggest star for WWE from 1999 until 2004\".[254]\n\n\nThe Rock's \"I quit\" match with Mankind at the 1999 Royal Rumble event is infamous for its brutality and one of the most popular \"I quit\" match of all times.[255][256][257][258]\n\n\nThe Rock main-evented the most bought pay-per-view worldwide in WWE history (WrestleMania XXVIII),[259] the most bought pay-per-view domestically in WWE history (WrestleMania X-Seven), the highest rated *Raw* in history,[260][261] the highest rated *SmackDown* in history,[262] and was part of the highest rated cable segment in WWE history with Mankind entitled \"This is Your Life\", in which Mankind would honor The Rock with various gifts and reunions.[263][264] His return in 2001 had a 7.1 rating, the highest-rated segment of the year. The Rock was also part of the highest-rated match of the 21st century when his WWF Championship defense against Shane McMahon, on May 1, 2000, got an 8.3 rating, making it the highest-rated segment of all time, behind \"This Is Your Life\".\n\n\nIn 2011, the Rock's return to an episode of *Raw* generated an average of 4.7 million viewers in the United States, with 7.4 million tuning in during his promo.[265] *Raw 1000* was the highest rated *Raw* episode of 2012 and his segment with CM Punk and Daniel Bryan was the highest rated segment of the show.[266] In 2013, the night after the Rock won the WWE Championship for the first time in over a decade, at Royal Rumble, *Raw* got its highest rating of that year.[267]\n\n\nDerived from one of his catchphrases \"lay the smackdown\", in 1999 WWE introduced its second flagship program, *WWE SmackDown*, which became television's second longest-running weekly episodic program in history.[268] The term \"smackdown\" was included in Merriam-Webster dictionaries in 2007.[269][270] He is also known for popularizing the term \"jabroni\", derived from \"jobber\", although it was originally introduced by The Iron Sheik.[271][272]\n\n\nThe Rock holds the record for most *Raw* shows main-evented in one year (38 in 2000),[273] most *SmackDown* shows main-evented in one year (36 in 2000)[274] and tied with Stone Cold Steve Austin (in 2001)[275] for most PPV shows main evented in one year (12 in 2000).[276]\n\n\nAt the 2021 Survivor Series, WWE held a 25-man Battle Royal to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of The Rock's WWE debut. The match was won by Omos.[277]\n\n\n\n## Acting career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Johnson in April 2009\n### Career beginnings (2001–2010)[edit]\n\n\nJohnson entered Hollywood and the film industry, becoming a star initially through his wrestling popularity and noted work ethic. Over his acting career, he became one of the highest-paid and most successful actors in Hollywood.[278][279][280][281] He began his acting career on television while wrestling. In his first television acting job, in 1999, he played his father in an episode of *That '70s Show* called \"That Wrestling Show\". Nearly a year later, he appeared in the *Star Trek: Voyager* episode \"Tsunkatse\" as an alien wrestler who fought popular character Seven of Nine. While Johnson was away from WWE, the company continued to sell \"The Rock\" merchandise, and he continued to be featured prominently in the opening montages of their television shows.[35]\n\n\nJohnson began his film career in earnest with roles in *The Mummy Returns* (2001), *The Scorpion King* (2002), *The Rundown* (2003), and *Walking Tall* (2004). He had a supporting role in *Be Cool* (2005) as a bodyguard hoping to become an actor,[282] and was the primary antagonist in *Doom* (2005). He also had roles in *Gridiron Gang* (2006), *Reno 911!: Miami* (2007), and *Southland Tales* (2006). He played a cocky famous American football player in *The Game Plan* (2007) and Agent 23 in *Get Smart* (2008). He presented the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects at the 80th Academy Awards.[283]\n\n\n\n### Stardom with blockbuster roles (2011–2020)[edit]\n\n\nJohnson's first big box-office success came in 2011, portraying Luke Hobbs in *Fast Five* (2011); the film became the seventh highest-grossing film of 2011. He became known for reinvigorating film franchises after portraying Marvin F. Hinton / Roadblock in *G.I. Joe: Retaliation* and reprising his role as Luke Hobbs in *Fast & Furious 6* (2013),[284][285] while also starring in true-story films *Pain & Gain* (2013) and *Empire State* (2013). That same year, he hosted and produced the TNT reality competition series *The Hero*,[286][287] and won the Favorite Male Buttkicker Award at the 2013 Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Awards.[288] In May 2013, it was announced that he would executive produce and star in *Ballers*,[289] an HBO comedy-drama series about NFL players living in Miami.[290] By December of that year, *Forbes* named him the top-grossing actor of 2013, with his films bringing in $1.3 billion worldwide for the year. *Forbes* credited the success of *Fast & Furious 6*, which grossed $789 million globally, and his frequent acting work as primary reasons for topping the list.[291]\n\n\nJohnson starred as the title character in *Hercules* (2014)[292] and reprised his role as Luke Hobbs in *Furious 7* (2015).[293] He hosted another reality series for TNT in 2014, entitled *Wake Up Call*, which saw him \"lending a helping hand to everyday people who were facing enormous challenges in their lives\" alongside guest experts such as Rocco DiSpirito, Jillian Michaels, and Josh Shipp.[294] In 2016, Johnson co-starred with Kevin Hart in the action-comedy *Central Intelligence* and had a lead voice role in the Disney animated film *Moana*, in which he voiced the Polynesian demigod Maui. He reprised his role as Luke Hobbs in *The Fate of the Furious*, which was released in 2017. Johnson starred in two other blockbuster movies that year, *Baywatch* and *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* as Mitchell \"Mitch\" Buchannon and Dr. Smolder Bravestone, respectively.[295][296] In 2018, he starred in the action films *Rampage* and *Skyscraper*.\n\n\n\n![](image)Johnson's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in July 2022\nJohnson's role within the *Fast & Furious* franchise continued with *Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw*, starring alongside co-star Jason Statham. David Leitch directed the project from a script co-written by franchise-writer Chris Morgan and Drew Pearce. The film began principal photography in September 2018, and was released on July 26, 2019. Johnson will reprise his role in *Hobbs & Shaw 2* after not appearing in *F9* and also not returning in *Fast X* or *Fast & Furious 11*.[297][298] In May 2023, it was reported that he would make a cameo appearance during a post-credits scene of *Fast X*.[299] Johnson reprised his role as Bravestone, in *Jumanji: The Next Level*. With the critical and financial success of *Welcome to the Jungle*, production of the movie began in early 2019, and it was released on December 13, 2019.[300]\n\n\n\n### Career expansion (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Johnson co-starred with Emily Blunt in Disney's *Jungle Cruise* as Frank Wolff. The film is based on the theme-park ride of the same name.[301] Jaume Collet-Serra directed, with a script by Michael Green from a previous one by J. D. Payne and Patrick McKay.[302][303][304][305][306] In addition to his work on the film, Johnson assisted with re-designing the titular ride for all Disney theme parks.[307] *Jungle Cruise* was released on July 30, 2021.[308][309][310] Also in 2021, Johnson starred in Netflix's film *Red Notice*, written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber. It is the third time that the two collaborated, after *Central Intelligence* and *Skyscraper*.[311][312] It co-stars Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds.[313]\n\n\nJohnson is noted for his busy schedule and developing multiple projects at once.[314][315] A sequel to the box-office hit *San Andreas* was announced to be in the pre-production stage with the director of the first film, Brad Peyton, returning as director along with the main cast (marking the fourth collaboration between the two following *Journey 2*, *San Andreas*, and *Rampage*).[316][296]\n\n\nOn November 14, 2019, he announced a December 2021 release date for the standalone *Black Adam* film.[317] Production on *Black Adam* began filming in April 2021 with it set to release on October 21, 2022.[318][319] He earned $22.5 million to star in the film and received millions more for producing and promoting it on social media.[320]\n\n\nJohnson has been a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in the Actor's Branch since 2017.[321]\n\n\nOn March 16, 2021, he appeared for the first time as The Foundation in Fortnite Battle Royale. Johnson was initially uncredited in his role, yet teased his involvement in a cryptic Instagram post shared on the day of the event. Following another Instagram video for Johnson's ZOA Energy drink, in which The Foundation's helmet and sidearm were subtly featured in the background, his involvement was finally confirmed during the Chapter 2 End Event on December 4, 2021, with The Foundation removing his helmet to reveal that he shared Johnson's voice and likeness.[322]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Johnson reprised his role as Luke Hobbs in a cameo appearance during the mid-credits scene of *Fast X*.\n\n\n\n## Producer[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Johnson founded his production company Seven Bucks Productions.[24]\n\n\nThough originally attached as producer and star, Johnson will now serve solely as the former on a film adaptation of *The Janson Directive*. John Cena will fill the leading role, with Akiva Goldsman attached as screenwriter.[323] Additionally, he will produce and star in a Netflix exclusive film titled *John Henry & The Statesmen*, as the titular folklore hero. The film will be directed by Jake Kasdan, from a script by Kasdan and Tom Wheeler. With the first official teaser trailer released in October 2018, the project marks Kasdan's and Johnson's third collaboration, after *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* and *Jumanji: The Next Level*.[324]\n\n\nIn 2019, Johnson produced and appeared as himself in *Fighting with My Family*, a comedy drama about Paige and her family, who are also professional wrestlers.[325][326]\n\n\nJohnson will co-produce and star in *The King*, a film about king Kamehameha Kūnuiākea, founder and first ruler of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. The project will be directed by Robert Zemeckis from a script by Randall Wallace. The movie will be comparable to *Braveheart* in tone, given Wallace's work on both films, and will depict the king's role in resolving the wars among the islands of Hawaiʻi. *The King* was scheduled to begin production in 2020, but was halted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[327] Johnson is also attached to produce/star in a sequel to *Big Trouble in Little China*,[328][329] as well as project under development with Shane Black focusing on a new interpretation of Doc Savage.[330]\n\n\nIn 2021, his biographical comedy-drama series *Young Rock* began airing on NBC.[331]\n\n\nA film centered around Teth-Adam/Black Adam, a part of the DC Extended Universe, was announced to be in development in January 2017. Originally cast in the role as early as September 2014 as the antagonist, in a film centered around the superhero Billy Batson/Shazam,[332][333] his villainous role for *Shazam!* was reworked into two separate films.[334] Johnson did not appear in *Shazam!*, but he served as a producer and his likeness was used through special effects in flashback scenes.[335][336]\n\n\n\n## Other work[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, Johnson published his autobiography, *The Rock Says...*, co-written with Joe Layden. It debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list and remained on the list for several weeks.[22]\n\n\nIn 2013, Johnson hosted and produced the TNT reality competition series *The Hero*.[286][337] In 2014, he hosted another TNT reality series, *Wake Up Call*.[294] In 2019, Johnson started hosting the NBC competition series *The Titan Games*.[338]\n\n\nIn March 2016, Johnson partnered with American fitness apparel manufacturer Under Armour to release \"Project Rock\".[339] The first item in his partnership with Under Armour, a gym bag, sold out in a couple of days.[340][341] His second item, a black T-shirt sporting his signature \"Brahma bull\", sold out after being worn at WrestleMania 32.[342] Johnson also released an alarm clock app as part of \"Project Rock\" that received more than one million downloads in its first week of release.[343] Since then, they have released sneakers, headphones, and other apparel.[344]\n\n\nIn 2016, Johnson started his YouTube channel. His first video, *The YouTube Factory*, featured online personality Lilly Singh and several other internet stars.[345]\n\n\nIn 2019, Johnson announced he would launch a competitive bodybuilding show, \"Athleticon\", with his business partner and ex-wife Dany Garcia. It is set to rival other long-standing bodybuilding shows such as The Arnold Classic and Joe Weider's Mr. Olympia.[346] The show was set to debut in October 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia, but plans were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[346]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Johnson launched Teremana Tequila which sold 600,000 nine-litre cases in its first year.[347]\n\n\nA fan of the rapper Tech N9ne,[348] Johnson is featured on the song \"Face Off\" from the rapper's 2021 album *Asin9ne*.[349]\n\n\n\n## Activism and philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nJohnson attended the 2000 Democratic National Convention[350] as part of WWE's non-partisan \"Smackdown Your Vote\" campaign, which aimed to influence young people to vote.[351] He also had a speaking role at the 2000 Republican National Convention.[352]\n\n\nJohnson voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections.[245] He did not vote in the 2016 election,[353] and is an independent voter as of 2017[update].[354] He endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.[355] Johnson has expressed interest in running for president himself, telling *USA Today* in February 2021, \"I would consider a presidential run in the future if that's what the people wanted\".[356] Following an online public opinion poll that found that 46% of Americans would consider voting for Johnson in a presidential election, he said in an April 12, 2021, interview on *The Today Show*, \"I do have that goal to unite our country and I also feel that if this is what the people want, then I will do that\".[357]\n\n\nIn 2006, Johnson founded the Dwayne Johnson Rock Foundation, a charity working with at-risk and terminally ill children.[358] On October 2, 2007, he and his then wife, Dany Garcia, donated $1 million to the University of Miami to support the renovation of its football facilities. The university renamed the Hurricanes' locker room in Johnson's honor.[359] In 2015, Johnson donated $1,500 to a GoFundMe to pay for an abandoned dog's surgery.[360] In 2017, he donated $25,000 to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts.[361] In 2018, Johnson donated a gym to a military base in Oahu, Hawaii.[362] After the 2018 Hawaii floods, he worked with Malama Kauai, a nonprofit organization, to help repair flood damage.[363] Johnson has also worked with Make-A-Wish Foundation on a number of occasions.[364]\n\n\nIn July 2023, Johnson made a seven-figure donation to the SAG-AFTRA Foundation during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, which foundation president Courtney B. Vance cited to be \"the largest single donation that (the foundation) has ever received from one individual at one time\".[365]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nJohnson first met fellow University of Miami student Dany Garcia in the early 1990s. They married on May 3, 1997. She is a businesswoman, IFBB professional bodybuilder, and producer.[366] Their daughter, Simone, was born on August 14, 2001.[366][367] On June 1, 2007, Johnson and Garcia announced they were separating amicably,[366] and their divorce was finalized in May 2008.[368]\n\n\nIn 2007, Johnson began dating Lauren Hashian, the daughter of Boston drummer Sib Hashian.[369] They first met in 2006 while Johnson was filming *The Game Plan*.[370] They were married on August 18, 2019, in Hawaii.[371][372][373] They have two daughters.[374][375] Johnson and Hashian live in Los Angeles, also maintaining a farm in Virginia[376] and a home in Southwest Ranches, Florida.[377][378]\n\n\nIn recognition of his service to the Samoan people, and because he is a descendant of Samoan chiefs, Johnson was given the noble title *Seiuli* (meaning the son of Malietoa [*Alo o Malietoa*]) by Malietoa Tanumafili II during his visit there on August 9, 2004.[379] In 2009, he gained Canadian citizenship through his father's birth and citizenship there.[380] He got a partial Samoan pe'a tattoo on his left side in 2003.[381] In 2017, he had the small \"Brahma bull\" tattoo on his right arm covered with a larger half-sleeve tattoo of a bull's skull.[382]\n\n\nIn February 2020, WWE announced that Johnson's daughter Simone had started training at the WWE Performance Center,[383] making her the first fourth-generation WWE wrestler.[384] On May 16, Johnson announced she had signed a contract with WWE,[385] and in May 2022 announced that her ring name would be Ava Raine.
