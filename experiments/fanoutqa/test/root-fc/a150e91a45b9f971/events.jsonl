As of March 2023[update], Apple is the world's biggest company by market capitalization,[6] and with US$394.3 billion the largest technology company by 2022 revenue.[7] As of June 2022[update], Apple is the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales; the largest manufacturing company by revenue; and the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\n\nApple was founded as **Apple Computer Company** on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as **Apple Computer, Inc.** in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called \"1984\". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\n\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\n\n\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then at $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022. In June 2023, it was valued at just over $3 trillion.[8] The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It has also been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Apple Inc.\n\n### 1976–1980: Founding and incorporation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Apple Inc. § 1971–1985: Jobs and Wozniak\n\n![](image)In 1976, Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in his parents' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California.[9] Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak called the popular belief that the company was founded in the garage \"a bit of a myth\".[10] They moved some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded.[11]\n![](image)The Apple I is Apple's first product, designed by Steve Wozniak and sold as an assembled circuit board without basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case. This unit received an aftermarket keyboard and a wooden case.\n![](image)The Apple II Plus was introduced in 1979, designed primarily by Wozniak.\nApple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership.[9][12] The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[13] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.[14]: 57 Neither received the full selling price but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2023). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[15] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer.[16] It went on sale soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,600 in 2023).[17][18]: 180 Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked \"repeating digits\".[19]\n\n\nApple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[20][21] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded it.[22] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 (equivalent to $1,257,000 in 2023) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[23] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[24]\n\n\nThe Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire.[25] It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. While the Apple I and early Apple II models used ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978.[26][27]\n\n\nThe Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first \"killer application\" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979.[26] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office,[26] but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari, Commodore, and Tandy.[28][29]\n\n\nOn December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol \"AAPL\") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September 3, 2022[update]),[21] generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[30] By the end of the day, 300 millionaires were created, from a stock price of $29 per share[31] and a market cap of $1.778 billion.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### 1980–1990: Success with Macintosh[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Mac models and Timeline of the Apple II family\n\n![](image)The Macintosh, released in 1984, is the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral graphical user interface and mouse.\nA critical moment in the company's history came in December 1979 when Jobs and several Apple employees, including human–computer interface expert Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC in to see a demonstration of the Xerox Alto, a computer using a graphical user interface. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000[32] shares (22.4 million split-adjusted shares as of September 3, 2022[update])[21] of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.[33] After the demonstration, Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface, and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa, named after Jobs's daughter.[34]\n\n\nThe Lisa division was plagued by infighting, and in 1982, Jobs was pushed off the project. The Lisa launched in 1983 and became the first mass marketed personal computer with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price and limited software library.[35]\n\n\nJobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's Macintosh division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.[36] Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.[37]\n\n\nIn 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer without a bundled programming language.[38] Its debut was signified by \"1984\", a $1.5 million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.[39] This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success[40] and was called a \"masterpiece\" by CNN[41] and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by *TV Guide*.[42]\n\n\nThe advertisement created great interest in Macintosh, and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in. Jobs had required 128 kilobytes of RAM, which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of $1,000 (equivalent to $2,900 in 2023). The Macintosh shipped for $2,495 (equivalent to $7,300 in 2023), a price panned by critics due to its slow performance.[43]: 195 In early 1985, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired away from Pepsi two years earlier by Jobs[44] saying, \"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?\"[45] Sculley removed Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division, with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[46]\n\n\nThe board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from leadership.[47] Jean-Louis Gassée informed Sculley that Jobs had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup and called an emergency meeting at which Apple's executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.[47] Jobs resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took several Apple employees with him to found NeXT.[48] Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in 1985 to pursue other ventures, expressing his frustration with Apple's treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years\".[37][49][50] Wozniak remained employed by Apple as a representative,[49] receiving a stipend estimated to be $120,000 per year.[18] Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders after their departures.[51]\n\n\nAfter the departures of Jobs and Wozniak in 1985, Sculley launched the Macintosh 512K that year with quadruple the RAM, and introduced the LaserWriter, the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer. PageMaker, an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language, was also released by Aldus Corporation in July 1985.[52] It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh, LaserWriter, and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.[53]\n\n\nThis dominant position in the desktop publishing market[54] allowed the company to focus on higher price points, the so-called \"high-right policy\" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin, and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in speed. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, due to Jean-Louis Gassée's slogan of \"fifty-five or die\", referring to the 55% profit margins of the Macintosh II.[55]: 79–80\n\n\nThis policy began to backfire late in the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on IBM PC compatibles that offered some of the same functionality of the Macintosh at far lower price points. The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.[55]: 117–129 During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer.[56] Gassée left the company later that year.[57]\n\n\n\n### 1990–1997: Decline and restructuring[edit]\n\n\nThe company pivoted strategy and in October 1990 introduced three lower-cost models, the Macintosh Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.[58] In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.\n\n\n\nThe success of the lower-cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue.[59] For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine *MacAddict* named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh.[60]\n\n![](image)The PenLite is Apple's first tablet computer prototype, created in 1992 to bring the Mac OS to a tablet. It was canceled in favor of the Newton.[61]\nThe success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to the cannibalization of higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points, aimed at different markets: the high-end Quadra series, the mid-range Centris series, and the consumer-marketed Performa series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between so many models.[62]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Apple II series was discontinued, which was expensive to produce, and the company decided was still taking sales away from lower-cost Macintosh models. After the launch of the LC, Apple began encouraging developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to direct consumers away from Apple II and toward Macintosh.[63] The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.[64]\n\n\nApple also experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including digital cameras, portable CD audio players, speakers, video game consoles, the eWorld online service, and TV appliances. Enormous resources were invested in the problem-plagued Newton tablet division, based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.[65]\n\n\nThroughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.[66] Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; instead, they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the Apple Lisa in *Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.*[67] The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed.\n\n\nThe major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apple's reputation, and in 1993 Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler.[68]\n\n\nWith Spindler at the helm, Apple, IBM, and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in 1994 with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform; PReP), which used IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows. That year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh, the first of many computers with Motorola's PowerPC processor.[69]\n\n\nIn the wake of the alliance, Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build Macintosh clones. Over the next two years, 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced. However, by 1996, Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of their own high-end computers, where profit margins were highest.[70]\n\n\nIn 1996, Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO. Hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator, Amelio made deep changes, including extensive layoffs and cost-cutting.[71]\n\n\nThis period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system (MacOS). The original Macintosh operating system (System 1) was not built for multitasking (running several applications at once). The company attempted to correct this with by introducing cooperative multitasking in System 5, but the company still felt it needed a more modern approach.[72] This led to the Pink project in 1988, A/UX that same year, Copland in 1994, and the attempted purchase of BeOS in 1996. Talks with Be stalled when the CEO, former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée, demanded $300 million instead of the $125 million Apple wanted to pay.[73]\n\n\nOnly weeks away from bankruptcy,[74] Apple's board decided NeXTSTEP was a better choice for its next operating system and purchased NeXT in late 1996 for $400 million, bringing back Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.[75]\n\n\n\n### 1997–2007: Return to profitability[edit]\n\n\nThe NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997,[76] and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses.\n\n\nThe board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately began a review of the company's products. Jobs would order 70% of the company's products to be cancelled, resulting in the loss of 3,000 jobs, and taking Apple back to the core of its computer offerings.[77] The next month, in August 1997, Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a $150 million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing software for the Mac.[78] The investment was seen as an \"antitrust insurance policy\" for Microsoft who had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti-competitive practices.[79] Jobs also ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker, Power Computing.[80] On November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the Apple Store website, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing that had been successfully used by PC manufacturer Dell.[81]\n\n\nThe moves paid off for Jobs; at the end of his first year as CEO, the company turned a $309 million profit.[77]\n\n\n\n![](image)\niMac\n![](image)\niBook\n![](image)\nPower Macintosh G3\n![](image)\nPowerBook G3\n\nOn May 6, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh: the iMac. The iMac was a huge success for Apple selling 800,000 units in its first five months[82] and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the 3+1⁄2-inch diskette, being an early adopter of the USB connector, and coming pre-installed with internet connectivity (the \"i\" in iMac)[83] via Ethernet and a dial-up modem. The device also had a striking teardrop shape and translucent materials, designed by Jonathan Ive, who although hired by Amelio, would go on to work collaboratively with Jobs for the next decade to chart a new course the design of Apple's products.[84][85]\n\n\nA little more than a year later on July 21, 1999, Apple introduced the iBook, a laptop for consumers. It was the culmination of a strategy established by Jobs to produce only four products: refined versions of the Power Macintosh G3 desktop and PowerBook G3 laptop for professionals, along with the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers. Jobs felt the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation.[86]\n\n\nAt around the same time, Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers. Apple acquired of Macromedia's Key Grip digital video editing software project which was renamed Final Cut Pro when it was launched on the retail market in April 1999.[87] The development of Key Grip also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product iMovie in October 1999.[88] Next, Apple successfully acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000, which had developed the DVD authoring software DVDirector, which Apple would sell as the professional-oriented DVD Studio Pro software product, and used the same technology to create iDVD for the consumer market.[88] In 2000, Apple purchased the SoundJam MP audio player software from Casady & Greene. Apple renamed the program iTunes, while simplifying the user interface and adding the ability to burn CDs.[89]\n\n\n2001 would be a pivotal year for the Apple with the company making three announcements that would change the course of the company.\n\n\nThe first announcement came on March 24, 2001, that Apple was nearly ready to release a new modern operating system, Mac OS X. The announcement came after numerous failed attempts in the early 1990s, and several years of development. Mac OS X was based on NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, and BSD Unix, with Apple aiming to combine the stability, reliability, and security of Unix with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface, heavily influenced by NeXTSTEP. To aid users in migrating from Mac OS 9, the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 applications within Mac OS X via the Classic Environment.[90]\n\n\nIn May 2001, the company opened its first two Apple Store retail locations in Virginia and California,[91][92] offering an improved presentation of the company's products.[93] At the time, many speculated that the stores would fail,[94] but they went on to become highly successful, and the first of more than 500 stores around the world.[95]\n\n\nOn October 23, 2001, Apple debuted the iPod portable digital audio player. The product, which was first sold on November 10, 2001, was phenomenally successful with over 100 million units sold within six years.[96]\n\n\nIn 2003, Apple's iTunes Store was introduced. The service offered music downloads for 99¢ a song and integration with the iPod. The iTunes Store quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over five billion downloads by June 19, 2008.[97] Two years later, the iTunes Store was the world's largest music retailer.[98]\n\n\nIn 2002, Apple purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositing application Shake,[99] as well as Emagic for the music productivity application Logic. The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company. The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple's consumer-level GarageBand application.[100] The release of iPhoto that year completed the iLife suite.[101]\n\n\n\n![](image)The MacBook Pro is Apple's first laptop with an Intel microprocessor, introduced in 2006.\nAt the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would move away from PowerPC processors, and the Mac would transition to Intel processors in 2006.[102] On January 10, 2006, the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intel's Core Duo CPU. By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced.[102] The Power Mac, iBook, and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the Mac Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.[103] On April 29, 2009, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple was building its own team of engineers to design microchips.[104] Apple also introduced Boot Camp in 2006 to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.[105]\n\n\nApple's success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple's stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80.[106] When Apple surpassed Dell's market cap in January 2006,[107] Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dell's CEO Michael Dell should eat his words.[108] Nine years prior, Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would \"shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders\".[109]\n\n\n\n### 2007–2011: Success with mobile devices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The newly announced iPhone was on display at the 2007 MacWorld Expo.\nDuring his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced the renaming of Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple Inc., because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.[110] This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone[111] and the Apple TV.[112] The company sold 270,000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales,[113] and the device was called \"a game changer for the industry\".[114]\n\n\nIn an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management (DRM), thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players if record labels would agree to drop the technology.[115] On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.[116] Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available without their FairPlay DRM.[117]\n\n\nIn July 2008, Apple launched the App Store to sell third-party applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch.[118] Within a month, the store sold 60 million applications and registered an average daily revenue of $1 million, with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion-dollar business for Apple.[119] By October 2008, Apple was the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.[120]\n\n\nOn January 14, 2009, Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health. In the email, Jobs stated that \"the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well\", and explained that the break would allow the company \"to focus on delivering extraordinary products\".[121] Though Jobs was absent, Apple recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during the recession with revenue of $8.16 billion and profit of $1.21 billion.[122]\n\n\nAfter years of speculation and multiple rumored \"leaks\", Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and all iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, though having very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the U.S. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.[123] In May of the same year, Apple's market cap exceeded that of competitor Microsoft for the first time since 1989.[124]\n\n\nIn June 2010, Apple released the iPhone 4,[125] which introduced video calling using FaceTime, multitasking, and a new uninsulated stainless steel design that acted as the phone's antenna. Later that year, Apple again refreshed its iPod line of MP3 players by introducing a multi-touch iPod Nano, an iPod Touch with FaceTime, and an iPod Shuffle that brought back the clickwheel buttons of earlier generations.[126] It also introduced the smaller, cheaper second generation Apple TV which allowed renting of movies and shows.[127]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2011, Jobs announced in an internal Apple memo that he would take another medical leave of absence for an indefinite period to allow him to focus on his health. Chief operating officer Tim Cook assumed Jobs's day-to-day operations at Apple, although Jobs would still remain \"involved in major strategic decisions\".[128] Apple became the most valuable consumer-facing brand in the world.[129] In June 2011, Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled iCloud, an online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files, and software which replaced MobileMe, Apple's previous attempt at content syncing.[130] This would be the last product launch Jobs would attend before his death.\n\n\nOn August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned his position as CEO of Apple.[131] He was replaced by Cook and Jobs became Apple's chairman. Apple did not have a chairman at the time[132] and instead had two co-lead directors, Andrea Jung and Arthur D. Levinson,[133] who continued with those titles until Levinson replaced Jobs as chairman of the board in November after Jobs' death.[134]\n\n\n\n### 2011–present: Post-Jobs era, Tim Cook[edit]\n\n\nOn October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs died, marking the end of an era for Apple.[135] The next major product announcement by Apple was on January 19, 2012, when Apple's Phil Schiller introduced iBook's Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City.[136] Jobs stated in the biography \"Steve Jobs\" that he wanted to reinvent the textbook industry and education.[137]\n\n\nFrom 2011 to 2012, Apple released the iPhone 4S[138] and iPhone 5,[139] which featured improved cameras, an intelligent software assistant named Siri, and cloud-synced data with iCloud; the third- and fourth-generation iPads, which featured Retina displays;[140][141] and the iPad Mini, which featured a 7.9-inch screen in contrast to the iPad's 9.7-inch screen.[142] These launches were successful, with the iPhone 5 (released September 21, 2012) becoming Apple's biggest iPhone launch with over two million pre-orders[143] and sales of three million iPads in three days following the launch of the iPad Mini and fourth-generation iPad (released November 3, 2012).[144] Apple also released a third-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display and new iMac and Mac Mini computers.[141][142][145]\n\n\nOn August 20, 2012, Apple's rising stock price increased the company's market capitalization to a then-record $624 billion. This beat the non-inflation-adjusted record for market capitalization previously set by Microsoft in 1999.[146] On August 24, 2012, a US jury ruled that Samsung should pay Apple $1.05 billion (£665m) in damages in an intellectual property lawsuit.[147] Samsung appealed the damages award, which was reduced by $450 million[148] and further granted Samsung's request for a new trial.[148] On November 10, 2012, Apple confirmed a global settlement that dismissed all existing lawsuits between Apple and HTC up to that date, in favor of a ten-year license agreement for current and future patents between the two companies.[149] It is predicted that Apple will make $280 million per year from this deal with HTC.[150]\n\n\nIn May 2014, the company confirmed its intent to acquire Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine's audio company Beats Electronics—producer of the \"Beats by Dr. Dre\" line of headphones and speaker products, and operator of the music streaming service Beats Music—for $3 billion, and to sell their products through Apple's retail outlets and resellers. Iovine believed that Beats had always \"belonged\" with Apple, as the company modeled itself after Apple's \"unmatched ability to marry culture and technology.\" The acquisition was the largest purchase in Apple's history.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)Apple Watch first generation (2015)\nDuring a press event on September 9, 2014, Apple introduced a smartwatch, the Apple Watch.[152] Initially, Apple marketed the device as a fashion accessory[153] and a complement to the iPhone, that would allow people to look at their smartphones less.[154] Over time, the company has focused on developing health and fitness-oriented features on the watch, in an effort to compete with dedicated activity trackers.\n\n\nIn January 2016, it was announced that one billion Apple devices were in active use worldwide.[155]\n\n\nOn June 6, 2016, *Fortune* released Fortune 500, its list of companies ranked on revenue generation. In the trailing fiscal year of 2015, Apple was listed as the top tech company.[156] It ranked third, overall, with $233 billion in revenue.[156] This represents a movement upward of two spots from the previous year's list.[156]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Apple announced the HomePod, its smart speaker aimed to compete against Sonos, Google Home, and Amazon Echo.[157] Towards the end of the year, *TechCrunch* reported that Apple was acquiring Shazam, a company that introduced its products at WWDC and specializing in music, TV, film and advertising recognition.[158] The acquisition was confirmed a few days later, reportedly costing Apple $400 million, with media reports that the purchase looked like a move to acquire data and tools bolstering the Apple Music streaming service.[159] The purchase was approved by the European Union in September 2018.[160]\n\n\nAlso in June 2017, Apple appointed Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg to head the newly formed worldwide video unit. In November 2017, Apple announced it was branching out into original scripted programming: a drama series starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, and a reboot of the anthology series Amazing Stories with Steven Spielberg.[161] In June 2018, Apple signed the Writers Guild of America's minimum basic agreement and Oprah Winfrey to a multi-year content partnership.[162] Additional partnerships for original series include Sesame Workshop and DHX Media and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide, as well as a partnership with A24 to create original films.[163]\n\n\nDuring the Apple Special Event in September 2017, the AirPower wireless charger was announced alongside the iPhone X, 8 and Watch Series 3. The AirPower was intended to wirelessly charge multiple devices, simultaneously. Though initially set to release in early 2018, the AirPower would be canceled in March 2019, marking the first cancellation of a device under Cook's leadership.[164]\n\n\nOn August 19, 2020, Apple's share price briefly topped $467.77, making it the first US company with a market capitalization of $2 trillion.[165]\n\n\n\n![](image)MacBook Air M1 (2020)\nDuring its annual WWDC keynote speech on June 22, 2020, Apple announced it would move away from Intel processors, and the Mac would transition to processors developed in-house.[166] The announcement was expected by industry analysts, and it has been noted that Macs featuring Apple's processors would allow for big increases in performance over current Intel-based models.[167] On November 10, 2020, the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and the Mac Mini became the first Mac devices powered by an Apple-designed processor, the Apple M1.[168]\n\n\nIn April 2022, it was reported that Samsung Electro-Mechanics would be collaborating with Apple on its M2 chip instead of LG Innotek.[169] Developer logs showed that at least nine Mac models with four different M2 chips were being tested.[170]\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that an effort to develop its own chips left Apple better prepared to deal with the semiconductor shortage that emerged during the pandemic era and led to increased profitability, with sales of Mac computers that included M1 chips rising sharply in 2020 and 2021. It also inspired other companies like Tesla, Amazon, and Meta Platforms to pursue a similar path.[171]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Apple opened an online store that allowed anyone in the US to view repair manuals and order replacement parts for specific recent iPhones, although the difference in cost between this method and official repair is anticipated to be minimal.[172]\n\n\nIn May 2022, a trademark was filed for RealityOS, an operating system reportedly intended for virtual and augmented reality headsets, first mentioned in 2017. According to Bloomberg, the headset may come out in 2023.[173] Further insider reports state that the device uses iris scanning for payment confirmation and signing into accounts.[174]\n\n\nOn June 18, 2022, the Apple Store in Towson, Maryland became the first to unionize in the U.S., with the employees voting to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.[175]\n\n\nOn July 7, 2022, Apple added Lockdown Mode to macOS 13 and iOS 16, as a response to the earlier Pegasus revelations; the mode increases security protections for high-risk users against targeted zero-day malware.[176]\n\n\nApple launched a buy now, pay later service called 'Apple Pay Later' for its Apple Wallet users in March 2023. The program allows its users to apply for loans between $50 and $1,000 to make online or in-app purchases and then repaying them through four installments spread over six weeks without any interest or fees.[177][178]\n\n\n\n## Products[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Apple Inc. products.\n\n### Mac[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac (computer)\n![A MacBook Air, in midnight color, on a wooden desk.](image)\nMacBook Air with M2 chip\n![An thin iMac in blue color on a desk.](image)\niMac with M1 chip\n\nThe Mac is Apple's family of personal computers. Macs are known for their ease of use[179] and distinctive aluminium, minimalist designs. Macs have been popular among students, creative professionals, and software engineers. The current lineup consists of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops, and the iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio and Mac Pro desktop computers.\n\n\nOften described as a walled garden, Macs use Apple silicon chips, run the macOS operating system, and include Apple software like the Safari web browser, iMovie for home movie editing, GarageBand for music creation, and the iWork productivity suite. Apple also sells pro apps: Final Cut Pro for video production, Logic Pro for musicians and producers, and Xcode for software developers.\n\n\nApple also sells a variety of accessories for Macs, including the Pro Display XDR, Apple Studio Display, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard.\n\n\n\n### iPhone[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iPhone\n\n![An iPhone 14 Pro with Chinese user interface, held by a customer, screen facing the camera](image)iPhone 14 Pro\nThe iPhone is Apple's line of smartphones, which run the iOS operating system. The first iPhone was unveiled by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, new models have been released annually. When it was introduced, its multi-touch screen was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry. The device has been credited with creating the app economy.\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the iPhone has 15% market share, yet represents 50% of global smartphone revenues, with Android phones accounting for the rest.[180][181] The iPhone has generated large profits for the company, and is credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.[182]\n\n\n\n### iPad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iPad\n\nThe iPad is Apple's line of tablets which run iPadOS. The first-generation iPad was announced on January 27, 2010. The iPad is mainly marketed for consuming multimedia, creating art, working on documents, videoconferencing, and playing games. The iPad lineup consists of several base iPad models, and the smaller iPad Mini, upgraded iPad Air, and high-end iPad Pro. Apple has consistently improved the iPad's performance, with the iPad Pro adopting the same M1 and M2 chips as the Mac; but the iPad still receives criticism for its limited OS.[183][184]\n\n\nAs of September 2020,[update] Apple has sold more than 500 million iPads, though sales peaked in 2013.[185] The iPad still remains the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2020[update],[186] and accounted for nine percent of the company's revenue as of the end of 2021[update].[1]\n\n\nApple sells several iPad accessories, including the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, Smart Keyboard Folio, Magic Keyboard, and several adapters.\n\n\n\n### Other products[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nAirPods Max\n![](image)\nApple Watch Ultra\n\nApple makes several other products that it categorizes as \"Wearables, Home and Accessories\".[187] These products include the AirPods line of wireless headphones, Apple TV digital media players, Apple Watch smartwatches, Beats headphones and HomePod Mini smart speakers.\n\n\nAs of the end of 2021[update], this broad line of products comprises about 11% of the company's revenues.[1]\n\n\nAt WWDC 2023, Apple introduced its new VR headset, Vision Pro, along with visionOS.[188] Apple announced that it will be partnering with Unity to bring existing 3D apps to Vision Pro using Unity's PolySpatial technology.[189][190][191][192]\n\n\n\n### Services[edit]\n\n\nApple offers a broad line of services, including advertising in the App Store and Apple News app, the AppleCare+ extended warranty plan, the iCloud+ cloud-based data storage service, payment services through the Apple Card credit card and the Apple Pay processing platform, digital content services including Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and the iTunes Store.\n\n\nAs of the end of 2021[update], services comprise about 19% of the company's revenue.[1] Many of the services have been launched as of 2019[update] when Apple announced it would be making a concerted effort to expand its service revenues.[193]\n\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Marketing of Apple Inc.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Marketing of Apple Inc..** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Branding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first official logo of Apple Inc. was used from 1977 to 1998.[194]\nAccording to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet. Jobs thought the name \"Apple\" was \"fun, spirited and not intimidating\".[195] Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were fans of the Beatles,[196] but Apple Inc. had name and logo trademark issues with Apple Corps Ltd., a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1968. This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with the settling of their lawsuit in 2007.[197]\n\n\nApple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's \"rainbow Apple\", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it.[198] On August 27, 1999,[199] Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation.[200]\n\n\nApple evangelists were actively engaged by the company at one time, but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established. Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism \"something that was stumbled upon,\"[201] while Ive claimed in 2014 that \"people have an incredibly personal relationship\" with Apple's products.[84]\n\n\n*Fortune* magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008, and in the world from 2008 to 2012.[202] On September 30, 2013, Apple surpassed Coca-Cola to become the world's most valuable brand in the Omnicom Group's \"Best Global Brands\" report.[203] Boston Consulting Group has ranked Apple as the world's most innovative brand every year as of 2005[update].[204]\n\n\nAs of January 2021,[update] 1.65 billion Apple products were in active use.[205][206] In February 2023 that number exceeded 2 billion devices.[207][208]\n\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Inc. advertising\n\nApple's first slogan, \"Byte into an Apple\", was coined in the late 1970s.[209] From 1997 to 2002, the slogan \"Think different\" was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple.[210] Apple also has slogans for specific product lines—for example, \"iThink, therefore iMac\" was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,[211] and \"Say hello to iPhone\" has been used in iPhone advertisements.[212] \"Hello\" was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, Newton, iMac (\"hello (again)\"), and iPod.[213]\n\n\nFrom the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, with the 1984 Super Bowl advertisement to the more modern Get a Mac adverts, Apple has been recognized for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products. However, claims made by later campaigns were criticized,[214] particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads.[215] Apple's product advertisements gained significant attention as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.[216] Musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on Apple advertisements include Canadian singer Feist with the song \"1234\" and Yael Naïm with the song \"New Soul\".[216]\n\n\n\n### Stores[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Store\n\n![](image)Apple Fifth Avenue is the flagship store in New York City.\n![](image)A Genius Bar is at Apple's Regent Street store in London.\nThe first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs,[91] after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts.[93] Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired Ron Johnson in 2000.[93] Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997,[217] and opened the first two physical stores in 2001.[91] The media initially speculated that Apple would fail,[94] but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.[94]\n\n\nOver the years, Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage, with 499 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of December 2017[update].[95] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.[218] Apple Stores underwent a period of significant redesign, beginning in May 2016. This redesign included physical changes to the Apple Stores, such as open spaces and re-branded rooms, as well as changes in function to facilitate interaction between consumers and professionals.[219]\n\n\nMany Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone \"flagship\" stores in high-profile locations.[93] It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores' designs and construction, specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes.[220] The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have lost traffic, control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores.[221] Due to the popularity of the brand, Apple receives a large number of job applications, many of which come from young workers.[218] Although Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts,[218] there are limited or no paths of career advancement.[218]\n\n\n\n### Market power[edit]\n\n\nOn March 16, 2020, France fined Apple €1.1 billion for colluding with two wholesalers to stifle competition and keep prices high by handicapping independent resellers. The arrangement created aligned prices for Apple products such as iPads and personal computers for about half the French retail market. According to the French regulators, the abuses occurred between 2005 and 2017 but were first discovered after a complaint by an independent reseller, eBizcuss, in 2012.[222]\n\n\nOn August 13, 2020, Epic Games, the maker of the popular game *Fortnite*, sued Apple and Google after its hugely popular video game was removed from Apple and Google's App Store. The suits came after both Apple and Google blocked the game after it introduced a direct payment system, effectively shutting out the tech titans from collecting fees.[223] In September 2020, Epic Games founded the Coalition for App Fairness together with thirteen other companies, which aims for better conditions for the inclusion of apps in the app stores.[224] Later, in December 2020, Facebook agreed to assist Epic in their legal game against Apple, planning to support the company by providing materials and documents to Epic. Facebook had, however, stated that the company would not participate directly with the lawsuit, although did commit to helping with the discovery of evidence relating to the trial of 2021. In the months prior to their agreement, Facebook had been dealing with feuds against Apple relating to the prices of paid apps as well as privacy rule changes.[225] Head of ad products for Facebook Dan Levy commented, saying that \"this is not really about privacy for them, this is about an attack on personalized ads and the consequences it's going to have on small-business owners,\" commenting on the full-page ads placed by Facebook in various newspapers in December 2020.[226]\n\n\n\n### Customer privacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)PRISM: a clandestine surveillance program under which the NSA collects user data from companies like Facebook and Apple[227]\nApple has a pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and settings part of its conferences, promotional campaigns, and public image.[228] With its iOS 8 mobile operating system in 2014, the company started encrypting all contents of iOS devices through users' passcodes, making it impossible at the time for the company to provide customer data to law enforcement requests seeking such information.[229] With the popularity rise of cloud storage solutions, Apple began a technique in 2016 to do deep learning scans for facial data in photos on the user's local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apple's iCloud storage system.[230] It also introduced \"differential privacy\", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual users anonymous, in a system that *Wired* described as \"trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning as little as possible about any individual in it\".[231] Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate, and can actively opt-in or opt-out.[232]\n\n\nWith Apple's release of an update to iOS 14, Apple required all developers of iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch applications to directly ask iPhone users permission to track them. The feature, titled \"App Tracking Transparency\", received heavy criticism from Facebook, whose primary business model revolves around the tracking of users' data and sharing such data with advertisers so users can see more relevant ads, a technique commonly known as targeted advertising. Despite Facebook's measures, including purchasing full-page newspaper advertisements protesting App Tracking Transparency, Apple released the update in mid-spring 2021. A study by Verizon subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only 4% of iOS users in the United States and 12% worldwide have opted into tracking.[233]\n\n\nHowever, Apple aids law enforcement in criminal investigations by providing iCloud backups of users' devices,[234] and the company's commitment to privacy has been questioned by its efforts to promote biometric authentication technology in its newer iPhone models, which do not have the same level of constitutional privacy as a passcode in the United States.[235]\n\n\nPrior to the release of iOS 15, Apple announced new efforts at combating child sexual abuse material on iOS and Mac platforms. Parents of minor iMessage users can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs. Additionally, on-device hashing would take place on media destined for upload to iCloud, and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement; if enough matches were found, Apple would be alerted and authorities informed. The new features received praise from law enforcement and victims rights advocates, however privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, condemned the new features as invasive and highly prone to abuse by authoritarian governments.[236]\n\n\nIreland's Data Protection Commission launched a privacy investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EU's GDPR law following an investigation into how the company processes personal data with targeted ads on its platform.[237]\n\n\nIn December 2019, a report found that the iPhone 11 Pro continues tracking location and collecting user data even after users have disabled location services. In response, an Apple engineer said the Location Services icon \"appears for system services that do not have a switch in settings.\"[238]\n\n\nAccording to published reports by Bloomberg News on March 30, 2022, Apple turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, an Apple representative referred the reporter to a section of the company policy for law enforcement guidelines, which stated, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[239]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple, Braeburn Capital, and FileMaker\n\n### Business trends[edit]\n\n\nThe key trends for Apple are (as of the financial year ending September 24):[240][241]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | 2011\n | 2012\n | 2013\n | 2014\n | 2015\n | 2016\n | 2017\n | 2018\n | 2019\n | 2020\n | 2021\n | 2022\n | 2023\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue figures\n |\n| Total revenue (US$ b)[242] | 108\n | 156\n | 170\n | 182\n | 233\n | 215\n | 229\n | 265\n | 260\n | 274\n | 365\n | 394\n | 383\n |\n| - iPhone revenue (US$ b)\n | 45.9\n | 78.6\n | 91.2\n | 101\n | 155\n | 136\n | 139\n | 164\n | 142\n | 137\n | 191\n | 205\n | 200\n |\n| - Mac revenue (US$ b)\n | 21.7\n | 23.2\n | 21.4\n | 24.0\n | 25.4\n | 22.8\n | 25.5\n | 25.1\n | 25.7\n | 28.6\n | 35.1\n | 40.1\n | 29.3\n |\n| - iPad revenue (US$ b)\n | 19.1\n | 30.9\n | 31.9\n | 30.2\n | 23.2\n | 20.6\n | 18.8\n | 18.3\n | 21.2\n | 23.7\n | 31.8\n | 29.2\n | 28.3\n |\n| - Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue (US$ b)\n | 11.9\n | 10.7\n | 10.1\n | 8.3\n | 10.0\n | 11.1\n | 12.8\n | 17.3\n | 24.4\n | 30.6\n | 38.3\n | 41.2\n | 39.8\n |\n| - Services revenue (US$ b)\n | 9.3\n | 12.8\n | 16.0\n | 18.0\n | 19.9\n | 24.3\n | 32.7\n | 39.7\n | 46.2\n | 53.7\n | 68.4\n | 78.1\n | 85.2\n |\n| Non-revenue figures\n |\n| Net profit (US$ b)[243] | 25.9\n | 41.7\n | 37.0\n | 39.5\n | 53.3\n | 45.6\n | 48.3\n | 59.3\n | 55.2\n | 57.4\n | 94.6\n | 99.8\n | 96.9\n |\n| Number of employees (k, FTE)\n | 60.4\n | 72.8\n | 80.3\n | 92.6\n | 110\n | 116\n | 123\n | 132\n | 137\n | 147\n | 154\n | 164\n | 161\n |\n| References | [244] | [245] | [246] | [247] | [248] | [249] | [250] | [251] | [252] | [253] | [254] | [255] | [256] |\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n#### Senior management[edit]\n\n\nAs of March 16, 2021[update], the management of Apple Inc. includes:[257]\n\n\n\n* Tim Cook (chief executive officer)\n* Jeff Williams (chief operating officer)\n* Luca Maestri (senior vice president and chief financial officer)\n* Katherine L.

Steve Jobs (1997–2011)\n\n\n### Corporate culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Co-founder Steve Wozniak and engineer Andy Hertzfeld attended the Apple User Group Connection club in 1985.\n![](image)Universities with the most alumni at Apple\nApple is one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[258] According to a 2011 report in *Fortune*, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[259] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching *Star Trek* and attending *Star Trek* conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[260]\n\n\nAs the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than others.[261]\n\n\nThe Apple Fellows program awards employees for extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing. Recipients include Bill Atkinson,[262] Steve Capps,[263] Rod Holt,[262] Alan Kay,[264][265] Guy Kawasaki,[264][266] Al Alcorn,[267] Don Norman,[264] Rich Page,[262] Steve Wozniak,[262] and Phil Schiller.[268]\n\n\nAt Apple, employees are intended to be specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise.[*needs update*] Jobs saw this as a means of having \"best-in-class\" employees in every role. For instance, Ron Johnson—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores. This was done by Tim Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management.[269] Apple is known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a \"directly responsible individual\" or \"DRI\" in Apple jargon.[259][270] As an example, when iOS senior vice president Scott Forstall refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned Maps app, he was forced to resign.[271] Unlike other major U.S. companies, Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.[272]\n\n\nIn 2015, Apple had 110,000 full-time employees. This increased to 116,000 full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline. Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail, though its 2014 SEC filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base.[273] In September 2017, Apple announced that it had over 123,000 full-time employees.[274]\n\n\nApple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy, and has an anti-leak Global Security team that recruits from the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Secret Service.[275]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Glassdoor said Apple was the 48th best place to work, having originally entered at rank 19 in 2009, peaking at rank 10 in 2012, and falling down the ranks in subsequent years.[276]\n\n\nIn 2023, *Bloomberg*'s Mark Gurman revealed the existence of Apple's Exploratory Design Group (XDG), which was working to add glucose monitoring to the Apple Watch. Gurman compared XDG to Alphabet's X \"moonshot factory\".[277]\n\n\n\n### Offices[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Apple Park and Apple Campus\n\n![](image)Apple Park is the main headquarters in Cupertino.\nApple Inc.'s world corporate headquarters are located in Cupertino, in the middle of California's Silicon Valley, at Apple Park, a massive circular groundscraper building with a circumference of one mile (1.6 km). The building opened in April 2017 and houses more than 12,000 employees. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs wanted Apple Park to look less like a business park and more like a nature refuge, and personally appeared before the Cupertino City Council in June 2011 to make the proposal, in his final public appearance before his death.\n\n\n\n![](image)The original Apple Campus has the street address 1 Infinite Loop, Sunnyvale, California.\nApple also operates from the Apple Campus (also known by its address, 1 Infinite Loop), a grouping of six buildings in Cupertino that total 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2) located about 1 mile (1.6 km) to the west of Apple Park.[278] The Apple Campus was the company's headquarters from its opening in 1993, until the opening of Apple Park in 2017. The buildings, located at 1–6 Infinite Loop, are arranged in a circular pattern around a central green space, in a design that has been compared to that of a university.\n\n\nIn addition to Apple Park and the Apple Campus, Apple occupies an additional thirty office buildings scattered throughout the city of Cupertino, including three buildings as prior headquarters: Stephens Creek Three from 1977 to 1978, Bandley One from 1978 to 1982, and Mariani One from 1982 to 1993.[279] In total, Apple occupies almost 40% of the available office space in the city.[280]\n\n\nApple's headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are located in Cork in the south of Ireland, called the Hollyhill campus.[281] The facility, which opened in 1980, houses 5,500 people and was Apple's first location outside of the United States.[282] Apple's international sales and distribution arms operate out of the campus in Cork.[283]\n\n\nApple has two campuses near Austin, Texas: a 216,000-square-foot (20,100 m2) campus opened in 2014 houses 500 engineers who work on Apple silicon[284] and a 1.1-million-square-foot (100,000 m2) campus opened in 2021 where 6,000 people work in technical support, supply chain management, online store curation, and Apple Maps data management.\n\n\nThe company also has several other locations in Boulder, Colorado, Culver City, California, Herzliya (Israel), London, New York, Pittsburgh, San Diego, and Seattle that each employ hundreds of people.[285]\n\n\n\n### Litigation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Litigation involving Apple Inc.\n\nApple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.[286] In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include *Apple v. Samsung*, *Apple v. Microsoft*, *Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.*, and *Apple Corps v. Apple Computer*. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights. Most have been dismissed in the courts as shell companies known as patent trolls, with no evidence of actual use of patents in question.[287] On December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S. and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter's products infringe on Nokia's patents.[288] Most recently, in November 2017, the United States International Trade Commission announced an investigation into allegations of patent infringement in regards to Apple's remote desktop technology; Aqua Connect, a company that builds remote desktop software, has claimed that Apple infringed on two of its patents.[289] In January 2022, Ericsson sued Apple over payment of royalty of 5G technology.[290]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple\n\nApple is the world's largest technology company by revenue, the world's largest technology company by total assets,[291] and the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung.[292]\n\n\nIn its fiscal year ending in September 2011, Apple Inc. reported a total of $108 billion in annual revenues—a significant increase from its 2010 revenues of $65 billion—and nearly $82 billion in cash reserves.[293] On March 19, 2012, Apple announced plans for a $2.65-per-share dividend beginning in fourth quarter of 2012, per approval by their board of directors.[294]\n\n\nThe company's worldwide annual revenue in 2013 totaled $170 billion.[295] In May 2013, Apple entered the top ten of the *Fortune* 500 list of companies for the first time, rising 11 places above its 2012 ranking to take the sixth position.[296] As of 2016[update], Apple has around US$234 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which 90% is located outside the United States for tax purposes.[297]\n\n\nApple amassed 65% of all profits made by the eight largest worldwide smartphone manufacturers in quarter one of 2014, according to a report by Canaccord Genuity. In the first quarter of 2015, the company garnered 92% of all earnings.[298]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2017, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple had cash reserves of $250 billion,[299] officially confirmed by Apple as specifically $256.8 billion a few days later.[300]\n\n\nAs of August 3, 2018[update], Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization. On August 2, 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach a $1 trillion market value.[301][302] Apple was ranked No. 4 on the 2018 *Fortune* 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[303]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Apple reported an 11% decline in Q3 profits compared to 2021. Its revenue in the same period rose 2% year-on-year to $83 billion, though this figure was also lower than in 2021, where the increase was at 36%. The general downturn is reportedly caused by the slowing global economy and supply chain disruptions in China.[304]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Apple reported a decline in its sales for the first quarter of 2023. Compared to that of 2022, revenue for 2023 fell by 3%. This is Apple's second consecutive quarter of sales decline. This fall is attributed to the slowing economy and consumers putting off purchases of iPads and computers due to increased pricing. However, iPhone sales held up with a year-on-year increase of 1.5%. According to Apple, demands for such devices were strong, particularly in Latin America and South Asia.[305]\n\n\n\n### Taxes[edit]\n\n\nApple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to *The New York Times*, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the \"Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich\", which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.[306][307]\n\n\nBritish Conservative Party Member of Parliament Charlie Elphicke published research on October 30, 2012,[308] which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard corporate tax rates. He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and The Coca-Cola Company, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.[309]\n\n\nAccording to a US Senate report on the company's offshore tax structure concluded in May 2013, Apple has held billions of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries to pay little or no taxes to any government by using an unusual global tax structure.[310] The main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple's retail stores throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years. \"Apple has exploited a difference between Irish and U.S. tax residency rules\", the report said.[311]\n\n\nOn May 21, 2013, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his company's tax tactics at a Senate hearing.[312]\n\n\nApple says that it is the single largest taxpayer in the U.S., with an effective tax rate of approximately of 26% as of Q2 FY2016.[313] In an interview with the German newspaper *FAZ* in October 2017, Tim Cook stated that Apple was the biggest taxpayer worldwide.[314]\n\n\nIn 2016, after a two-year investigation, the European Commission claimed that Apple's use of a hybrid Double Irish tax arrangement constituted \"illegal state aid\" from Ireland, and ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in unpaid taxes, the largest corporate tax fine in history. This was later annulled, after the European General Court ruled that the Commission had provided insufficient evidence.[315][316] In 2018, Apple repatriated $285 billion to America, resulting in a $38 billion tax payment spread over the following 8 years.[317]\n\n\n\n### Charity[edit]\n\n\nApple is a partner of (PRODUCT)RED, a fundraising campaign for AIDS charity. In November 2014, Apple arranged for all App Store revenue in a two-week period to go to the fundraiser,[318] generating more than US$20 million,[319] and in March 2017, it released an iPhone 7 with a red color finish.[320]\n\n\nApple contributes financially to fundraisers in times of natural disasters. In November 2012, it donated $2.5 million to the American Red Cross to aid relief efforts after Hurricane Sandy,[321] and in 2017 it donated $5 million to relief efforts for both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey,[322] as well as for the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake.[323] The company has also used its iTunes platform to encourage donations in the wake of environmental disasters and humanitarian crises, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake,[324] the 2011 Japan earthquake,[325] Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in November 2013,[326] and the 2015 European migrant crisis.[327] Apple emphasizes that it does not incur any processing or other fees for iTunes donations, sending 100% of the payments directly to relief efforts, though it also acknowledges that the Red Cross does not receive any personal information on the users donating and that the payments may not be tax deductible.[328]\n\n\nOn April 14, 2016, Apple and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) announced that they have engaged in a partnership to, \"help protect life on our planet.\" Apple released a special page in the iTunes App Store, Apps for Earth. In the arrangement, Apple has committed that through April 24, WWF will receive 100% of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases. Apple and WWF's Apps for Earth campaign raised more than $8 million in total proceeds to support WWF's conservation work. WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco.[329]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Apple's CEO Cook announced that the company will be donating \"millions\" of masks to health workers in the United States and Europe.[330]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2021, Apple announced a $100 million \"Racial Equity and Justice Initiative\" to help combat institutional racism worldwide.[331][332]\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environmental impact of Apple\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Environmental impact of Apple.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Apple Energy[edit]\n\n\nApple Energy, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple Inc. that sells solar energy. As of June 6, 2016[update], Apple's solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity.[333] In addition to the company's solar energy production, Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a landfill gas energy plant in North Carolina. Apple will use the methane emissions to generate electricity.[334] Apple's North Carolina data center is already powered entirely with energy from renewable sources.[335]\n\n\n\n### Energy and resources[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category \"Striding\".[336] This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a \"stuck icon\", adding that Apple at the time was \"a choice to avoid for the climate-conscious consumer\".[337]\n\n\nFollowing a Greenpeace protest, Apple released a statement on April 17, 2012, committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100% renewable clean energy.[338][339] By 2013, Apple was using 100% renewable energy to power their data centers. Overall, 75% of the company's power came from clean renewable sources.[340]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying, \"Apple's commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry, illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100% renewable Internet is within its reach, and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet.\"[341]\n\n\nAs of 2016[update], Apple states that 100% of its U.S. operations run on renewable energy, 100% of Apple's data centers run on renewable energy and 93% of Apple's global operations run on renewable energy.[342] However, the facilities are connected to the local grid which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources, so Apple carbon offsets its electricity use.[343] The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment. Each product receives a Gold, Silver, or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability. Every Apple tablet, notebook, desktop computer, and display that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating, the highest possible. Although Apple's data centers recycle water 35 times,[344] the increased activity in retail, corporate and data centers also increase the amount of water use to 573 million US gal (2.2 million m3) in 2015.[345]\n\n\nDuring an event on March 21, 2016, Apple provided a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable in all of its worldwide operations. Lisa P. Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016[update], 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from post-consumer recycled paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products.[346] Apple working in partnership with Conservation Fund, have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in Maine and North Carolina. Another partnership announced is with the World Wildlife Fund to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres (4,000 km2) of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 MW solar power plant in the Sichuan province of China that was tailor-made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In Singapore, Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones. Reuses and recycles parts from traded in products.[347]\n\n\nApple announced on August 16, 2016, that Lens Technology, one of its major suppliers in China, has committed to power all its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by 2018. The commitment is a large step in Apple's efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China.[348] Apple also announced that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL's Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The standard, which started in January 2015, certifies that all manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or converted into energy (when necessary). Since the program began, nearly 140,000 metric tons of waste have been diverted from landfills.[349]\n\n\nOn July 21, 2020, Apple announced its plan to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. In the next 10 years, Apple will try to lower emissions with a series of innovative actions, including: low carbon product design, expanding energy efficiency, renewable energy, process and material innovations, and carbon removal.[350]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Apple said that it had started a $200 million fund in order to combat climate change by removing 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year.[351]\n\n\nIn February 2022, the NewClimate Institute, a German environmental policy think tank, published a survey evaluating the transparency and progress of the climate strategies and carbon neutrality pledges announced by 25 major companies in the United States that found that Apple's carbon neutrality pledge and climate strategy was unsubstantiated and misleading.[352][353]\n\n\n\n### Toxins[edit]\n\n\nFollowing further campaigns by Greenpeace,[354] in 2008, Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to eliminate all polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in its complete product line.[355] In June 2007, Apple began replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCD displays in its computers with mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass, starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro.[356][357][358][359] Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO2e, emissions, materials, and electrical usage concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which they have enough data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage. Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale.[360] In June 2009, Apple's iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs.[356][361] All Apple products now have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables. All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product's respective regulatory category.[356][362]\n\n\nIn November 2011, Apple was featured in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how \"green\" their products are. The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10.[363] Greenpeace praised Apple's sustainability, noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. Apple continues to score well on product ratings, with all of their products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticized Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data, and for not setting any targets to reduce emissions.[364] In January 2012, Apple requested that its cable maker, Volex, begin producing halogen-free USB and power cables.[365]\n\n\n\n### Green bonds[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2016, Apple issued a $1.5 billion green bond (climate bond), the first ever of its kind by a U.S. tech company. The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects.[366]\n\n\n\n## Supply chain[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple supply chain\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Apple supply chain.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\nApple products were made in America in Apple-owned factories until the late 1990s; however, as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by *The New York Times*, Apple insiders \"believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that \"Made in the USA\" is no longer a viable option for most Apple products\".[367]\n\n\nThe company's manufacturing, procurement, and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: \"Nobody wants to buy sour milk.\"[368][369]\n\n\nIn May 2017, the company announced a $1 billion funding project for \"advanced manufacturing\" in the United States,[370] and subsequently invested $200 million in Corning Inc., a manufacturer of toughened Gorilla Glass technology used in its iPhone devices.[371] The following December, Apple's chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, told *CNBC* that the \"$1 billion\" amount was \"absolutely not\" the final limit on its spending, elaborating that \"We're not thinking in terms of a fund limit... We're thinking about, where are the opportunities across the U.S. to help nurture companies that are making the advanced technology— and the advanced manufacturing that goes with that— that quite frankly is essential to our innovation.\"[372]\n\n\nAs of 2021[update], Apple uses components from 43 countries.[373] The majority of assembling is done by Taiwanese original design manufacturer firms Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics with factories mostly located inside China,[374] but also Brazil,[375] and India.[376]\n\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., (TSMC) is a pure-play semiconductor manufacturing company. They make the majority of Apple's smartphone SoCs, with Samsung Semiconductor, playing a minority role.[377] Apple, alone accounted for over 25% of TSMC's total income in 2021.[378] Apple's Bionic lineup of smartphone SoCs, are currently made exclusively by TSMC[379] from the A7 bionic onwards, previously manufacturing was shared with Samsung. The M series of Apple SoC for consumer computers and tablets is made by TSMC as well.[380]\n\n\nDuring the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.[381] This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the PCI bus in the 7500/8500/9500 Power Macs. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as USB, AGP, HyperTransport, Wi-Fi, NVMe, PCIe and others in its products. FireWire is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as IEEE 1394 and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.[382]\n\n\nApple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO Tim Cook said that he \"[loves] India\", but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region.[383] India's requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as \"really adds cost to getting product to market\".[384] In May 2016, Apple opened an iOS app development center in Bangalore and a maps development office for 4,000 staff in Hyderabad.[385] In March, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India \"over the next two months\",[386] and in May, the *Journal* wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of iPhone SE in the country,[387] while Apple told *CNBC* that the manufacturing was for a \"small number\" of units.[388] In April 2019, Apple initiated manufacturing of iPhone 7 at its Bengaluru facility, keeping in mind demand from local customers even as they seek more incentives from the government of India.[389] At the beginning of 2020, Tim Cook announced that Apple schedules the opening of its first physical outlet in India for 2021, while an online store is to be launched by the end of the year.[390]\n\n\nDuring the 2022 COVID-19 protests in China, Chinese state-owned company Wingtech was reported by *The Wall Street Journal* to gain an additional foothold in Apple's supply chain following protests at a Foxconn factory in the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone.[391]\n\n\n\n### Worker organizations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple and unions\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Apple and unions.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\nIn 2006, one complex of factories in Shenzhen, China that assembled the iPod and other items had over 200,000 workers living and working within it. Employees regularly worked more than 60 hours per week and made around $100 per month. A little over half of the workers' earnings was required to pay for rent and food from the company.[392][393]\n\n\nApple immediately launched an investigation after the 2006 media report, and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions.[394] In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding worker's rights, slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply. Yearly progress reports have been published as of 2008[update].[395] In 2011, Apple admitted that its suppliers' child labor practices in China had worsened.[396]\n\n\nThe Foxconn suicides occurred between January and November 2010, when 18 Foxconn (Chinese: 富士康) employees attempted suicide,[397] resulting in 14 deaths—the company was the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, for clients including Apple, at the time.[397][398][399] The suicides drew media attention, and employment practices at Foxconn were investigated by Apple.[400] Apple issued a public statement about the suicides, and company spokesperson Steven Dowling said:\n\n\n\n\n> [Apple is] saddened and upset by the recent suicides at Foxconn ... A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made.[401]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe statement was released after the results from the company's probe into its suppliers' labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple's own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories.[401] Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.[402]\n\n\nAlso in 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.[403] After a high suicide rate in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit a lower rate than that of China as a whole,[404] workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves.[405] Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to hexane, a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.[406]\n\n\nA 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing as of 2010[update], Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: \"We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions\".[402]\n\n\nIn December 2014, the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in \"primitive, dark and filthy dorms\" where they sleep \"on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room.\" Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.[407]\n\n\nIn 2019, there were reports stating that some of Foxconn's managers had used rejected parts to build iPhones and that Apple was investigating the issue.[408]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Apple Inc. media events\n* Pixar\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Apple 10-K Report FY2021\" (PDF).

As of March 2023[update], Apple is the world's biggest company by market capitalization,[6] and with US$394.3 billion the largest technology company by 2022 revenue.[7] As of June 2022[update], Apple is the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales; the largest manufacturing company by revenue; and the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\n\nApple was founded as **Apple Computer Company** on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as **Apple Computer, Inc.** in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called \"1984\". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\n\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\n\n\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then at $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022. In June 2023, it was valued at just over $3 trillion.[8] The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It has also been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Apple Inc.\n\n### 1976–1980: Founding and incorporation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Apple Inc. § 1971–1985: Jobs and Wozniak\n\n![](image)In 1976, Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in his parents' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California.[9] Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak called the popular belief that the company was founded in the garage \"a bit of a myth\".[10] They moved some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded.[11]\n![](image)The Apple I is Apple's first product, designed by Steve Wozniak and sold as an assembled circuit board without basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case. This unit received an aftermarket keyboard and a wooden case.\n![](image)The Apple II Plus was introduced in 1979, designed primarily by Wozniak.\nApple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership.[9][12] The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[13] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.[14]: 57 Neither received the full selling price but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2023). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[15] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer.[16] It went on sale soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,600 in 2023).[17][18]: 180 Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked \"repeating digits\".[19]\n\n\nApple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[20][21] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded it.[22] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 (equivalent to $1,257,000 in 2023) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[23] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[24]\n\n\nThe Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire.[25] It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. While the Apple I and early Apple II models used ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978.[26][27]\n\n\nThe Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first \"killer application\" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979.[26] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office,[26] but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari, Commodore, and Tandy.[28][29]\n\n\nOn December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol \"AAPL\") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September 3, 2022[update]),[21] generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[30] By the end of the day, 300 millionaires were created, from a stock price of $29 per share[31] and a market cap of $1.778 billion.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### 1980–1990: Success with Macintosh[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Mac models and Timeline of the Apple II family\n\n![](image)The Macintosh, released in 1984, is the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral graphical user interface and mouse.\nA critical moment in the company's history came in December 1979 when Jobs and several Apple employees, including human–computer interface expert Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC in to see a demonstration of the Xerox Alto, a computer using a graphical user interface. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000[32] shares (22.4 million split-adjusted shares as of September 3, 2022[update])[21] of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.[33] After the demonstration, Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface, and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa, named after Jobs's daughter.[34]\n\n\nThe Lisa division was plagued by infighting, and in 1982, Jobs was pushed off the project. The Lisa launched in 1983 and became the first mass marketed personal computer with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price and limited software library.[35]\n\n\nJobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's Macintosh division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.[36] Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.[37]\n\n\nIn 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer without a bundled programming language.[38] Its debut was signified by \"1984\", a $1.5 million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.[39] This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success[40] and was called a \"masterpiece\" by CNN[41] and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by *TV Guide*.[42]\n\n\nThe advertisement created great interest in Macintosh, and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in. Jobs had required 128 kilobytes of RAM, which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of $1,000 (equivalent to $2,900 in 2023). The Macintosh shipped for $2,495 (equivalent to $7,300 in 2023), a price panned by critics due to its slow performance.[43]: 195 In early 1985, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired away from Pepsi two years earlier by Jobs[44] saying, \"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?\"[45] Sculley removed Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division, with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[46]\n\n\nThe board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from leadership.[47] Jean-Louis Gassée informed Sculley that Jobs had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup and called an emergency meeting at which Apple's executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.[47] Jobs resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took several Apple employees with him to found NeXT.[48] Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in 1985 to pursue other ventures, expressing his frustration with Apple's treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years\".[37][49][50] Wozniak remained employed by Apple as a representative,[49] receiving a stipend estimated to be $120,000 per year.[18] Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders after their departures.[51]\n\n\nAfter the departures of Jobs and Wozniak in 1985, Sculley launched the Macintosh 512K that year with quadruple the RAM, and introduced the LaserWriter, the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer. PageMaker, an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language, was also released by Aldus Corporation in July 1985.[52] It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh, LaserWriter, and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.[53]\n\n\nThis dominant position in the desktop publishing market[54] allowed the company to focus on higher price points, the so-called \"high-right policy\" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin, and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in speed. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, due to Jean-Louis Gassée's slogan of \"fifty-five or die\", referring to the 55% profit margins of the Macintosh II.[55]: 79–80\n\n\nThis policy began to backfire late in the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on IBM PC compatibles that offered some of the same functionality of the Macintosh at far lower price points. The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.[55]: 117–129 During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer.[56] Gassée left the company later that year.[57]\n\n\n\n### 1990–1997: Decline and restructuring[edit]\n\n\nThe company pivoted strategy and in October 1990 introduced three lower-cost models, the Macintosh Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.[58] In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.\n\n\n\nThe success of the lower-cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue.[59] For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine *MacAddict* named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh.[60]\n\n![](image)The PenLite is Apple's first tablet computer prototype, created in 1992 to bring the Mac OS to a tablet. It was canceled in favor of the Newton.[61]\nThe success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to the cannibalization of higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points, aimed at different markets: the high-end Quadra series, the mid-range Centris series, and the consumer-marketed Performa series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between so many models.[62]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Apple II series was discontinued, which was expensive to produce, and the company decided was still taking sales away from lower-cost Macintosh models. After the launch of the LC, Apple began encouraging developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to direct consumers away from Apple II and toward Macintosh.[63] The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.[64]\n\n\nApple also experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including digital cameras, portable CD audio players, speakers, video game consoles, the eWorld online service, and TV appliances. Enormous resources were invested in the problem-plagued Newton tablet division, based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.[65]\n\n\nThroughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.[66] Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; instead, they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the Apple Lisa in *Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.*[67] The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed.\n\n\nThe major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apple's reputation, and in 1993 Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler.[68]\n\n\nWith Spindler at the helm, Apple, IBM, and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in 1994 with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform; PReP), which used IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows. That year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh, the first of many computers with Motorola's PowerPC processor.[69]\n\n\nIn the wake of the alliance, Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build Macintosh clones. Over the next two years, 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced. However, by 1996, Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of their own high-end computers, where profit margins were highest.[70]\n\n\nIn 1996, Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO. Hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator, Amelio made deep changes, including extensive layoffs and cost-cutting.[71]\n\n\nThis period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system (MacOS). The original Macintosh operating system (System 1) was not built for multitasking (running several applications at once). The company attempted to correct this with by introducing cooperative multitasking in System 5, but the company still felt it needed a more modern approach.[72] This led to the Pink project in 1988, A/UX that same year, Copland in 1994, and the attempted purchase of BeOS in 1996. Talks with Be stalled when the CEO, former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée, demanded $300 million instead of the $125 million Apple wanted to pay.[73]\n\n\nOnly weeks away from bankruptcy,[74] Apple's board decided NeXTSTEP was a better choice for its next operating system and purchased NeXT in late 1996 for $400 million, bringing back Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.[75]\n\n\n\n### 1997–2007: Return to profitability[edit]\n\n\nThe NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997,[76] and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses.\n\n\nThe board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately began a review of the company's products. Jobs would order 70% of the company's products to be cancelled, resulting in the loss of 3,000 jobs, and taking Apple back to the core of its computer offerings.[77] The next month, in August 1997, Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a $150 million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing software for the Mac.[78] The investment was seen as an \"antitrust insurance policy\" for Microsoft who had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti-competitive practices.[79] Jobs also ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker, Power Computing.[80] On November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the Apple Store website, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing that had been successfully used by PC manufacturer Dell.[81]\n\n\nThe moves paid off for Jobs; at the end of his first year as CEO, the company turned a $309 million profit.[77]\n\n\n\n![](image)\niMac\n![](image)\niBook\n![](image)\nPower Macintosh G3\n![](image)\nPowerBook G3\n\nOn May 6, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh: the iMac. The iMac was a huge success for Apple selling 800,000 units in its first five months[82] and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the 3+1⁄2-inch diskette, being an early adopter of the USB connector, and coming pre-installed with internet connectivity (the \"i\" in iMac)[83] via Ethernet and a dial-up modem. The device also had a striking teardrop shape and translucent materials, designed by Jonathan Ive, who although hired by Amelio, would go on to work collaboratively with Jobs for the next decade to chart a new course the design of Apple's products.[84][85]\n\n\nA little more than a year later on July 21, 1999, Apple introduced the iBook, a laptop for consumers. It was the culmination of a strategy established by Jobs to produce only four products: refined versions of the Power Macintosh G3 desktop and PowerBook G3 laptop for professionals, along with the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers. Jobs felt the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation.[86]\n\n\nAt around the same time, Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers. Apple acquired of Macromedia's Key Grip digital video editing software project which was renamed Final Cut Pro when it was launched on the retail market in April 1999.[87] The development of Key Grip also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product iMovie in October 1999.[88] Next, Apple successfully acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000, which had developed the DVD authoring software DVDirector, which Apple would sell as the professional-oriented DVD Studio Pro software product, and used the same technology to create iDVD for the consumer market.[88] In 2000, Apple purchased the SoundJam MP audio player software from Casady & Greene. Apple renamed the program iTunes, while simplifying the user interface and adding the ability to burn CDs.[89]\n\n\n2001 would be a pivotal year for the Apple with the company making three announcements that would change the course of the company.\n\n\nThe first announcement came on March 24, 2001, that Apple was nearly ready to release a new modern operating system, Mac OS X. The announcement came after numerous failed attempts in the early 1990s, and several years of development. Mac OS X was based on NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, and BSD Unix, with Apple aiming to combine the stability, reliability, and security of Unix with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface, heavily influenced by NeXTSTEP. To aid users in migrating from Mac OS 9, the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 applications within Mac OS X via the Classic Environment.[90]\n\n\nIn May 2001, the company opened its first two Apple Store retail locations in Virginia and California,[91][92] offering an improved presentation of the company's products.[93] At the time, many speculated that the stores would fail,[94] but they went on to become highly successful, and the first of more than 500 stores around the world.[95]\n\n\nOn October 23, 2001, Apple debuted the iPod portable digital audio player. The product, which was first sold on November 10, 2001, was phenomenally successful with over 100 million units sold within six years.[96]\n\n\nIn 2003, Apple's iTunes Store was introduced. The service offered music downloads for 99¢ a song and integration with the iPod. The iTunes Store quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over five billion downloads by June 19, 2008.[97] Two years later, the iTunes Store was the world's largest music retailer.[98]\n\n\nIn 2002, Apple purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositing application Shake,[99] as well as Emagic for the music productivity application Logic. The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company. The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple's consumer-level GarageBand application.[100] The release of iPhoto that year completed the iLife suite.[101]\n\n\n\n![](image)The MacBook Pro is Apple's first laptop with an Intel microprocessor, introduced in 2006.\nAt the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would move away from PowerPC processors, and the Mac would transition to Intel processors in 2006.[102] On January 10, 2006, the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intel's Core Duo CPU. By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced.[102] The Power Mac, iBook, and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the Mac Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.[103] On April 29, 2009, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple was building its own team of engineers to design microchips.[104] Apple also introduced Boot Camp in 2006 to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.[105]\n\n\nApple's success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple's stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80.[106] When Apple surpassed Dell's market cap in January 2006,[107] Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dell's CEO Michael Dell should eat his words.[108] Nine years prior, Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would \"shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders\".[109]\n\n\n\n### 2007–2011: Success with mobile devices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The newly announced iPhone was on display at the 2007 MacWorld Expo.\nDuring his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced the renaming of Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple Inc., because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.[110] This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone[111] and the Apple TV.[112] The company sold 270,000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales,[113] and the device was called \"a game changer for the industry\".[114]\n\n\nIn an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management (DRM), thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players if record labels would agree to drop the technology.[115] On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.[116] Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available without their FairPlay DRM.[117]\n\n\nIn July 2008, Apple launched the App Store to sell third-party applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch.[118] Within a month, the store sold 60 million applications and registered an average daily revenue of $1 million, with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion-dollar business for Apple.[119] By October 2008, Apple was the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.[120]\n\n\nOn January 14, 2009, Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health. In the email, Jobs stated that \"the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well\", and explained that the break would allow the company \"to focus on delivering extraordinary products\".[121] Though Jobs was absent, Apple recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during the recession with revenue of $8.16 billion and profit of $1.21 billion.[122]\n\n\nAfter years of speculation and multiple rumored \"leaks\", Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and all iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, though having very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the U.S. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.[123] In May of the same year, Apple's market cap exceeded that of competitor Microsoft for the first time since 1989.[124]\n\n\nIn June 2010, Apple released the iPhone 4,[125] which introduced video calling using FaceTime, multitasking, and a new uninsulated stainless steel design that acted as the phone's antenna. Later that year, Apple again refreshed its iPod line of MP3 players by introducing a multi-touch iPod Nano, an iPod Touch with FaceTime, and an iPod Shuffle that brought back the clickwheel buttons of earlier generations.[126] It also introduced the smaller, cheaper second generation Apple TV which allowed renting of movies and shows.[127]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2011, Jobs announced in an internal Apple memo that he would take another medical leave of absence for an indefinite period to allow him to focus on his health. Chief operating officer Tim Cook assumed Jobs's day-to-day operations at Apple, although Jobs would still remain \"involved in major strategic decisions\".[128] Apple became the most valuable consumer-facing brand in the world.[129] In June 2011, Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled iCloud, an online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files, and software which replaced MobileMe, Apple's previous attempt at content syncing.[130] This would be the last product launch Jobs would attend before his death.\n\n\nOn August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned his position as CEO of Apple.[131] He was replaced by Cook and Jobs became Apple's chairman. Apple did not have a chairman at the time[132] and instead had two co-lead directors, Andrea Jung and Arthur D. Levinson,[133] who continued with those titles until Levinson replaced Jobs as chairman of the board in November after Jobs' death.[134]\n\n\n\n### 2011–present: Post-Jobs era, Tim Cook[edit]\n\n\nOn October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs died, marking the end of an era for Apple.[135] The next major product announcement by Apple was on January 19, 2012, when Apple's Phil Schiller introduced iBook's Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City.[136] Jobs stated in the biography \"Steve Jobs\" that he wanted to reinvent the textbook industry and education.[137]\n\n\nFrom 2011 to 2012, Apple released the iPhone 4S[138] and iPhone 5,[139] which featured improved cameras, an intelligent software assistant named Siri, and cloud-synced data with iCloud; the third- and fourth-generation iPads, which featured Retina displays;[140][141] and the iPad Mini, which featured a 7.9-inch screen in contrast to the iPad's 9.7-inch screen.[142] These launches were successful, with the iPhone 5 (released September 21, 2012) becoming Apple's biggest iPhone launch with over two million pre-orders[143] and sales of three million iPads in three days following the launch of the iPad Mini and fourth-generation iPad (released November 3, 2012).[144] Apple also released a third-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display and new iMac and Mac Mini computers.[141][142][145]\n\n\nOn August 20, 2012, Apple's rising stock price increased the company's market capitalization to a then-record $624 billion. This beat the non-inflation-adjusted record for market capitalization previously set by Microsoft in 1999.[146] On August 24, 2012, a US jury ruled that Samsung should pay Apple $1.05 billion (£665m) in damages in an intellectual property lawsuit.[147] Samsung appealed the damages award, which was reduced by $450 million[148] and further granted Samsung's request for a new trial.[148] On November 10, 2012, Apple confirmed a global settlement that dismissed all existing lawsuits between Apple and HTC up to that date, in favor of a ten-year license agreement for current and future patents between the two companies.[149] It is predicted that Apple will make $280 million per year from this deal with HTC.[150]\n\n\nIn May 2014, the company confirmed its intent to acquire Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine's audio company Beats Electronics—producer of the \"Beats by Dr. Dre\" line of headphones and speaker products, and operator of the music streaming service Beats Music—for $3 billion, and to sell their products through Apple's retail outlets and resellers. Iovine believed that Beats had always \"belonged\" with Apple, as the company modeled itself after Apple's \"unmatched ability to marry culture and technology.\" The acquisition was the largest purchase in Apple's history.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)Apple Watch first generation (2015)\nDuring a press event on September 9, 2014, Apple introduced a smartwatch, the Apple Watch.[152] Initially, Apple marketed the device as a fashion accessory[153] and a complement to the iPhone, that would allow people to look at their smartphones less.[154] Over time, the company has focused on developing health and fitness-oriented features on the watch, in an effort to compete with dedicated activity trackers.\n\n\nIn January 2016, it was announced that one billion Apple devices were in active use worldwide.[155]\n\n\nOn June 6, 2016, *Fortune* released Fortune 500, its list of companies ranked on revenue generation. In the trailing fiscal year of 2015, Apple was listed as the top tech company.[156] It ranked third, overall, with $233 billion in revenue.[156] This represents a movement upward of two spots from the previous year's list.[156]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Apple announced the HomePod, its smart speaker aimed to compete against Sonos, Google Home, and Amazon Echo.[157] Towards the end of the year, *TechCrunch* reported that Apple was acquiring Shazam, a company that introduced its products at WWDC and specializing in music, TV, film and advertising recognition.[158] The acquisition was confirmed a few days later, reportedly costing Apple $400 million, with media reports that the purchase looked like a move to acquire data and tools bolstering the Apple Music streaming service.[159] The purchase was approved by the European Union in September 2018.[160]\n\n\nAlso in June 2017, Apple appointed Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg to head the newly formed worldwide video unit. In November 2017, Apple announced it was branching out into original scripted programming: a drama series starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, and a reboot of the anthology series Amazing Stories with Steven Spielberg.[161] In June 2018, Apple signed the Writers Guild of America's minimum basic agreement and Oprah Winfrey to a multi-year content partnership.[162] Additional partnerships for original series include Sesame Workshop and DHX Media and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide, as well as a partnership with A24 to create original films.[163]\n\n\nDuring the Apple Special Event in September 2017, the AirPower wireless charger was announced alongside the iPhone X, 8 and Watch Series 3. The AirPower was intended to wirelessly charge multiple devices, simultaneously. Though initially set to release in early 2018, the AirPower would be canceled in March 2019, marking the first cancellation of a device under Cook's leadership.[164]\n\n\nOn August 19, 2020, Apple's share price briefly topped $467.77, making it the first US company with a market capitalization of $2 trillion.[165]\n\n\n\n![](image)MacBook Air M1 (2020)\nDuring its annual WWDC keynote speech on June 22, 2020, Apple announced it would move away from Intel processors, and the Mac would transition to processors developed in-house.[166] The announcement was expected by industry analysts, and it has been noted that Macs featuring Apple's processors would allow for big increases in performance over current Intel-based models.[167] On November 10, 2020, the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and the Mac Mini became the first Mac devices powered by an Apple-designed processor, the Apple M1.[168]\n\n\nIn April 2022, it was reported that Samsung Electro-Mechanics would be collaborating with Apple on its M2 chip instead of LG Innotek.[169] Developer logs showed that at least nine Mac models with four different M2 chips were being tested.[170]\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that an effort to develop its own chips left Apple better prepared to deal with the semiconductor shortage that emerged during the pandemic era and led to increased profitability, with sales of Mac computers that included M1 chips rising sharply in 2020 and 2021. It also inspired other companies like Tesla, Amazon, and Meta Platforms to pursue a similar path.[171]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Apple opened an online store that allowed anyone in the US to view repair manuals and order replacement parts for specific recent iPhones, although the difference in cost between this method and official repair is anticipated to be minimal.[172]\n\n\nIn May 2022, a trademark was filed for RealityOS, an operating system reportedly intended for virtual and augmented reality headsets, first mentioned in 2017. According to Bloomberg, the headset may come out in 2023.[173] Further insider reports state that the device uses iris scanning for payment confirmation and signing into accounts.[174]\n\n\nOn June 18, 2022, the Apple Store in Towson, Maryland became the first to unionize in the U.S., with the employees voting to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.[175]\n\n\nOn July 7, 2022, Apple added Lockdown Mode to macOS 13 and iOS 16, as a response to the earlier Pegasus revelations; the mode increases security protections for high-risk users against targeted zero-day malware.[176]\n\n\nApple launched a buy now, pay later service called 'Apple Pay Later' for its Apple Wallet users in March 2023. The program allows its users to apply for loans between $50 and $1,000 to make online or in-app purchases and then repaying them through four installments spread over six weeks without any interest or fees.[177][178]\n\n\n\n## Products[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Apple Inc. products.\n\n### Mac[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac (computer)\n![A MacBook Air, in midnight color, on a wooden desk.](image)\nMacBook Air with M2 chip\n![An thin iMac in blue color on a desk.](image)\niMac with M1 chip\n\nThe Mac is Apple's family of personal computers. Macs are known for their ease of use[179] and distinctive aluminium, minimalist designs. Macs have been popular among students, creative professionals, and software engineers. The current lineup consists of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops, and the iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio and Mac Pro desktop computers.\n\n\nOften described as a walled garden, Macs use Apple silicon chips, run the macOS operating system, and include Apple software like the Safari web browser, iMovie for home movie editing, GarageBand for music creation, and the iWork productivity suite. Apple also sells pro apps: Final Cut Pro for video production, Logic Pro for musicians and producers, and Xcode for software developers.\n\n\nApple also sells a variety of accessories for Macs, including the Pro Display XDR, Apple Studio Display, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard.\n\n\n\n### iPhone[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iPhone\n\n![An iPhone 14 Pro with Chinese user interface, held by a customer, screen facing the camera](image)iPhone 14 Pro\nThe iPhone is Apple's line of smartphones, which run the iOS operating system. The first iPhone was unveiled by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, new models have been released annually. When it was introduced, its multi-touch screen was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry. The device has been credited with creating the app economy.\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the iPhone has 15% market share, yet represents 50% of global smartphone revenues, with Android phones accounting for the rest.[180][181] The iPhone has generated large profits for the company, and is credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.[182]\n\n\n\n### iPad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iPad\n\nThe iPad is Apple's line of tablets which run iPadOS. The first-generation iPad was announced on January 27, 2010. The iPad is mainly marketed for consuming multimedia, creating art, working on documents, videoconferencing, and playing games. The iPad lineup consists of several base iPad models, and the smaller iPad Mini, upgraded iPad Air, and high-end iPad Pro. Apple has consistently improved the iPad's performance, with the iPad Pro adopting the same M1 and M2 chips as the Mac; but the iPad still receives criticism for its limited OS.[183][184]\n\n\nAs of September 2020,[update] Apple has sold more than 500 million iPads, though sales peaked in 2013.[185] The iPad still remains the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2020[update],[186] and accounted for nine percent of the company's revenue as of the end of 2021[update].[1]\n\n\nApple sells several iPad accessories, including the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, Smart Keyboard Folio, Magic Keyboard, and several adapters.\n\n\n\n### Other products[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nAirPods Max\n![](image)\nApple Watch Ultra\n\nApple makes several other products that it categorizes as \"Wearables, Home and Accessories\".[187] These products include the AirPods line of wireless headphones, Apple TV digital media players, Apple Watch smartwatches, Beats headphones and HomePod Mini smart speakers.\n\n\nAs of the end of 2021[update], this broad line of products comprises about 11% of the company's revenues.[1]\n\n\nAt WWDC 2023, Apple introduced its new VR headset, Vision Pro, along with visionOS.[188] Apple announced that it will be partnering with Unity to bring existing 3D apps to Vision Pro using Unity's PolySpatial technology.[189][190][191][192]\n\n\n\n### Services[edit]\n\n\nApple offers a broad line of services, including advertising in the App Store and Apple News app, the AppleCare+ extended warranty plan, the iCloud+ cloud-based data storage service, payment services through the Apple Card credit card and the Apple Pay processing platform, digital content services including Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and the iTunes Store.\n\n\nAs of the end of 2021[update], services comprise about 19% of the company's revenue.[1] Many of the services have been launched as of 2019[update] when Apple announced it would be making a concerted effort to expand its service revenues.[193]\n\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Marketing of Apple Inc.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Marketing of Apple Inc..** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Branding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first official logo of Apple Inc. was used from 1977 to 1998.[194]\nAccording to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet. Jobs thought the name \"Apple\" was \"fun, spirited and not intimidating\".[195] Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were fans of the Beatles,[196] but Apple Inc. had name and logo trademark issues with Apple Corps Ltd., a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1968. This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with the settling of their lawsuit in 2007.[197]\n\n\nApple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's \"rainbow Apple\", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it.[198] On August 27, 1999,[199] Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation.[200]\n\n\nApple evangelists were actively engaged by the company at one time, but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established. Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism \"something that was stumbled upon,\"[201] while Ive claimed in 2014 that \"people have an incredibly personal relationship\" with Apple's products.[84]\n\n\n*Fortune* magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008, and in the world from 2008 to 2012.[202] On September 30, 2013, Apple surpassed Coca-Cola to become the world's most valuable brand in the Omnicom Group's \"Best Global Brands\" report.[203] Boston Consulting Group has ranked Apple as the world's most innovative brand every year as of 2005[update].[204]\n\n\nAs of January 2021,[update] 1.65 billion Apple products were in active use.[205][206] In February 2023 that number exceeded 2 billion devices.[207][208]\n\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Inc. advertising\n\nApple's first slogan, \"Byte into an Apple\", was coined in the late 1970s.[209] From 1997 to 2002, the slogan \"Think different\" was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple.[210] Apple also has slogans for specific product lines—for example, \"iThink, therefore iMac\" was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,[211] and \"Say hello to iPhone\" has been used in iPhone advertisements.[212] \"Hello\" was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, Newton, iMac (\"hello (again)\"), and iPod.[213]\n\n\nFrom the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, with the 1984 Super Bowl advertisement to the more modern Get a Mac adverts, Apple has been recognized for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products. However, claims made by later campaigns were criticized,[214] particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads.[215] Apple's product advertisements gained significant attention as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.[216] Musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on Apple advertisements include Canadian singer Feist with the song \"1234\" and Yael Naïm with the song \"New Soul\".[216]\n\n\n\n### Stores[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Store\n\n![](image)Apple Fifth Avenue is the flagship store in New York City.\n![](image)A Genius Bar is at Apple's Regent Street store in London.\nThe first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs,[91] after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts.[93] Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired Ron Johnson in 2000.[93] Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997,[217] and opened the first two physical stores in 2001.[91] The media initially speculated that Apple would fail,[94] but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.[94]\n\n\nOver the years, Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage, with 499 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of December 2017[update].[95] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.[218] Apple Stores underwent a period of significant redesign, beginning in May 2016. This redesign included physical changes to the Apple Stores, such as open spaces and re-branded rooms, as well as changes in function to facilitate interaction between consumers and professionals.[219]\n\n\nMany Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone \"flagship\" stores in high-profile locations.[93] It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores' designs and construction, specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes.[220] The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have lost traffic, control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores.[221] Due to the popularity of the brand, Apple receives a large number of job applications, many of which come from young workers.[218] Although Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts,[218] there are limited or no paths of career advancement.[218]\n\n\n\n### Market power[edit]\n\n\nOn March 16, 2020, France fined Apple €1.1 billion for colluding with two wholesalers to stifle competition and keep prices high by handicapping independent resellers. The arrangement created aligned prices for Apple products such as iPads and personal computers for about half the French retail market. According to the French regulators, the abuses occurred between 2005 and 2017 but were first discovered after a complaint by an independent reseller, eBizcuss, in 2012.[222]\n\n\nOn August 13, 2020, Epic Games, the maker of the popular game *Fortnite*, sued Apple and Google after its hugely popular video game was removed from Apple and Google's App Store. The suits came after both Apple and Google blocked the game after it introduced a direct payment system, effectively shutting out the tech titans from collecting fees.[223] In September 2020, Epic Games founded the Coalition for App Fairness together with thirteen other companies, which aims for better conditions for the inclusion of apps in the app stores.[224] Later, in December 2020, Facebook agreed to assist Epic in their legal game against Apple, planning to support the company by providing materials and documents to Epic. Facebook had, however, stated that the company would not participate directly with the lawsuit, although did commit to helping with the discovery of evidence relating to the trial of 2021. In the months prior to their agreement, Facebook had been dealing with feuds against Apple relating to the prices of paid apps as well as privacy rule changes.[225] Head of ad products for Facebook Dan Levy commented, saying that \"this is not really about privacy for them, this is about an attack on personalized ads and the consequences it's going to have on small-business owners,\" commenting on the full-page ads placed by Facebook in various newspapers in December 2020.[226]\n\n\n\n### Customer privacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)PRISM: a clandestine surveillance program under which the NSA collects user data from companies like Facebook and Apple[227]\nApple has a pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and settings part of its conferences, promotional campaigns, and public image.[228] With its iOS 8 mobile operating system in 2014, the company started encrypting all contents of iOS devices through users' passcodes, making it impossible at the time for the company to provide customer data to law enforcement requests seeking such information.[229] With the popularity rise of cloud storage solutions, Apple began a technique in 2016 to do deep learning scans for facial data in photos on the user's local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apple's iCloud storage system.[230] It also introduced \"differential privacy\", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual users anonymous, in a system that *Wired* described as \"trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning as little as possible about any individual in it\".[231] Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate, and can actively opt-in or opt-out.[232]\n\n\nWith Apple's release of an update to iOS 14, Apple required all developers of iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch applications to directly ask iPhone users permission to track them. The feature, titled \"App Tracking Transparency\", received heavy criticism from Facebook, whose primary business model revolves around the tracking of users' data and sharing such data with advertisers so users can see more relevant ads, a technique commonly known as targeted advertising. Despite Facebook's measures, including purchasing full-page newspaper advertisements protesting App Tracking Transparency, Apple released the update in mid-spring 2021. A study by Verizon subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only 4% of iOS users in the United States and 12% worldwide have opted into tracking.[233]\n\n\nHowever, Apple aids law enforcement in criminal investigations by providing iCloud backups of users' devices,[234] and the company's commitment to privacy has been questioned by its efforts to promote biometric authentication technology in its newer iPhone models, which do not have the same level of constitutional privacy as a passcode in the United States.[235]\n\n\nPrior to the release of iOS 15, Apple announced new efforts at combating child sexual abuse material on iOS and Mac platforms. Parents of minor iMessage users can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs. Additionally, on-device hashing would take place on media destined for upload to iCloud, and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement; if enough matches were found, Apple would be alerted and authorities informed. The new features received praise from law enforcement and victims rights advocates, however privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, condemned the new features as invasive and highly prone to abuse by authoritarian governments.[236]\n\n\nIreland's Data Protection Commission launched a privacy investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EU's GDPR law following an investigation into how the company processes personal data with targeted ads on its platform.[237]\n\n\nIn December 2019, a report found that the iPhone 11 Pro continues tracking location and collecting user data even after users have disabled location services. In response, an Apple engineer said the Location Services icon \"appears for system services that do not have a switch in settings.\"[238]\n\n\nAccording to published reports by Bloomberg News on March 30, 2022, Apple turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, an Apple representative referred the reporter to a section of the company policy for law enforcement guidelines, which stated, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[239]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple, Braeburn Capital, and FileMaker\n\n### Business trends[edit]\n\n\nThe key trends for Apple are (as of the financial year ending September 24):[240][241]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | 2011\n | 2012\n | 2013\n | 2014\n | 2015\n | 2016\n | 2017\n | 2018\n | 2019\n | 2020\n | 2021\n | 2022\n | 2023\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue figures\n |\n| Total revenue (US$ b)[242] | 108\n | 156\n | 170\n | 182\n | 233\n | 215\n | 229\n | 265\n | 260\n | 274\n | 365\n | 394\n | 383\n |\n| - iPhone revenue (US$ b)\n | 45.9\n | 78.6\n | 91.2\n | 101\n | 155\n | 136\n | 139\n | 164\n | 142\n | 137\n | 191\n | 205\n | 200\n |\n| - Mac revenue (US$ b)\n | 21.7\n | 23.2\n | 21.4\n | 24.0\n | 25.4\n | 22.8\n | 25.5\n | 25.1\n | 25.7\n | 28.6\n | 35.1\n | 40.1\n | 29.3\n |\n| - iPad revenue (US$ b)\n | 19.1\n | 30.9\n | 31.9\n | 30.2\n | 23.2\n | 20.6\n | 18.8\n | 18.3\n | 21.2\n | 23.7\n | 31.8\n | 29.2\n | 28.3\n |\n| - Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue (US$ b)\n | 11.9\n | 10.7\n | 10.1\n | 8.3\n | 10.0\n | 11.1\n | 12.8\n | 17.3\n | 24.4\n | 30.6\n | 38.3\n | 41.2\n | 39.8\n |\n| - Services revenue (US$ b)\n | 9.3\n | 12.8\n | 16.0\n | 18.0\n | 19.9\n | 24.3\n | 32.7\n | 39.7\n | 46.2\n | 53.7\n | 68.4\n | 78.1\n | 85.2\n |\n| Non-revenue figures\n |\n| Net profit (US$ b)[243] | 25.9\n | 41.7\n | 37.0\n | 39.5\n | 53.3\n | 45.6\n | 48.3\n | 59.3\n | 55.2\n | 57.4\n | 94.6\n | 99.8\n | 96.9\n |\n| Number of employees (k, FTE)\n | 60.4\n | 72.8\n | 80.3\n | 92.6\n | 110\n | 116\n | 123\n | 132\n | 137\n | 147\n | 154\n | 164\n | 161\n |\n| References | [244] | [245] | [246] | [247] | [248] | [249] | [250] | [251] | [252] | [253] | [254] | [255] | [256] |\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n#### Senior management[edit]\n\n\nAs of March 16, 2021[update], the management of Apple Inc. includes:[257]\n\n\n\n* Tim Cook (chief executive officer)\n* Jeff Williams (chief operating officer)\n* Luca Maestri (senior vice president and chief financial officer)\n* Katherine L.

Steve Jobs (1997–2011)\n\n\n### Corporate culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Co-founder Steve Wozniak and engineer Andy Hertzfeld attended the Apple User Group Connection club in 1985.\n![](image)Universities with the most alumni at Apple\nApple is one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[258] According to a 2011 report in *Fortune*, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[259] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching *Star Trek* and attending *Star Trek* conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[260]\n\n\nAs the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than others.[261]\n\n\nThe Apple Fellows program awards employees for extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing. Recipients include Bill Atkinson,[262] Steve Capps,[263] Rod Holt,[262] Alan Kay,[264][265] Guy Kawasaki,[264][266] Al Alcorn,[267] Don Norman,[264] Rich Page,[262] Steve Wozniak,[262] and Phil Schiller.[268]\n\n\nAt Apple, employees are intended to be specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise.[*needs update*] Jobs saw this as a means of having \"best-in-class\" employees in every role. For instance, Ron Johnson—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores. This was done by Tim Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management.[269] Apple is known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a \"directly responsible individual\" or \"DRI\" in Apple jargon.[259][270] As an example, when iOS senior vice president Scott Forstall refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned Maps app, he was forced to resign.[271] Unlike other major U.S. companies, Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.[272]\n\n\nIn 2015, Apple had 110,000 full-time employees. This increased to 116,000 full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline. Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail, though its 2014 SEC filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base.[273] In September 2017, Apple announced that it had over 123,000 full-time employees.[274]\n\n\nApple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy, and has an anti-leak Global Security team that recruits from the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Secret Service.[275]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Glassdoor said Apple was the 48th best place to work, having originally entered at rank 19 in 2009, peaking at rank 10 in 2012, and falling down the ranks in subsequent years.[276]\n\n\nIn 2023, *Bloomberg*'s Mark Gurman revealed the existence of Apple's Exploratory Design Group (XDG), which was working to add glucose monitoring to the Apple Watch. Gurman compared XDG to Alphabet's X \"moonshot factory\".[277]\n\n\n\n### Offices[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Apple Park and Apple Campus\n\n![](image)Apple Park is the main headquarters in Cupertino.\nApple Inc.'s world corporate headquarters are located in Cupertino, in the middle of California's Silicon Valley, at Apple Park, a massive circular groundscraper building with a circumference of one mile (1.6 km). The building opened in April 2017 and houses more than 12,000 employees. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs wanted Apple Park to look less like a business park and more like a nature refuge, and personally appeared before the Cupertino City Council in June 2011 to make the proposal, in his final public appearance before his death.\n\n\n\n![](image)The original Apple Campus has the street address 1 Infinite Loop, Sunnyvale, California.\nApple also operates from the Apple Campus (also known by its address, 1 Infinite Loop), a grouping of six buildings in Cupertino that total 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2) located about 1 mile (1.6 km) to the west of Apple Park.[278] The Apple Campus was the company's headquarters from its opening in 1993, until the opening of Apple Park in 2017. The buildings, located at 1–6 Infinite Loop, are arranged in a circular pattern around a central green space, in a design that has been compared to that of a university.\n\n\nIn addition to Apple Park and the Apple Campus, Apple occupies an additional thirty office buildings scattered throughout the city of Cupertino, including three buildings as prior headquarters: Stephens Creek Three from 1977 to 1978, Bandley One from 1978 to 1982, and Mariani One from 1982 to 1993.[279] In total, Apple occupies almost 40% of the available office space in the city.[280]\n\n\nApple's headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are located in Cork in the south of Ireland, called the Hollyhill campus.[281] The facility, which opened in 1980, houses 5,500 people and was Apple's first location outside of the United States.[282] Apple's international sales and distribution arms operate out of the campus in Cork.[283]\n\n\nApple has two campuses near Austin, Texas: a 216,000-square-foot (20,100 m2) campus opened in 2014 houses 500 engineers who work on Apple silicon[284] and a 1.1-million-square-foot (100,000 m2) campus opened in 2021 where 6,000 people work in technical support, supply chain management, online store curation, and Apple Maps data management.\n\n\nThe company also has several other locations in Boulder, Colorado, Culver City, California, Herzliya (Israel), London, New York, Pittsburgh, San Diego, and Seattle that each employ hundreds of people.[285]\n\n\n\n### Litigation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Litigation involving Apple Inc.\n\nApple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.[286] In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include *Apple v. Samsung*, *Apple v. Microsoft*, *Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.*, and *Apple Corps v. Apple Computer*. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights. Most have been dismissed in the courts as shell companies known as patent trolls, with no evidence of actual use of patents in question.[287] On December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S. and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter's products infringe on Nokia's patents.[288] Most recently, in November 2017, the United States International Trade Commission announced an investigation into allegations of patent infringement in regards to Apple's remote desktop technology; Aqua Connect, a company that builds remote desktop software, has claimed that Apple infringed on two of its patents.[289] In January 2022, Ericsson sued Apple over payment of royalty of 5G technology.[290]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple\n\nApple is the world's largest technology company by revenue, the world's largest technology company by total assets,[291] and the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung.[292]\n\n\nIn its fiscal year ending in September 2011, Apple Inc. reported a total of $108 billion in annual revenues—a significant increase from its 2010 revenues of $65 billion—and nearly $82 billion in cash reserves.[293] On March 19, 2012, Apple announced plans for a $2.65-per-share dividend beginning in fourth quarter of 2012, per approval by their board of directors.[294]\n\n\nThe company's worldwide annual revenue in 2013 totaled $170 billion.[295] In May 2013, Apple entered the top ten of the *Fortune* 500 list of companies for the first time, rising 11 places above its 2012 ranking to take the sixth position.[296] As of 2016[update], Apple has around US$234 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which 90% is located outside the United States for tax purposes.[297]\n\n\nApple amassed 65% of all profits made by the eight largest worldwide smartphone manufacturers in quarter one of 2014, according to a report by Canaccord Genuity. In the first quarter of 2015, the company garnered 92% of all earnings.[298]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2017, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple had cash reserves of $250 billion,[299] officially confirmed by Apple as specifically $256.8 billion a few days later.[300]\n\n\nAs of August 3, 2018[update], Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization. On August 2, 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach a $1 trillion market value.[301][302] Apple was ranked No. 4 on the 2018 *Fortune* 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[303]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Apple reported an 11% decline in Q3 profits compared to 2021. Its revenue in the same period rose 2% year-on-year to $83 billion, though this figure was also lower than in 2021, where the increase was at 36%. The general downturn is reportedly caused by the slowing global economy and supply chain disruptions in China.[304]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Apple reported a decline in its sales for the first quarter of 2023. Compared to that of 2022, revenue for 2023 fell by 3%. This is Apple's second consecutive quarter of sales decline. This fall is attributed to the slowing economy and consumers putting off purchases of iPads and computers due to increased pricing. However, iPhone sales held up with a year-on-year increase of 1.5%. According to Apple, demands for such devices were strong, particularly in Latin America and South Asia.[305]\n\n\n\n### Taxes[edit]\n\n\nApple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to *The New York Times*, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the \"Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich\", which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.[306][307]\n\n\nBritish Conservative Party Member of Parliament Charlie Elphicke published research on October 30, 2012,[308] which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard corporate tax rates. He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and The Coca-Cola Company, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.[309]\n\n\nAccording to a US Senate report on the company's offshore tax structure concluded in May 2013, Apple has held billions of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries to pay little or no taxes to any government by using an unusual global tax structure.[310] The main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple's retail stores throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years. \"Apple has exploited a difference between Irish and U.S. tax residency rules\", the report said.[311]\n\n\nOn May 21, 2013, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his company's tax tactics at a Senate hearing.[312]\n\n\nApple says that it is the single largest taxpayer in the U.S., with an effective tax rate of approximately of 26% as of Q2 FY2016.[313] In an interview with the German newspaper *FAZ* in October 2017, Tim Cook stated that Apple was the biggest taxpayer worldwide.[314]\n\n\nIn 2016, after a two-year investigation, the European Commission claimed that Apple's use of a hybrid Double Irish tax arrangement constituted \"illegal state aid\" from Ireland, and ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in unpaid taxes, the largest corporate tax fine in history. This was later annulled, after the European General Court ruled that the Commission had provided insufficient evidence.[315][316] In 2018, Apple repatriated $285 billion to America, resulting in a $38 billion tax payment spread over the following 8 years.[317]\n\n\n\n### Charity[edit]\n\n\nApple is a partner of (PRODUCT)RED, a fundraising campaign for AIDS charity. In November 2014, Apple arranged for all App Store revenue in a two-week period to go to the fundraiser,[318] generating more than US$20 million,[319] and in March 2017, it released an iPhone 7 with a red color finish.[320]\n\n\nApple contributes financially to fundraisers in times of natural disasters. In November 2012, it donated $2.5 million to the American Red Cross to aid relief efforts after Hurricane Sandy,[321] and in 2017 it donated $5 million to relief efforts for both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey,[322] as well as for the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake.[323] The company has also used its iTunes platform to encourage donations in the wake of environmental disasters and humanitarian crises, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake,[324] the 2011 Japan earthquake,[325] Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in November 2013,[326] and the 2015 European migrant crisis.[327] Apple emphasizes that it does not incur any processing or other fees for iTunes donations, sending 100% of the payments directly to relief efforts, though it also acknowledges that the Red Cross does not receive any personal information on the users donating and that the payments may not be tax deductible.[328]\n\n\nOn April 14, 2016, Apple and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) announced that they have engaged in a partnership to, \"help protect life on our planet.\" Apple released a special page in the iTunes App Store, Apps for Earth. In the arrangement, Apple has committed that through April 24, WWF will receive 100% of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases. Apple and WWF's Apps for Earth campaign raised more than $8 million in total proceeds to support WWF's conservation work. WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco.[329]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Apple's CEO Cook announced that the company will be donating \"millions\" of masks to health workers in the United States and Europe.[330]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2021, Apple announced a $100 million \"Racial Equity and Justice Initiative\" to help combat institutional racism worldwide.[331][332]\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environmental impact of Apple\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Environmental impact of Apple.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Apple Energy[edit]\n\n\nApple Energy, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple Inc. that sells solar energy. As of June 6, 2016[update], Apple's solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity.[333] In addition to the company's solar energy production, Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a landfill gas energy plant in North Carolina. Apple will use the methane emissions to generate electricity.[334] Apple's North Carolina data center is already powered entirely with energy from renewable sources.[335]\n\n\n\n### Energy and resources[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category \"Striding\".[336] This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a \"stuck icon\", adding that Apple at the time was \"a choice to avoid for the climate-conscious consumer\".[337]\n\n\nFollowing a Greenpeace protest, Apple released a statement on April 17, 2012, committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100% renewable clean energy.[338][339] By 2013, Apple was using 100% renewable energy to power their data centers. Overall, 75% of the company's power came from clean renewable sources.[340]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying, \"Apple's commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry, illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100% renewable Internet is within its reach, and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet.\"[341]\n\n\nAs of 2016[update], Apple states that 100% of its U.S. operations run on renewable energy, 100% of Apple's data centers run on renewable energy and 93% of Apple's global operations run on renewable energy.[342] However, the facilities are connected to the local grid which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources, so Apple carbon offsets its electricity use.[343] The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment. Each product receives a Gold, Silver, or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability. Every Apple tablet, notebook, desktop computer, and display that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating, the highest possible. Although Apple's data centers recycle water 35 times,[344] the increased activity in retail, corporate and data centers also increase the amount of water use to 573 million US gal (2.2 million m3) in 2015.[345]\n\n\nDuring an event on March 21, 2016, Apple provided a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable in all of its worldwide operations. Lisa P. Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016[update], 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from post-consumer recycled paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products.[346] Apple working in partnership with Conservation Fund, have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in Maine and North Carolina. Another partnership announced is with the World Wildlife Fund to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres (4,000 km2) of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 MW solar power plant in the Sichuan province of China that was tailor-made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In Singapore, Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones. Reuses and recycles parts from traded in products.[347]\n\n\nApple announced on August 16, 2016, that Lens Technology, one of its major suppliers in China, has committed to power all its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by 2018. The commitment is a large step in Apple's efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China.[348] Apple also announced that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL's Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The standard, which started in January 2015, certifies that all manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or converted into energy (when necessary). Since the program began, nearly 140,000 metric tons of waste have been diverted from landfills.[349]\n\n\nOn July 21, 2020, Apple announced its plan to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. In the next 10 years, Apple will try to lower emissions with a series of innovative actions, including: low carbon product design, expanding energy efficiency, renewable energy, process and material innovations, and carbon removal.[350]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Apple said that it had started a $200 million fund in order to combat climate change by removing 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year.[351]\n\n\nIn February 2022, the NewClimate Institute, a German environmental policy think tank, published a survey evaluating the transparency and progress of the climate strategies and carbon neutrality pledges announced by 25 major companies in the United States that found that Apple's carbon neutrality pledge and climate strategy was unsubstantiated and misleading.[352][353]\n\n\n\n### Toxins[edit]\n\n\nFollowing further campaigns by Greenpeace,[354] in 2008, Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to eliminate all polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in its complete product line.[355] In June 2007, Apple began replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCD displays in its computers with mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass, starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro.[356][357][358][359] Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO2e, emissions, materials, and electrical usage concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which they have enough data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage. Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale.[360] In June 2009, Apple's iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs.[356][361] All Apple products now have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables. All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product's respective regulatory category.[356][362]\n\n\nIn November 2011, Apple was featured in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how \"green\" their products are. The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10.[363] Greenpeace praised Apple's sustainability, noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. Apple continues to score well on product ratings, with all of their products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticized Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data, and for not setting any targets to reduce emissions.[364] In January 2012, Apple requested that its cable maker, Volex, begin producing halogen-free USB and power cables.[365]\n\n\n\n### Green bonds[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2016, Apple issued a $1.5 billion green bond (climate bond), the first ever of its kind by a U.S. tech company. The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects.[366]\n\n\n\n## Supply chain[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple supply chain\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Apple supply chain.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\nApple products were made in America in Apple-owned factories until the late 1990s; however, as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by *The New York Times*, Apple insiders \"believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that \"Made in the USA\" is no longer a viable option for most Apple products\".[367]\n\n\nThe company's manufacturing, procurement, and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: \"Nobody wants to buy sour milk.\"[368][369]\n\n\nIn May 2017, the company announced a $1 billion funding project for \"advanced manufacturing\" in the United States,[370] and subsequently invested $200 million in Corning Inc., a manufacturer of toughened Gorilla Glass technology used in its iPhone devices.[371] The following December, Apple's chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, told *CNBC* that the \"$1 billion\" amount was \"absolutely not\" the final limit on its spending, elaborating that \"We're not thinking in terms of a fund limit... We're thinking about, where are the opportunities across the U.S. to help nurture companies that are making the advanced technology— and the advanced manufacturing that goes with that— that quite frankly is essential to our innovation.\"[372]\n\n\nAs of 2021[update], Apple uses components from 43 countries.[373] The majority of assembling is done by Taiwanese original design manufacturer firms Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics with factories mostly located inside China,[374] but also Brazil,[375] and India.[376]\n\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., (TSMC) is a pure-play semiconductor manufacturing company. They make the majority of Apple's smartphone SoCs, with Samsung Semiconductor, playing a minority role.[377] Apple, alone accounted for over 25% of TSMC's total income in 2021.[378] Apple's Bionic lineup of smartphone SoCs, are currently made exclusively by TSMC[379] from the A7 bionic onwards, previously manufacturing was shared with Samsung. The M series of Apple SoC for consumer computers and tablets is made by TSMC as well.[380]\n\n\nDuring the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.[381] This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the PCI bus in the 7500/8500/9500 Power Macs. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as USB, AGP, HyperTransport, Wi-Fi, NVMe, PCIe and others in its products. FireWire is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as IEEE 1394 and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.[382]\n\n\nApple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO Tim Cook said that he \"[loves] India\", but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region.[383] India's requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as \"really adds cost to getting product to market\".[384] In May 2016, Apple opened an iOS app development center in Bangalore and a maps development office for 4,000 staff in Hyderabad.[385] In March, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India \"over the next two months\",[386] and in May, the *Journal* wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of iPhone SE in the country,[387] while Apple told *CNBC* that the manufacturing was for a \"small number\" of units.[388] In April 2019, Apple initiated manufacturing of iPhone 7 at its Bengaluru facility, keeping in mind demand from local customers even as they seek more incentives from the government of India.[389] At the beginning of 2020, Tim Cook announced that Apple schedules the opening of its first physical outlet in India for 2021, while an online store is to be launched by the end of the year.[390]\n\n\nDuring the 2022 COVID-19 protests in China, Chinese state-owned company Wingtech was reported by *The Wall Street Journal* to gain an additional foothold in Apple's supply chain following protests at a Foxconn factory in the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone.[391]\n\n\n\n### Worker organizations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple and unions\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Apple and unions.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\nIn 2006, one complex of factories in Shenzhen, China that assembled the iPod and other items had over 200,000 workers living and working within it. Employees regularly worked more than 60 hours per week and made around $100 per month. A little over half of the workers' earnings was required to pay for rent and food from the company.[392][393]\n\n\nApple immediately launched an investigation after the 2006 media report, and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions.[394] In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding worker's rights, slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply. Yearly progress reports have been published as of 2008[update].[395] In 2011, Apple admitted that its suppliers' child labor practices in China had worsened.[396]\n\n\nThe Foxconn suicides occurred between January and November 2010, when 18 Foxconn (Chinese: 富士康) employees attempted suicide,[397] resulting in 14 deaths—the company was the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, for clients including Apple, at the time.[397][398][399] The suicides drew media attention, and employment practices at Foxconn were investigated by Apple.[400] Apple issued a public statement about the suicides, and company spokesperson Steven Dowling said:\n\n\n\n\n> [Apple is] saddened and upset by the recent suicides at Foxconn ... A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made.[401]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe statement was released after the results from the company's probe into its suppliers' labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple's own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories.[401] Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.[402]\n\n\nAlso in 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.[403] After a high suicide rate in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit a lower rate than that of China as a whole,[404] workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves.[405] Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to hexane, a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.[406]\n\n\nA 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing as of 2010[update], Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: \"We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions\".[402]\n\n\nIn December 2014, the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in \"primitive, dark and filthy dorms\" where they sleep \"on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room.\" Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.[407]\n\n\nIn 2019, there were reports stating that some of Foxconn's managers had used rejected parts to build iPhones and that Apple was investigating the issue.[408]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Apple Inc. media events\n* Pixar\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Apple 10-K Report FY2021\" (PDF).

Microsoft's best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, and the Edge web browser. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No. 14 in the 2022 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue;[2] it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of 2022. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, and Meta.\n\n\nMicrosoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made several corporate acquisitions, the largest being the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in October 2023,[3] followed by its acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[4] and its acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.[5]\n\n\nAs of 2015[update], Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android.[6] The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio).\n\n\nSteve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000 and later envisioned a \"devices and services\" strategy.[7] This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008,[8] entering the personal computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped the company's shares reach their highest value since December 1999.[9][10] Under Nadella's direction, the company has also heavily expanded it's gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the Microsoft Gaming division in 2022, dedicated to operating Xbox in addition to it's three subsidiaries (publishers). Microsoft Gaming is the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue as of 2023.[11]\n\n\nEarlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018, Microsoft reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.[12] In April 2019, Microsoft reached a trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon, respectively. As of 2023[update], Microsoft has the third-highest global brand valuation.\n\n\nMicrosoft has been criticized for its monopolistic practices and the company's software has been criticized for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Microsoft\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Microsoft.\n\n### 1972–1985: Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An Altair 8800 computer (left) with the popular Model 33 ASR Teletype as terminal, paper tape reader, and paper tape punch\n![](image)Paul Allen and Bill Gates on October 19, 1981, after signing a pivotal contract with IBM[13]: 228\n![](image)Bill Gates and Paul Allen's Original Business Cards located in the Microsoft Visitor Center.\nChildhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen sought to make a business using their skills in computer programming.[14] In 1972, they founded Traf-O-Data, which sold a rudimentary computer to track and analyze automobile traffic data. Gates enrolled at Harvard University while Allen pursued a degree in computer science at Washington State University, though he later dropped out to work at Honeywell.[15] The January 1975 issue of *Popular Electronics* featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems's (MITS) Altair 8800 microcomputer,[16] which inspired Allen to suggest that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device. Gates called MITS and claimed that he had a working interpreter, and MITS requested a demonstration. Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter, and it worked flawlessly when they demonstrated it to MITS in March 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC.[13]: 108, 112–114 Gates and Allen established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as CEO,[17] and Allen suggested the name \"Micro-Soft,\" short for micro-computer software.[18][19] In August 1977, the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office of ASCII Microsoft.[20] Microsoft moved its headquarters to Bellevue, Washington, in January 1979.[17]\n\n\nMicrosoft entered the operating system (OS) business in 1980 with its own version of Unix called Xenix,[21] but it was MS-DOS that solidified the company's dominance. IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M OS to be used in the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC).[22] For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products which it branded as MS-DOS, although IBM rebranded it to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981. IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, so other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor.[23][24]: 210 The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as with a publishing division named Microsoft Press.[13]: 232\nPaul Allen resigned from Microsoft in 1983 after developing Hodgkin's lymphoma.[25] Allen claimed in *Idea Man: A Memoir by the Co-founder of Microsoft* that Gates wanted to dilute his share in the company when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease because he did not think that he was working hard enough.[26] Allen later invested in low-tech sectors, sports teams, commercial real estate, neuroscience, private space flight, and more.[27]\n\n\n\n### 1985–1994: Windows and Office[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Windows 1.0 was released on November 20, 1985, as the first version of the Windows line.\nMicrosoft released Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical extension for MS-DOS,[13]: 242–243, 246 despite having begun jointly developing OS/2 with IBM the previous August.[28] Microsoft moved its headquarters from Bellevue to Redmond, Washington, on February 26, 1986, and went public on March 13,[29] with the resulting rise in stock making an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees.[30] Microsoft released its version of OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on April 2, 1987.[13] In 1990, the Federal Trade Commission examined Microsoft for possible collusion due to the partnership with IBM, marking the beginning of more than a decade of legal clashes with the government.[31] : 243–244 Meanwhile, the company was at work on Microsoft Windows NT, which was heavily based on their copy of the OS/2 code. It shipped on July 21, 1993, with a new modular kernel and the 32-bit Win32 application programming interface (API), making it easier to port from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based) Windows. Microsoft informed IBM of Windows NT, and the OS/2 partnership deteriorated.[32]\n\n\nIn 1990, Microsoft introduced the Microsoft Office suite which bundled separate applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.[13]: 301 On May 22, Microsoft launched Windows 3.0, featuring streamlined user interface graphics and improved protected mode capability for the Intel 386 processor,[33] and both Office and Windows became dominant in their respective areas.[34][35]\n\n\nOn July 27, 1994, the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division filed a competitive impact statement that said: \"Beginning in 1988 and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti-competitive 'per processor licenses. Under a per-processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM's use of a competing PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft's use of per processor licenses has increased.\"[36]\n\n\n\n### 1995–2007: Foray into the Web, Windows 95, Windows XP, and Xbox[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 1996, Microsoft released Windows CE, a version of the operating system meant for personal digital assistants and other tiny computers, shown here on the HP 300LX.\nFollowing Bill Gates's internal \"Internet Tidal Wave memo\" on May 26, 1995, Microsoft began to redefine its offerings and expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web.[37] With a few exceptions of new companies, like Netscape, Microsoft was the only major and established company that acted fast enough to be a part of the World Wide Web practically from the start. Other companies like Borland, WordPerfect, Novell, IBM and Lotus, being much slower to adapt to the new situation, would give Microsoft market dominance.[38] The company released Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, featuring pre-emptive multitasking, a completely new user interface with a novel start button, and 32-bit compatibility; similar to NT, it provided the Win32 API.[39][40]: 20 Windows 95 came bundled with the online service MSN, which was at first intended to be a competitor to the Internet,[*dubious – discuss*] and (for OEMs) Internet Explorer, a Web browser. Internet Explorer has not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes, because the boxes were printed before the team finished the Web browser, and instead were included in the Windows 95 Plus! pack.[41] Backed by a high-profile marketing campaign[42] and what *The New York Times* called \"the splashiest, most frenzied, most expensive introduction of a computer product in the industry's history,\"[43] Windows 95 quickly became a success.[44] Branching out into new markets in 1996, Microsoft and General Electric's NBC unit created a new 24/7 cable news channel, MSNBC.[45] Microsoft created Windows CE 1.0, a new OS designed for devices with low memory and other constraints, such as personal digital assistants.[46] In October 1997, the Justice Department filed a motion in the Federal District Court, stating that Microsoft violated an agreement signed in 1994 and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.[13]: 323–324\n\n\n\n![](image)Microsoft released the first installment in the Xbox series of consoles in 2001. The Xbox, graphically powerful compared to its rivals, featured a standard PC's 733 MHz Intel Pentium III processor.\nOn January 13, 2000, Bill Gates handed over the CEO position to Steve Ballmer, an old college friend of Gates and employee of the company since 1980, while creating a new position for himself as Chief Software Architect.[13]: 111, 228[17] Various companies including Microsoft formed the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance in October 1999 to (among other things) increase security and protect intellectual property through identifying changes in hardware and software. Critics decried the alliance as a way to enforce indiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software, and over how computers behave, and as a form of digital rights management: for example, the scenario where a computer is not only secured for its owner but also secured against its owner as well.[47][48] On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the case of *United States v. Microsoft Corp.*,[49] calling the company an \"abusive monopoly.\"[50] Microsoft later settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2004.[29] On October 25, 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP, unifying the mainstream and NT lines of OS under the NT codebase.[51] The company released the Xbox later that year, entering the video game console market dominated by Sony and Nintendo.[52] In March 2004 the European Union brought antitrust legal action against the company, citing it abused its dominance with the Windows OS, resulting in a judgment of €497 million ($613 million) and requiring Microsoft to produce new versions of Windows XP without Windows Media Player: Windows XP Home Edition N and Windows XP Professional N.[53][54] In November 2005, the company's second video game console, the Xbox 360, was released. There were two versions, a basic version for $299.99 and a deluxe version for $399.99.[55]\n\n\nIncreasingly present in the hardware business following Xbox, Microsoft 2006 released the Zune series of digital media players, a successor of its previous software platform Portable Media Center. These expanded on previous hardware commitments from Microsoft following its original Microsoft Mouse in 1983; as of 2007 the company sold the best-selling wired keyboard (Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000), mouse (IntelliMouse), and desktop webcam (LifeCam) in the United States. That year the company also launched the Surface \"digital table\", later renamed PixelSense.[56]\n\n\n\n### 2007–2011: Microsoft Azure, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Microsoft Stores[edit]\n\n\n![](image)CEO Steve Ballmer at the MIX event in 2008. In an interview about his management style in 2005, he mentioned that his first priority was to get the people he delegates to in order. Ballmer also emphasized the need to continue pursuing new technologies even if initial attempts fail, citing the original attempts with Windows as an example.[57]\n![](image)Headquarters of the European Commission, which has imposed several fines on Microsoft\nReleased in January 2007, the next version of Windows, Vista, focused on features, security and a redesigned user interface dubbed Aero.[58][59] Microsoft Office 2007, released at the same time, featured a \"Ribbon\" user interface which was a significant departure from its predecessors. Relatively strong sales of both products helped to produce a record profit in 2007.[60] The European Union imposed another fine of €899 million ($1.4 billion) for Microsoft's lack of compliance with the March 2004 judgment on February 27, 2008, saying that the company charged rivals unreasonable prices for key information about its workgroup and backoffice servers.[61] Microsoft stated that it was in compliance and that \"these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved\".[62] 2007 also saw the creation of a multi-core unit at Microsoft, following the steps of server companies such as Sun and IBM.[63]\n\n\nGates retired from his role as Chief Software Architect on June 27, 2008, a decision announced in June 2006, while retaining other positions related to the company in addition to being an advisor for the company on key projects.[64][65] Azure Services Platform, the company's entry into the cloud computing market for Windows, launched on October 27, 2008.[66] On February 12, 2009, Microsoft announced its intent to open a chain of Microsoft-branded retail stores, and on October 22, 2009, the first retail Microsoft Store opened in Scottsdale, Arizona; the same day Windows 7 was officially released to the public. Windows 7's focus was on refining Vista with ease-of-use features and performance enhancements, rather than an extensive reworking of Windows.[67][68][69]\n\n\nAs the smartphone industry boomed in the late 2000s, Microsoft had struggled to keep up with its rivals in providing a modern smartphone operating system, falling behind Apple and Google-sponsored Android in the United States.[70] As a result, in 2010 Microsoft revamped their aging flagship mobile operating system, Windows Mobile, replacing it with the new Windows Phone OS that was released in October that year.[71][72] It used a new user interface design language, codenamed \"Metro,\" which prominently used simple shapes, typography, and iconography, utilizing the concept of minimalism. Microsoft implemented a new strategy for the software industry, providing a consistent user experience across all smartphones using the Windows Phone OS. It launched an alliance with Nokia in 2011 and Microsoft worked closely with the company to co-develop Windows Phone,[73] but remained partners with long-time Windows Mobile OEM HTC.[74] Microsoft is a founding member of the Open Networking Foundation started on March 23, 2011. Fellow founders were Google, HP Networking, Yahoo!, Verizon Communications, Deutsche Telekom and 17 other companies. This nonprofit organization is focused on providing support for a cloud computing initiative called Software-Defined Networking.[75] The initiative is meant to speed innovation through simple software changes in telecommunications networks, wireless networks, data centers, and other networking areas.[76]\n\n\n\n### 2011–2014: Windows 8/8.1, Xbox One, Outlook.com, and Surface devices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Surface Pro 3, part of the Surface series of laplets by Microsoft\nFollowing the release of Windows Phone, Microsoft undertook a gradual rebranding of its product range throughout 2011 and 2012, with the corporation's logos, products, services, and websites adopting the principles and concepts of the Metro design language.[77] Microsoft unveiled Windows 8, an operating system designed to power both personal computers and tablet computers, in Taipei in June 2011.[78] A developer preview was released on September 13, which was subsequently replaced by a consumer preview on February 29, 2012, and released to the public in May.[79] The Surface was unveiled on June 18, becoming the first computer in the company's history to have its hardware made by Microsoft.[80][81] On June 25, Microsoft paid US$1.2 billion to buy the social network Yammer.[82] On July 31, they launched the Outlook.com webmail service to compete with Gmail.[83] On September 4, 2012, Microsoft released Windows Server 2012.[84]\n\n\nIn July 2012, Microsoft sold its 50% stake in MSNBC, which it had run as a joint venture with NBC since 1996.[85] On October 1, Microsoft announced its intention to launch a news operation, part of a new-look MSN, with Windows 8 later in the month.[86] On October 26, 2012, Microsoft launched Windows 8 and the Microsoft Surface.[81][87] Three days later, Windows Phone 8 was launched.[88] To cope with the potential for an increase in demand for products and services, Microsoft opened a number of \"holiday stores\" across the U.S. to complement the increasing number of \"bricks-and-mortar\" Microsoft Stores that opened in 2012.[89] On March 29, 2013, Microsoft launched a Patent Tracker.[90]\n\n\nIn August 2012, the New York City Police Department announced a partnership with Microsoft for the development of the Domain Awareness System which is used for Police surveillance in New York City.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Xbox One console, released in 2013\nThe Kinect, a motion-sensing input device made by Microsoft and designed as a video game controller, first introduced in November 2010, was upgraded for the 2013 release of the Xbox One video game console. Kinect's capabilities were revealed in May 2013: an ultra-wide 1080p camera, function in the dark due to an infrared sensor, higher-end processing power and new software, the ability to distinguish between fine movements (such as a thumb movement), and determining a user's heart rate by looking at their face.[92] Microsoft filed a patent application in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the Kinect camera system to monitor the behavior of television viewers as part of a plan to make the viewing experience more interactive. On July 19, 2013, Microsoft stocks suffered their biggest one-day percentage sell-off since the year 2000, after its fourth-quarter report raised concerns among investors on the poor showings of both Windows 8 and the Surface tablet. Microsoft suffered a loss of more than US$32 billion.[93]\n\n\nIn line with the maturing PC business, in July 2013, Microsoft announced that it would reorganize the business into four new business divisions, namely Operating systems, Apps, Cloud, and Devices. All previous divisions will be dissolved into new divisions without any workforce cuts.[94] On September 3, 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy Nokia's mobile unit for $7 billion,[95] following Amy Hood taking the role of CFO.[96]\n\n\n\n\n### 2014–2020: Windows 10, Microsoft Edge, and HoloLens[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satya Nadella succeeded Steve Ballmer as the CEO of Microsoft in February 2014.\nOn February 4, 2014, Steve Ballmer stepped down as CEO of Microsoft and was succeeded by Satya Nadella, who previously led Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise division.[97] On the same day, John W. Thompson took on the role of chairman, in place of Bill Gates, who continued to participate as a technology advisor.[98] Thompson became the second chairman in Microsoft's history.[99] On April 25, 2014, Microsoft acquired Nokia Devices and Services for $7.2 billion.[100] This new subsidiary was renamed Microsoft Mobile Oy.[101] On September 15, 2014, Microsoft acquired the video game development company Mojang, best known for *Minecraft*, for $2.5 billion.[102] On June 8, 2017, Microsoft acquired Hexadite, an Israeli security firm, for $100 million.[103][104]\n\n\nOn January 21, 2015, Microsoft announced the release of their first Interactive whiteboard, Microsoft Surface Hub.[105] On July 29, 2015, Windows 10 was released,[106] with its server sibling, Windows Server 2016, released in September 2016. In Q1 2015, Microsoft was the third largest maker of mobile phones, selling 33 million units (7.2% of all). While a large majority (at least 75%) of them do not run any version of Windows Phone— those other phones are not categorized as smartphones by Gartner – in the same time frame 8 million Windows smartphones (2.5% of all smartphones) were made by all manufacturers (but mostly by Microsoft).[107] Microsoft's share of the U.S. smartphone market in January 2016 was 2.7%.[108] During the summer of 2015 the company lost $7.6 billion related to its mobile-phone business, firing 7,800 employees.[109]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2016, Microsoft announced the merger of its PC and Xbox divisions, with Phil Spencer announcing that Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps would be the focus for Microsoft's gaming in the future.[110] On January 24, 2017, Microsoft showcased Intune for Education at the BETT 2017 education technology conference in London.[111] Intune for Education is a new cloud-based application and device management service for the education sector.[112] In May 2016, the company announced it was laying off 1,850 workers, and taking an impairment and restructuring charge of $950 million.[109] In June 2016, Microsoft announced a project named Microsoft Azure Information Protection. It aims to help enterprises protect their data as it moves between servers and devices.[113] In November 2016, Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member during Microsoft's Connect(); developer event in New York.[114] The cost of each Platinum membership is US$500,000 per year.[115] Some analysts deemed this unthinkable ten years prior, however, as in 2001 then-CEO Steve Ballmer called Linux \"cancer\".[116] Microsoft planned to launch a preview of Intune for Education \"in the coming weeks,\" with general availability scheduled for spring 2017, priced at $30 per device, or through volume licensing agreements.[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Nokia Lumia 1320, the Microsoft Lumia 535 and the Nokia Lumia 530, which all run on one of the now-discontinued Windows Phone operating systems\nIn January 2018, Microsoft patched Windows 10 to account for CPU problems related to Intel's Meltdown security breach. The patch led to issues with the Microsoft Azure virtual machines reliant on Intel's CPU architecture. On January 12, Microsoft released PowerShell Core 6.0 for the macOS and Linux operating systems.[118] In February 2018, Microsoft killed notification support for their Windows Phone devices which effectively ended firmware updates for the discontinued devices.[118] In March 2018, Microsoft recalled Windows 10 S to change it to a mode for the Windows operating system rather than a separate and unique operating system. In March the company also established guidelines that censor users of Office 365 from using profanity in private documents.[118] In April 2018, Microsoft released the source code for Windows File Manager under the MIT License to celebrate the program's 20th anniversary. In April the company further expressed willingness to embrace open source initiatives by announcing Azure Sphere as its own derivative of the Linux operating system.[118] In May 2018, Microsoft partnered with 17 American intelligence agencies to develop cloud computing products. The project is dubbed \"Azure Government\" and has ties to the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) surveillance program.[118] On June 4, 2018, Microsoft officially announced the acquisition of GitHub for $7.5 billion, a deal that closed on October 26, 2018.[119][120] On July 10, 2018, Microsoft revealed the Surface Go platform to the public. Later in the month, it converted Microsoft Teams to gratis.[118] In August 2018, Microsoft released two projects called Microsoft AccountGuard and Defending Democracy.

Developed in part by researchers from Kindai University, the water pump mechanisms use artificial intelligence to count the number of fish on a conveyor belt, analyze the number of fish, and deduce the effectiveness of water flow from the data the fish provide. The specific computer programs used in the process fall under the Azure Machine Learning and the Azure IoT Hub platforms.[123] In September 2018, Microsoft discontinued Skype Classic.[118] On October 10, 2018, Microsoft joined the Open Invention Network community despite holding more than 60,000 patents.[124] In November 2018, Microsoft agreed to supply 100,000 Microsoft HoloLens headsets to the United States military in order to \"increase lethality by enhancing the ability to detect, decide and engage before the enemy.\"[125] In November 2018, Microsoft introduced Azure Multi-Factor Authentication for Microsoft Azure.[126] In December 2018, Microsoft announced Project Mu, an open source release of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) core used in Microsoft Surface and Hyper-V products. The project promotes the idea of Firmware as a Service.[127] In the same month, Microsoft announced the open source implementation of Windows Forms and the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) which will allow for further movement of the company toward the transparent release of key frameworks used in developing Windows desktop applications and software. December also saw the company discontinue the Microsoft Edge project in favor of Chromium backends for their browsers.[126]\n\n\nOn February 20, 2019, Microsoft Corp said it will offer its cyber security service AccountGuard to 12 new markets in Europe including Germany, France and Spain, to close security gaps and protect customers in political space from hacking.[128] In February 2019, hundreds of Microsoft employees protested the company's war profiteering from a $480 million contract to develop virtual reality headsets for the United States Army.[129]\n\n\n\n### 2020–present: Acquisitions, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows 11[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft\n\nOn March 26, 2020, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Affirmed Networks for about $1.35 billion.[130][131] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft closed all of its retail stores indefinitely due to health concerns.[132] On July 22, 2020, Microsoft announced plans to close its Mixer service, planning to move existing partners to Facebook Gaming.[133]\n\n\nOn July 31, 2020, it was reported that Microsoft was in talks to acquire TikTok after the Trump administration ordered ByteDance to divest ownership of the application to the U.S.[134] On August 3, 2020, after speculation on the deal, Donald Trump stated that Microsoft could buy the application, however, it should be completed by September 15, 2020, and that the United States Department of the Treasury should receive a portion if it were to go through.[135]\n\n\nOn August 5, 2020, Microsoft stopped its xCloud game streaming test for iOS devices. According to Microsoft, the future of xCloud on iOS remains unclear and potentially out of Microsoft's hands. Apple has imposed a strict limit on \"remote desktop clients\" which means applications are only allowed to connect to a user-owned host device or gaming console owned by the user.[136] On September 21, 2020, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire video game company ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, for about $7.5 billion, with the deal expected to occur in the second half of 2021 fiscal year.[137] On March 9, 2021, the acquisition was finalized and ZeniMax Media became part of Microsoft's Xbox Game Studios division.[138] The total price of the deal was $8.1 billion.[139]\n\n\nOn September 22, 2020, Microsoft announced that it had an exclusive license to use OpenAI's GPT-3 artificial intelligence language generator.[140] The previous version of GPT-3, called GPT-2, made headlines for being \"too dangerous to release\" and had numerous capabilities, including designing websites, prescribing medication, answering questions, and penning articles.[141] On November 10, 2020, Microsoft released the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S video game consoles.[142]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Microsoft announced it would buy Nuance Communications for approximately $16 billion.[143] The acquisition of Nuance was completed in March 2022.[144] In 2021, in part due to the strong quarterly earnings spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft's valuation came to nearly $2 trillion. The increased necessity for remote work and distance education drove demand for cloud computing and grew the company's gaming sales.[145][146][147]\n\n\nOn June 24, 2021, Microsoft announced Windows 11 during a Livestream. The announcement came with confusion after Microsoft announced Windows 10 would be the last version of the operating system; set to be released in the third quarter of 2021.[148] It was released to the general public on October 5, 2021.[149]\n\n\nIn early September 2021, it was announced that the company had acquired Takelessons, an online platform which connects students and tutors in numerous subjects.

Microsoft has not released statements regarding Activision's recent legal controversies regarding employee abuse, but reports have alleged that Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, a major target of the controversy, will leave the company after the acquisition is finalized.[158] The deal was closed on October 13, 2023.[159]\n\n\nIn December 2022, Microsoft announced a new 10-year deal with the London Stock Exchange for products including Microsoft Azure; Microsoft acquired ~4% of the LSE as part of the deal.[160]\n\n\nIn January 2023, CEO Satya Nadella announced Microsoft would lay off some 10,000 employees.[161] The announcement came a day after hosting a Sting concert for 50 people, including Microsoft executives, in Davos, Switzerland.[162]\n\n\nOn January 23, 2023, Microsoft announced a new multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment deal with ChatGPT developer OpenAI.[163]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Microsoft; Internet censorship in China; and Embrace, extend, and extinguish\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nThe company is run by a board of directors made up of mostly company outsiders, as is customary for publicly traded companies. Members of the board of directors as of July 2020 are Satya Nadella, Reid Hoffman, Hugh Johnston, Teri List-Stoll, Sandi Peterson, Penny Pritzker, Charles Scharf, Arne Sorenson, John W. Stanton, John W. Thompson, Emma Walmsley and Padmasree Warrior.[164] Board members are elected every year at the annual shareholders' meeting using a majority vote system. There are four committees within the board that oversee more specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues with the company including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the Governance and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters including the nomination of the board; and the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee, which includes legal/antitrust matters, along with privacy, trade, digital safety, artificial intelligence, and environmental sustainability.[165]\n\n\nOn March 13, 2020, Gates announced that he is leaving the board of directors of Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus more on his philanthropic efforts. According to Aaron Tilley of *The Wall Street Journal* this is \"marking the biggest boardroom departure in the tech industry since the death of longtime rival and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs.\"[166]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft's board of directors plans to hire an external law firm to review its sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, and to release a summary of how the company handled past allegations of misconduct against Bill Gates and other corporate executives.[167]\n\n\n\n### Chief executives[edit]\n\n\n1.

As of July 2010, with the company's nine stock splits, any IPO shares would be multiplied by 288; if one were to buy the IPO today, given the splits and other factors, it would cost about 9 cents.[13]: 235–236[169][170] The stock price peaked in 1999 at around $119 ($60.928, adjusting for splits).[171] The company began to offer a dividend on January 16, 2003, starting at eight cents per share for the fiscal year followed by a dividend of sixteen cents per share the subsequent year, switching from yearly to quarterly dividends in 2005 with eight cents a share per quarter and a special one-time payout of three dollars per share for the second quarter of the fiscal year.[171][172] Though the company had subsequent increases in dividend payouts, the price of Microsoft's stock remained steady for years.[172][173]\n\n\nStandard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service have both given a AAA rating to Microsoft, whose assets were valued at $41 billion as compared to only $8.5 billion in unsecured debt. Consequently, in February 2011 Microsoft released a corporate bond amounting to $2.25 billion with relatively low borrowing rates compared to government bonds.[174] For the first time in 20 years Apple Inc. surpassed Microsoft in Q1 2011 quarterly profits and revenues due to a slowdown in PC sales and continuing huge losses in Microsoft's Online Services Division (which contains its search engine Bing). Microsoft profits were $5.2 billion, while Apple Inc. profits were $6 billion, on revenues of $14.5 billion and $24.7 billion respectively.[175] Microsoft's Online Services Division has been continuously loss-making since 2006 and in Q1 2011 it lost $726 million. This follows a loss of $2.5 billion for the year 2010.[176]\n\n\nOn July 20, 2012, Microsoft posted its first quarterly loss ever, despite earning record revenues for the quarter and fiscal year, with a net loss of $492 million due to a writedown related to the advertising company aQuantive, which had been acquired for $6.2 billion back in 2007.[177] As of January 2014, Microsoft's market capitalization stood at $314B,[178] making it the 8th largest company in the world by market capitalization.[179] On November 14, 2014, Microsoft overtook ExxonMobil to become the second most-valuable company by market capitalization, behind only Apple Inc. Its total market value was over $410B—with the stock price hitting $50.04 a share, the highest since early 2000.[180] In 2015, Reuters reported that Microsoft Corp had earnings abroad of $76.4 billion which were untaxed by the Internal Revenue Service.

The two-year contract may result in follow-on orders of more than 100,000 headsets, according to documentation describing the bidding process. One of the contract's tag lines for the augmented reality technology seems to be its ability to enable \"25 bloodless battles before the 1st battle,\" suggesting that actual combat training is going to be an essential aspect of the augmented reality headset capabilities.[184]\n\n\n\n### Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nMicrosoft is an international business. As such, it needs subsidiaries present in whatever national markets it chooses to harvest. An example is Microsoft Canada, which it established in 1985.[185] Other countries have similar installations, to funnel profits back up to Redmond and to distribute the dividends to the holders of MSFT stock.\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Windows 8 Launch Event in Akihabara, Tokyo on October 25, 2012\nIn 2004, Microsoft commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of Windows Server 2003 to Linux; the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than Linux, thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company (i.e. lower TCO).[186] This spurred a wave of related studies; a study by the Yankee Group concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the switching costs from Windows Server to Linux, although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and concern about being locked into using Microsoft products.[187] Another study, released by the Open Source Development Labs, claimed that the Microsoft studies were \"simply outdated and one-sided\" and their survey concluded that the TCO of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other reasons.[188]\n\n\nAs part of the \"Get the Facts\" campaign, Microsoft highlighted the .NET Framework trading platform that it had developed in partnership with Accenture for the London Stock Exchange, claiming that it provided \"five nines\" reliability. After suffering extended downtime and unreliability[189][190] the London Stock Exchange announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a Linux-based one in 2010.[191][192]\n\n\nIn 2012, Microsoft hired a political pollster named Mark Penn, whom *The New York Times* called \"famous for bulldozing\" his political opponents[193] as Executive Vice-president, Advertising and Strategy. Penn created a series of negative advertisements targeting one of Microsoft's chief competitors, Google. The advertisements, called \"Scroogled,\" attempt to make the case that Google is \"screwing\" consumers with search results rigged to favor Google's paid advertisers, that Gmail violates the privacy of its users to place ad results related to the content of their emails and shopping results, which favor Google products. Tech publications like TechCrunch have been highly critical of the advertising campaign,[194] while Google employees have embraced it.[195]\n\n\n\n### Layoffs[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2014, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 18,000 employees. Microsoft employed 127,104 people as of June 5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest Microsoft lay off ever. This included 12,500 professional and factory personnel. Previously, Microsoft had eliminated 5,800 jobs in 2009 in line with the Great Recession of 2008–2017.[196][197] In September 2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle–Redmond area, where the company is headquartered. The firings came as a second wave of the layoffs that were previously announced. This brought the total number to over 15,000 out of the 18,000 expected cuts.[198] In October 2014, Microsoft revealed that it was almost done with the elimination of 18,000 employees, which was its largest-ever layoff sweep.[199] In July 2015, Microsoft announced another 7,800 job cuts in the next several months.[200] In May 2016, Microsoft announced another 1,850 job cuts mostly in its Nokia mobile phone division. As a result, the company will record an impairment and restructuring charge of approximately $950 million, of which approximately $200 million will relate to severance payments.[201]\n\n\n\n### United States government[edit]\n\n\nMicrosoft provides information about reported bugs in their software to intelligence agencies of the United States government, prior to the public release of the fix. A Microsoft spokesperson has stated that the corporation runs several programs that facilitate the sharing of such information with the U.S. government.[202] Following media reports about PRISM, NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in May 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Microsoft.[203] According to leaks of said program, Microsoft joined the PRISM program in 2007.[204] However, in June 2013, an official statement from Microsoft flatly denied their participation in the program: \n\n\n> \"We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so, and never on a voluntary basis. In addition, we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers. If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data, we don't participate in it.\"[205]\n> \n> \n\n\nDuring the first six months of 2013, Microsoft received requests that affected between 15,000 and 15,999 accounts.[206] In December 2013, the company made a statement to further emphasize the fact that they take their customers' privacy and data protection very seriously, even saying that \"government snooping potentially now constitutes an 'advanced persistent threat,' alongside sophisticated malware and cyber attacks\".[207] The statement also marked the beginning of three-part program to enhance Microsoft's encryption and transparency efforts. On July 1, 2014, as part of this program they opened the first (of many) Microsoft Transparency Center, which provides \"participating governments with the ability to review source code for our key products, assure themselves of their software integrity, and confirm there are no \"back doors.\"[208] Microsoft has also argued that the United States Congress should enact strong privacy regulations to protect consumer data.[209]\n\n\nIn April 2016, the company sued the U.S. government, argued that secrecy orders were preventing the company from disclosing warrants to customers in violation of the company's and customers' rights. Microsoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents and that the Fourth Amendment made it so people or businesses had the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property. On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit as a result of a policy change by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ). The DoJ had \"changed data request rules on alerting the Internet users about agencies accessing their information.\"\n\n\n\n## Corporate identity[edit]\n\n\n### Corporate culture[edit]\n\n\nTechnical references for developers and articles for various Microsoft magazines such as *Microsoft Systems Journal* (MSJ) are available through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). MSDN also offers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer access to pre-release beta versions of Microsoft software.[210][211] In April 2004, Microsoft launched a community site for developers and users, titled Channel 9, that provides a wiki and an Internet forum.[212] Another community site that provides daily videocasts and other services, On10.net, launched on March 3, 2006.[213] Free technical support is traditionally provided through online Usenet newsgroups, and CompuServe in the past, monitored by Microsoft employees; there can be several newsgroups for a single product. Helpful people can be elected by peers or Microsoft employees for Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) status, which entitles them to a sort of special social status and possibilities for awards and other benefits.[214]\n\n\nNoted for its internal lexicon, the expression \"eating your own dog food\" is used to describe the policy of using pre-release and beta versions of products inside Microsoft in an effort to test them in \"real-world\" situations.[215] This is usually shortened to just \"dog food\" and is used as a noun, verb, and adjective. Another bit of jargon, FYIFV or FYIV (\"Fuck You, I'm [Fully] Vested\"), is used by an employee to indicate they are financially independent and can avoid work anytime they wish.[216]\n\n\nMicrosoft is an outspoken opponent of the cap on H-1B visas, which allows companies in the U.S. to employ certain foreign workers. Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas makes it difficult to hire employees for the company, stating \"I'd certainly get rid of the H1B cap\" in 2005.[217] Critics of H1B visas argue that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment for U.S. citizens due to H1B workers working for lower salaries.[218]\n\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, a report of how progressive the organization deems company policies towards LGBT employees, rated Microsoft as 87% from 2002 to 2004 and as 100% from 2005 to 2010 after they allowed gender expression.[219]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Microsoft implemented a policy for all companies providing subcontractors to require 12 weeks of paid parental leave to each employee. This expands on the former requirement from 2015 requiring 15 days of paid vacation and sick leave each year.[220] In 2015, Microsoft established its own parental leave policy to allow 12 weeks off for parental leave with an additional 8 weeks for the parent who gave birth.[221]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Greenpeace released a report rating the top ten big brands in cloud computing on their sources of electricity for their data centers. At the time, data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity, and this amount was projected to increase. Phil Radford of Greenpeace said \"we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today,\"[222] and called on \"Amazon, Microsoft and other leaders of the information-technology industry must embrace clean energy to power their cloud-based data centers.\"[223] In 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy power generated by a Texas wind project to power one of its data centers.[224] Microsoft is ranked on the 17th place in Greenpeace's *Guide to Greener Electronics* (16th Edition) that ranks 18 electronics manufacturers according to their policies on toxic chemicals, recycling, and climate change.[225] Microsoft's timeline for phasing out brominated flame retardant (BFRs) and phthalates in all products is 2012 but its commitment to phasing out PVC is not clear. As of January 2011,[update] it has no products that are completely free from PVC and BFRs.[226]\n\n\nMicrosoft's main U.S. campus received a silver certification from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program in 2008, and it installed over 2,000 solar panels on top of its buildings at its Silicon Valley campus, generating approximately 15 percent of the total energy needed by the facilities in April 2005.[227] Microsoft makes use of alternative forms of transit. It created one of the world's largest private bus systems, the \"Connector,\" to transport people from outside the company; for on-campus transportation, the \"Shuttle Connect\" uses a large fleet of hybrid cars to save fuel. The “Connector” does not compete with the public bus system and works with it to provide a cohesive transportation network not just for its employees but also for the public.[228] The company also subsidizes regional public transport, provided by Sound Transit and King County Metro, as an incentive.[227][229] In February 2010, however, Microsoft took a stance against adding additional public transport and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to the State Route 520 and its floating bridge connecting Redmond to Seattle; the company did not want to delay the construction any further.[230] Microsoft was ranked number 1 in the list of the World's Best Multinational Workplaces by the Great Place to Work Institute in 2011.[231]\n\n\nIn January 2020, the company announced a strategy to take the company carbon negative by 2030 and to remove all carbon that it has emitted since its foundation in 1975.[232][233][234] On October 9, 2020, Microsoft permanently allowed remote work.[235] In January 2021, the company announced on Twitter to join the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, which engages the cloud infrastructure and data centers industries to reach carbon neutrality in Europe by 2030, and also disclosed an investment in Climeworks, a direct air capture company partnered with Carbfix for carbon sequestration.[list 1] In the same year, it was awarded the EPA's Green Power Leadership Award, citing the company's use of 100 percent renewable energy since 2014.[241] In September 2023, Microsoft announced that it purchased $200 million in carbon credits to offset 315,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide over 10 years from Heirloom Carbon, a carbon removal company that mixes calcium oxide from heated crushed limestone with water to form carbon hydroxide to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to mineralize back into limestone while the released carbon dioxide is stored underground or injected into concrete.[242][243]\n\n\n\n### Headquarters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The west campus of the Microsoft Redmond campus\nThe corporate headquarters, informally known as the Microsoft Redmond campus, is located at One Microsoft Way in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, weeks before the company went public on March 13. The headquarters has since experienced multiple expansions since its establishment. It is estimated to encompass over 8 million ft2 (750,000 m2) of office space and 30,000–40,000 employees.[244] Additional offices are located in Bellevue and Issaquah, Washington (90,000 employees worldwide). The company is planning to upgrade its Mountain View, California, campus on a grand scale. The company has occupied this campus since 1981. In 2016, the company bought the 32-acre (13 ha) campus, with plans to renovate and expand it by 25%.[245] Microsoft operates an East Coast headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina,[246] where the construction of a data center led to the destruction of a historic black cemetery.[247]\n\n\n\n### Flagship stores[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Microsoft's Toronto flagship store\nOn October 26, 2015, the company opened its retail location on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The location features a five-story glass storefront and is 22,270 square feet.[248] As per company executives, Microsoft had been on the lookout for a flagship location since 2009.[249] The company's retail locations are part of a greater strategy to help build a connection with its consumers. The opening of the store coincided with the launch of the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4.[250] On November 12, 2015, Microsoft opened a second flagship store, located in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall.[251]\n\n\n\n### Logo[edit]\n\n\nMicrosoft adopted the so-called \"*Pac-Man* Logo,\" designed by Scott Baker, in 1987. Baker stated \"The new logo, in Helvetica italic typeface, has a slash between the *o* and *s* to emphasize the \"soft\" part of the name and convey motion and speed.\"[252] Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter *O*, nicknamed the *blibbet*, but it was discarded.[253] Microsoft's logo with the tagline \"Your potential. Our passion.\"—below the main corporate name—is based on a slogan Microsoft used in 2008. In 2002, the company started using the logo in the United States and eventually started a television campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of *\"Where do you want to go today?\"*[254][255][256] During the private MGX (Microsoft Global Exchange) conference in 2010, Microsoft unveiled the company's next tagline, *\"Be What's Next.\"*[257] They also had a slogan/tagline \"Making it all make sense.\"[258]\n\n\nOn August 23, 2012, Microsoft unveiled a new corporate logo at the opening of its 23rd Microsoft store in Boston, indicating the company's shift of focus from the classic style to the tile-centric modern interface, which it uses/will use on the Windows Phone platform, Xbox 360, Windows 8 and the upcoming Office Suites.[259] The new logo also includes four squares with the colors of the then-current Windows logo which have been used to represent Microsoft's four major products: Windows (blue), Office (orange), Xbox (green) and Bing (yellow).[260] The logo also resembles the opening of one of the commercials for Windows 95.[261][262]\n\n\n\n* Microsoft logo history\n* ![1975–1980: First Microsoft logo, in 1975](image)\n\n1975–1980: First Microsoft logo, in 1975\n* ![1980–1982: Second Microsoft logo, in 1980](image)\n\n1980–1982: Second Microsoft logo, in 1980\n* ![1982–1987: Third Microsoft logo, in 1982](image)\n\n1982–1987: Third Microsoft logo, in 1982\n* ![1987–2012: Microsoft \"Pac-Man\" logo, designed by Scott Baker and used from 1987 to 2012[254][255]](image)\n\n1987–2012: Microsoft \"Pac-Man\" logo, designed by Scott Baker and used from 1987 to 2012[254][255]\n* ![2012–present: Fifth Microsoft logo, introduced on August 23, 2012[263]](image)\n\n2012–present: Fifth Microsoft logo, introduced on August 23, 2012[263]\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![Toyota Yaris WRC.jpg](image)Toyota Yaris WRC\nThe company was the official jersey sponsor of Finland's national basketball team at EuroBasket 2015.[264]\n\n\nThe company was a major sponsor of the Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT (2017–2020).\n\n\nThe company was a sponsor of the Renault F1 Team (2016–2020).\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, announced that an initial batch of supplies, including 15,000 protection goggles, infrared thermometers, medical caps, and protective suits, was donated to Seattle, with further aid to come soon.[265]\n\n\nDuring 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Microsoft started monitoring cyberattacks originating from the Russian government and Russia-backed hackers. In June 2022, Microsoft published the report on Russian cyber attacks, and concluded that state-backed Russian hackers \"have engaged in \"strategic espionage\" against governments, think tanks, businesses and aid groups\" in 42 countries supporting Kyiv.[266][267]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Microsoft litigation and Criticism of Microsoft\n\nCriticism of Microsoft has followed various aspects of its products and business practices. Frequently criticized are the ease of use, robustness, and security of the company's software. They have also been criticized for the use of permatemp employees (employees employed for years as \"temporary,\" and therefore without medical benefits), the use of forced retention tactics, which means that employees would be sued if they tried to leave.[268] Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking employees, in many cases, leading to burnout within just a few years of joining the company. The company is often referred to as a \"Velvet Sweatshop,\" a term which originated in a 1989 *Seattle Times* article,[269] and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft's own employees.[270] This characterization is derived from the perception that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its employees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their (possibly long-term) health.\n\n\nAs reported by several news outlets,[271][272] an Irish subsidiary of Microsoft based in the Republic of Ireland declared £220 bn in profits but paid no corporation tax for the year 2020. This is due to the company being tax resident in Bermuda as mentioned in the accounts for 'Microsoft Round Island One, a subsidiary that collects license fees from the use of Microsoft software worldwide. Dame Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP in the UK said, \"It is unsurprising – yet still shocking – that massively wealthy global corporations openly, unashamedly and blatantly refuse to pay tax on the profits they make in the countries where they undertake business\".[272]\n\n\nIn 2020, ProPublica reported that the company had diverted more than $39 billion in U.S. profits to Puerto Rico using a mechanism structured to make it seem as if the company was unprofitable on paper. As a result, the company paid a tax rate on those profits of \"nearly 0%.\" When the Internal Revenue Service audited these transactions, ProPublica reported that Microsoft aggressively fought back, including successfully lobbying Congress to change the law to make it harder for the agency to conduct audits of large corporations.[273][274]\n\n\n\"Embrace, extend, and extinguish\" (EEE),[275] also known as \"embrace, extend, and exterminate,\"[276] is a phrase that the U.S. Department of Justice found[277] that was used internally by Microsoft[278] to describe its strategy for entering product categories involving widely used standards, extending those standards with proprietary capabilities, and then using those differences to strongly disadvantage competitors. Microsoft is frequently accused of using anticompetitive tactics and abusing its monopolistic power. People who use their products and services often end up becoming dependent on them, a process is known as vendor lock-in.\n\n\nMicrosoft was the first company to participate in the PRISM surveillance program, according to leaked NSA documents obtained by *The Guardian*[279] and *The Washington Post*[280] in June 2013, and acknowledged by government officials following the leak.[281] The program authorizes the government to secretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Microsoft has denied participation in such a program.[282]\n\n\nJesse Jackson believes Microsoft should hire more minorities and women. In 2015, he praised Microsoft for appointing two women to its board of directors.[283]\n\n\nIn 2020, Salesforce, the manufacturer of the Slack platform, complained to European regulators about Microsoft due to the integration of the Teams service into Office 365. Negotiations with the European Commission continued until the summer of 2023, but, as it became known to the media, they reached an impasse. Microsoft is now facing an antitrust investigation.[284]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Microsoft software\n* Microsoft hardware\n* List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft\n* Microsoft engineering groups\n* Microsoft Enterprise Agreement\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Microsoft Corporation Form 10-K\".

Microsoft's best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, and the Edge web browser. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No. 14 in the 2022 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue;[2] it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of 2022. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, and Meta.\n\n\nMicrosoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made several corporate acquisitions, the largest being the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in October 2023,[3] followed by its acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[4] and its acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.[5]\n\n\nAs of 2015[update], Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android.[6] The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio).\n\n\nSteve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000 and later envisioned a \"devices and services\" strategy.[7] This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008,[8] entering the personal computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped the company's shares reach their highest value since December 1999.[9][10] Under Nadella's direction, the company has also heavily expanded it's gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the Microsoft Gaming division in 2022, dedicated to operating Xbox in addition to it's three subsidiaries (publishers). Microsoft Gaming is the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue as of 2023.[11]\n\n\nEarlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018, Microsoft reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.[12] In April 2019, Microsoft reached a trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon, respectively. As of 2023[update], Microsoft has the third-highest global brand valuation.\n\n\nMicrosoft has been criticized for its monopolistic practices and the company's software has been criticized for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Microsoft\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Microsoft.\n\n### 1972–1985: Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An Altair 8800 computer (left) with the popular Model 33 ASR Teletype as terminal, paper tape reader, and paper tape punch\n![](image)Paul Allen and Bill Gates on October 19, 1981, after signing a pivotal contract with IBM[13]: 228\n![](image)Bill Gates and Paul Allen's Original Business Cards located in the Microsoft Visitor Center.\nChildhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen sought to make a business using their skills in computer programming.[14] In 1972, they founded Traf-O-Data, which sold a rudimentary computer to track and analyze automobile traffic data. Gates enrolled at Harvard University while Allen pursued a degree in computer science at Washington State University, though he later dropped out to work at Honeywell.[15] The January 1975 issue of *Popular Electronics* featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems's (MITS) Altair 8800 microcomputer,[16] which inspired Allen to suggest that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device. Gates called MITS and claimed that he had a working interpreter, and MITS requested a demonstration. Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter, and it worked flawlessly when they demonstrated it to MITS in March 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC.[13]: 108, 112–114 Gates and Allen established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as CEO,[17] and Allen suggested the name \"Micro-Soft,\" short for micro-computer software.[18][19] In August 1977, the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office of ASCII Microsoft.[20] Microsoft moved its headquarters to Bellevue, Washington, in January 1979.[17]\n\n\nMicrosoft entered the operating system (OS) business in 1980 with its own version of Unix called Xenix,[21] but it was MS-DOS that solidified the company's dominance. IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M OS to be used in the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC).[22] For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products which it branded as MS-DOS, although IBM rebranded it to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981. IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, so other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor.[23][24]: 210 The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as with a publishing division named Microsoft Press.[13]: 232\nPaul Allen resigned from Microsoft in 1983 after developing Hodgkin's lymphoma.[25] Allen claimed in *Idea Man: A Memoir by the Co-founder of Microsoft* that Gates wanted to dilute his share in the company when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease because he did not think that he was working hard enough.[26] Allen later invested in low-tech sectors, sports teams, commercial real estate, neuroscience, private space flight, and more.[27]\n\n\n\n### 1985–1994: Windows and Office[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Windows 1.0 was released on November 20, 1985, as the first version of the Windows line.\nMicrosoft released Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical extension for MS-DOS,[13]: 242–243, 246 despite having begun jointly developing OS/2 with IBM the previous August.[28] Microsoft moved its headquarters from Bellevue to Redmond, Washington, on February 26, 1986, and went public on March 13,[29] with the resulting rise in stock making an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees.[30] Microsoft released its version of OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on April 2, 1987.[13] In 1990, the Federal Trade Commission examined Microsoft for possible collusion due to the partnership with IBM, marking the beginning of more than a decade of legal clashes with the government.[31] : 243–244 Meanwhile, the company was at work on Microsoft Windows NT, which was heavily based on their copy of the OS/2 code. It shipped on July 21, 1993, with a new modular kernel and the 32-bit Win32 application programming interface (API), making it easier to port from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based) Windows. Microsoft informed IBM of Windows NT, and the OS/2 partnership deteriorated.[32]\n\n\nIn 1990, Microsoft introduced the Microsoft Office suite which bundled separate applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.[13]: 301 On May 22, Microsoft launched Windows 3.0, featuring streamlined user interface graphics and improved protected mode capability for the Intel 386 processor,[33] and both Office and Windows became dominant in their respective areas.[34][35]\n\n\nOn July 27, 1994, the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division filed a competitive impact statement that said: \"Beginning in 1988 and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti-competitive 'per processor licenses. Under a per-processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM's use of a competing PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft's use of per processor licenses has increased.\"[36]\n\n\n\n### 1995–2007: Foray into the Web, Windows 95, Windows XP, and Xbox[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 1996, Microsoft released Windows CE, a version of the operating system meant for personal digital assistants and other tiny computers, shown here on the HP 300LX.\nFollowing Bill Gates's internal \"Internet Tidal Wave memo\" on May 26, 1995, Microsoft began to redefine its offerings and expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web.[37] With a few exceptions of new companies, like Netscape, Microsoft was the only major and established company that acted fast enough to be a part of the World Wide Web practically from the start. Other companies like Borland, WordPerfect, Novell, IBM and Lotus, being much slower to adapt to the new situation, would give Microsoft market dominance.[38] The company released Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, featuring pre-emptive multitasking, a completely new user interface with a novel start button, and 32-bit compatibility; similar to NT, it provided the Win32 API.[39][40]: 20 Windows 95 came bundled with the online service MSN, which was at first intended to be a competitor to the Internet,[*dubious – discuss*] and (for OEMs) Internet Explorer, a Web browser. Internet Explorer has not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes, because the boxes were printed before the team finished the Web browser, and instead were included in the Windows 95 Plus! pack.[41] Backed by a high-profile marketing campaign[42] and what *The New York Times* called \"the splashiest, most frenzied, most expensive introduction of a computer product in the industry's history,\"[43] Windows 95 quickly became a success.[44] Branching out into new markets in 1996, Microsoft and General Electric's NBC unit created a new 24/7 cable news channel, MSNBC.[45] Microsoft created Windows CE 1.0, a new OS designed for devices with low memory and other constraints, such as personal digital assistants.[46] In October 1997, the Justice Department filed a motion in the Federal District Court, stating that Microsoft violated an agreement signed in 1994 and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.[13]: 323–324\n\n\n\n![](image)Microsoft released the first installment in the Xbox series of consoles in 2001. The Xbox, graphically powerful compared to its rivals, featured a standard PC's 733 MHz Intel Pentium III processor.\nOn January 13, 2000, Bill Gates handed over the CEO position to Steve Ballmer, an old college friend of Gates and employee of the company since 1980, while creating a new position for himself as Chief Software Architect.[13]: 111, 228[17] Various companies including Microsoft formed the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance in October 1999 to (among other things) increase security and protect intellectual property through identifying changes in hardware and software. Critics decried the alliance as a way to enforce indiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software, and over how computers behave, and as a form of digital rights management: for example, the scenario where a computer is not only secured for its owner but also secured against its owner as well.[47][48] On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the case of *United States v. Microsoft Corp.*,[49] calling the company an \"abusive monopoly.\"[50] Microsoft later settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2004.[29] On October 25, 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP, unifying the mainstream and NT lines of OS under the NT codebase.[51] The company released the Xbox later that year, entering the video game console market dominated by Sony and Nintendo.[52] In March 2004 the European Union brought antitrust legal action against the company, citing it abused its dominance with the Windows OS, resulting in a judgment of €497 million ($613 million) and requiring Microsoft to produce new versions of Windows XP without Windows Media Player: Windows XP Home Edition N and Windows XP Professional N.[53][54] In November 2005, the company's second video game console, the Xbox 360, was released. There were two versions, a basic version for $299.99 and a deluxe version for $399.99.[55]\n\n\nIncreasingly present in the hardware business following Xbox, Microsoft 2006 released the Zune series of digital media players, a successor of its previous software platform Portable Media Center. These expanded on previous hardware commitments from Microsoft following its original Microsoft Mouse in 1983; as of 2007 the company sold the best-selling wired keyboard (Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000), mouse (IntelliMouse), and desktop webcam (LifeCam) in the United States. That year the company also launched the Surface \"digital table\", later renamed PixelSense.[56]\n\n\n\n### 2007–2011: Microsoft Azure, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Microsoft Stores[edit]\n\n\n![](image)CEO Steve Ballmer at the MIX event in 2008. In an interview about his management style in 2005, he mentioned that his first priority was to get the people he delegates to in order. Ballmer also emphasized the need to continue pursuing new technologies even if initial attempts fail, citing the original attempts with Windows as an example.[57]\n![](image)Headquarters of the European Commission, which has imposed several fines on Microsoft\nReleased in January 2007, the next version of Windows, Vista, focused on features, security and a redesigned user interface dubbed Aero.[58][59] Microsoft Office 2007, released at the same time, featured a \"Ribbon\" user interface which was a significant departure from its predecessors. Relatively strong sales of both products helped to produce a record profit in 2007.[60] The European Union imposed another fine of €899 million ($1.4 billion) for Microsoft's lack of compliance with the March 2004 judgment on February 27, 2008, saying that the company charged rivals unreasonable prices for key information about its workgroup and backoffice servers.[61] Microsoft stated that it was in compliance and that \"these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved\".[62] 2007 also saw the creation of a multi-core unit at Microsoft, following the steps of server companies such as Sun and IBM.[63]\n\n\nGates retired from his role as Chief Software Architect on June 27, 2008, a decision announced in June 2006, while retaining other positions related to the company in addition to being an advisor for the company on key projects.[64][65] Azure Services Platform, the company's entry into the cloud computing market for Windows, launched on October 27, 2008.[66] On February 12, 2009, Microsoft announced its intent to open a chain of Microsoft-branded retail stores, and on October 22, 2009, the first retail Microsoft Store opened in Scottsdale, Arizona; the same day Windows 7 was officially released to the public. Windows 7's focus was on refining Vista with ease-of-use features and performance enhancements, rather than an extensive reworking of Windows.[67][68][69]\n\n\nAs the smartphone industry boomed in the late 2000s, Microsoft had struggled to keep up with its rivals in providing a modern smartphone operating system, falling behind Apple and Google-sponsored Android in the United States.[70] As a result, in 2010 Microsoft revamped their aging flagship mobile operating system, Windows Mobile, replacing it with the new Windows Phone OS that was released in October that year.[71][72] It used a new user interface design language, codenamed \"Metro,\" which prominently used simple shapes, typography, and iconography, utilizing the concept of minimalism. Microsoft implemented a new strategy for the software industry, providing a consistent user experience across all smartphones using the Windows Phone OS. It launched an alliance with Nokia in 2011 and Microsoft worked closely with the company to co-develop Windows Phone,[73] but remained partners with long-time Windows Mobile OEM HTC.[74] Microsoft is a founding member of the Open Networking Foundation started on March 23, 2011. Fellow founders were Google, HP Networking, Yahoo!, Verizon Communications, Deutsche Telekom and 17 other companies. This nonprofit organization is focused on providing support for a cloud computing initiative called Software-Defined Networking.[75] The initiative is meant to speed innovation through simple software changes in telecommunications networks, wireless networks, data centers, and other networking areas.[76]\n\n\n\n### 2011–2014: Windows 8/8.1, Xbox One, Outlook.com, and Surface devices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Surface Pro 3, part of the Surface series of laplets by Microsoft\nFollowing the release of Windows Phone, Microsoft undertook a gradual rebranding of its product range throughout 2011 and 2012, with the corporation's logos, products, services, and websites adopting the principles and concepts of the Metro design language.[77] Microsoft unveiled Windows 8, an operating system designed to power both personal computers and tablet computers, in Taipei in June 2011.[78] A developer preview was released on September 13, which was subsequently replaced by a consumer preview on February 29, 2012, and released to the public in May.[79] The Surface was unveiled on June 18, becoming the first computer in the company's history to have its hardware made by Microsoft.[80][81] On June 25, Microsoft paid US$1.2 billion to buy the social network Yammer.[82] On July 31, they launched the Outlook.com webmail service to compete with Gmail.[83] On September 4, 2012, Microsoft released Windows Server 2012.[84]\n\n\nIn July 2012, Microsoft sold its 50% stake in MSNBC, which it had run as a joint venture with NBC since 1996.[85] On October 1, Microsoft announced its intention to launch a news operation, part of a new-look MSN, with Windows 8 later in the month.[86] On October 26, 2012, Microsoft launched Windows 8 and the Microsoft Surface.[81][87] Three days later, Windows Phone 8 was launched.[88] To cope with the potential for an increase in demand for products and services, Microsoft opened a number of \"holiday stores\" across the U.S. to complement the increasing number of \"bricks-and-mortar\" Microsoft Stores that opened in 2012.[89] On March 29, 2013, Microsoft launched a Patent Tracker.[90]\n\n\nIn August 2012, the New York City Police Department announced a partnership with Microsoft for the development of the Domain Awareness System which is used for Police surveillance in New York City.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Xbox One console, released in 2013\nThe Kinect, a motion-sensing input device made by Microsoft and designed as a video game controller, first introduced in November 2010, was upgraded for the 2013 release of the Xbox One video game console. Kinect's capabilities were revealed in May 2013: an ultra-wide 1080p camera, function in the dark due to an infrared sensor, higher-end processing power and new software, the ability to distinguish between fine movements (such as a thumb movement), and determining a user's heart rate by looking at their face.[92] Microsoft filed a patent application in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the Kinect camera system to monitor the behavior of television viewers as part of a plan to make the viewing experience more interactive. On July 19, 2013, Microsoft stocks suffered their biggest one-day percentage sell-off since the year 2000, after its fourth-quarter report raised concerns among investors on the poor showings of both Windows 8 and the Surface tablet. Microsoft suffered a loss of more than US$32 billion.[93]\n\n\nIn line with the maturing PC business, in July 2013, Microsoft announced that it would reorganize the business into four new business divisions, namely Operating systems, Apps, Cloud, and Devices. All previous divisions will be dissolved into new divisions without any workforce cuts.[94] On September 3, 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy Nokia's mobile unit for $7 billion,[95] following Amy Hood taking the role of CFO.[96]\n\n\n\n\n### 2014–2020: Windows 10, Microsoft Edge, and HoloLens[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satya Nadella succeeded Steve Ballmer as the CEO of Microsoft in February 2014.\nOn February 4, 2014, Steve Ballmer stepped down as CEO of Microsoft and was succeeded by Satya Nadella, who previously led Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise division.[97] On the same day, John W. Thompson took on the role of chairman, in place of Bill Gates, who continued to participate as a technology advisor.[98] Thompson became the second chairman in Microsoft's history.[99] On April 25, 2014, Microsoft acquired Nokia Devices and Services for $7.2 billion.[100] This new subsidiary was renamed Microsoft Mobile Oy.[101] On September 15, 2014, Microsoft acquired the video game development company Mojang, best known for *Minecraft*, for $2.5 billion.[102] On June 8, 2017, Microsoft acquired Hexadite, an Israeli security firm, for $100 million.[103][104]\n\n\nOn January 21, 2015, Microsoft announced the release of their first Interactive whiteboard, Microsoft Surface Hub.[105] On July 29, 2015, Windows 10 was released,[106] with its server sibling, Windows Server 2016, released in September 2016. In Q1 2015, Microsoft was the third largest maker of mobile phones, selling 33 million units (7.2% of all). While a large majority (at least 75%) of them do not run any version of Windows Phone— those other phones are not categorized as smartphones by Gartner – in the same time frame 8 million Windows smartphones (2.5% of all smartphones) were made by all manufacturers (but mostly by Microsoft).[107] Microsoft's share of the U.S. smartphone market in January 2016 was 2.7%.[108] During the summer of 2015 the company lost $7.6 billion related to its mobile-phone business, firing 7,800 employees.[109]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2016, Microsoft announced the merger of its PC and Xbox divisions, with Phil Spencer announcing that Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps would be the focus for Microsoft's gaming in the future.[110] On January 24, 2017, Microsoft showcased Intune for Education at the BETT 2017 education technology conference in London.[111] Intune for Education is a new cloud-based application and device management service for the education sector.[112] In May 2016, the company announced it was laying off 1,850 workers, and taking an impairment and restructuring charge of $950 million.[109] In June 2016, Microsoft announced a project named Microsoft Azure Information Protection. It aims to help enterprises protect their data as it moves between servers and devices.[113] In November 2016, Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member during Microsoft's Connect(); developer event in New York.[114] The cost of each Platinum membership is US$500,000 per year.[115] Some analysts deemed this unthinkable ten years prior, however, as in 2001 then-CEO Steve Ballmer called Linux \"cancer\".[116] Microsoft planned to launch a preview of Intune for Education \"in the coming weeks,\" with general availability scheduled for spring 2017, priced at $30 per device, or through volume licensing agreements.[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Nokia Lumia 1320, the Microsoft Lumia 535 and the Nokia Lumia 530, which all run on one of the now-discontinued Windows Phone operating systems\nIn January 2018, Microsoft patched Windows 10 to account for CPU problems related to Intel's Meltdown security breach. The patch led to issues with the Microsoft Azure virtual machines reliant on Intel's CPU architecture. On January 12, Microsoft released PowerShell Core 6.0 for the macOS and Linux operating systems.[118] In February 2018, Microsoft killed notification support for their Windows Phone devices which effectively ended firmware updates for the discontinued devices.[118] In March 2018, Microsoft recalled Windows 10 S to change it to a mode for the Windows operating system rather than a separate and unique operating system. In March the company also established guidelines that censor users of Office 365 from using profanity in private documents.[118] In April 2018, Microsoft released the source code for Windows File Manager under the MIT License to celebrate the program's 20th anniversary. In April the company further expressed willingness to embrace open source initiatives by announcing Azure Sphere as its own derivative of the Linux operating system.[118] In May 2018, Microsoft partnered with 17 American intelligence agencies to develop cloud computing products. The project is dubbed \"Azure Government\" and has ties to the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) surveillance program.[118] On June 4, 2018, Microsoft officially announced the acquisition of GitHub for $7.5 billion, a deal that closed on October 26, 2018.[119][120] On July 10, 2018, Microsoft revealed the Surface Go platform to the public. Later in the month, it converted Microsoft Teams to gratis.[118] In August 2018, Microsoft released two projects called Microsoft AccountGuard and Defending Democracy. It also unveiled Snapdragon 850 compatibility for Windows 10 on the ARM architecture.[121][122][118]\n\n\n\n![](image)Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin using a Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality headset in September 2016\nIn August 2018, Toyota Tsusho began a partnership with Microsoft to create fish farming tools using the Microsoft Azure application suite for Internet of things (IoT) technologies related to water management. Developed in part by researchers from Kindai University, the water pump mechanisms use artificial intelligence to count the number of fish on a conveyor belt, analyze the number of fish, and deduce the effectiveness of water flow from the data the fish provide. The specific computer programs used in the process fall under the Azure Machine Learning and the Azure IoT Hub platforms.[123] In September 2018, Microsoft discontinued Skype Classic.[118] On October 10, 2018, Microsoft joined the Open Invention Network community despite holding more than 60,000 patents.[124] In November 2018, Microsoft agreed to supply 100,000 Microsoft HoloLens headsets to the United States military in order to \"increase lethality by enhancing the ability to detect, decide and engage before the enemy.\"[125] In November 2018, Microsoft introduced Azure Multi-Factor Authentication for Microsoft Azure.[126] In December 2018, Microsoft announced Project Mu, an open source release of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) core used in Microsoft Surface and Hyper-V products. The project promotes the idea of Firmware as a Service.[127] In the same month, Microsoft announced the open source implementation of Windows Forms and the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) which will allow for further movement of the company toward the transparent release of key frameworks used in developing Windows desktop applications and software. December also saw the company discontinue the Microsoft Edge project in favor of Chromium backends for their browsers.[126]\n\n\nOn February 20, 2019, Microsoft Corp said it will offer its cyber security service AccountGuard to 12 new markets in Europe including Germany, France and Spain, to close security gaps and protect customers in political space from hacking.[128] In February 2019, hundreds of Microsoft employees protested the company's war profiteering from a $480 million contract to develop virtual reality headsets for the United States Army.[129]\n\n\n\n### 2020–present: Acquisitions, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows 11[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft\n\nOn March 26, 2020, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Affirmed Networks for about $1.35 billion.[130][131] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft closed all of its retail stores indefinitely due to health concerns.[132] On July 22, 2020, Microsoft announced plans to close its Mixer service, planning to move existing partners to Facebook Gaming.[133]\n\n\nOn July 31, 2020, it was reported that Microsoft was in talks to acquire TikTok after the Trump administration ordered ByteDance to divest ownership of the application to the U.S.[134] On August 3, 2020, after speculation on the deal, Donald Trump stated that Microsoft could buy the application, however, it should be completed by September 15, 2020, and that the United States Department of the Treasury should receive a portion if it were to go through.[135]\n\n\nOn August 5, 2020, Microsoft stopped its xCloud game streaming test for iOS devices. According to Microsoft, the future of xCloud on iOS remains unclear and potentially out of Microsoft's hands. Apple has imposed a strict limit on \"remote desktop clients\" which means applications are only allowed to connect to a user-owned host device or gaming console owned by the user.[136] On September 21, 2020, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire video game company ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, for about $7.5 billion, with the deal expected to occur in the second half of 2021 fiscal year.[137] On March 9, 2021, the acquisition was finalized and ZeniMax Media became part of Microsoft's Xbox Game Studios division.[138] The total price of the deal was $8.1 billion.[139]\n\n\nOn September 22, 2020, Microsoft announced that it had an exclusive license to use OpenAI's GPT-3 artificial intelligence language generator.[140] The previous version of GPT-3, called GPT-2, made headlines for being \"too dangerous to release\" and had numerous capabilities, including designing websites, prescribing medication, answering questions, and penning articles.[141] On November 10, 2020, Microsoft released the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S video game consoles.[142]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Microsoft announced it would buy Nuance Communications for approximately $16 billion.[143] The acquisition of Nuance was completed in March 2022.[144] In 2021, in part due to the strong quarterly earnings spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft's valuation came to nearly $2 trillion. The increased necessity for remote work and distance education drove demand for cloud computing and grew the company's gaming sales.[145][146][147]\n\n\nOn June 24, 2021, Microsoft announced Windows 11 during a Livestream. The announcement came with confusion after Microsoft announced Windows 10 would be the last version of the operating system; set to be released in the third quarter of 2021.[148] It was released to the general public on October 5, 2021.[149]\n\n\nIn early September 2021, it was announced that the company had acquired Takelessons, an online platform which connects students and tutors in numerous subjects. The acquisition positioned Microsoft to grow its presence in the market of providing online education to large numbers of people.[150] In the same month, Microsoft acquired Australia-based video editing software company Clipchamp.[151]\n\n\nIn October 2021, Microsoft announced that it began rolling out end-to-end encryption (E2EE) support for Microsoft Teams calls in order to secure business communication while using video conferencing software.

Stanton, John W. Thompson, Emma Walmsley and Padmasree Warrior.[164] Board members are elected every year at the annual shareholders' meeting using a majority vote system. There are four committees within the board that oversee more specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues with the company including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the Governance and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters including the nomination of the board; and the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee, which includes legal/antitrust matters, along with privacy, trade, digital safety, artificial intelligence, and environmental sustainability.[165]\n\n\nOn March 13, 2020, Gates announced that he is leaving the board of directors of Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus more on his philanthropic efforts. According to Aaron Tilley of *The Wall Street Journal* this is \"marking the biggest boardroom departure in the tech industry since the death of longtime rival and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs.\"[166]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft's board of directors plans to hire an external law firm to review its sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, and to release a summary of how the company handled past allegations of misconduct against Bill Gates and other corporate executives.[167]\n\n\n\n### Chief executives[edit]\n\n\n1.

As of July 2010, with the company's nine stock splits, any IPO shares would be multiplied by 288; if one were to buy the IPO today, given the splits and other factors, it would cost about 9 cents.[13]: 235–236[169][170] The stock price peaked in 1999 at around $119 ($60.928, adjusting for splits).[171] The company began to offer a dividend on January 16, 2003, starting at eight cents per share for the fiscal year followed by a dividend of sixteen cents per share the subsequent year, switching from yearly to quarterly dividends in 2005 with eight cents a share per quarter and a special one-time payout of three dollars per share for the second quarter of the fiscal year.[171][172] Though the company had subsequent increases in dividend payouts, the price of Microsoft's stock remained steady for years.[172][173]\n\n\nStandard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service have both given a AAA rating to Microsoft, whose assets were valued at $41 billion as compared to only $8.5 billion in unsecured debt. Consequently, in February 2011 Microsoft released a corporate bond amounting to $2.25 billion with relatively low borrowing rates compared to government bonds.[174] For the first time in 20 years Apple Inc. surpassed Microsoft in Q1 2011 quarterly profits and revenues due to a slowdown in PC sales and continuing huge losses in Microsoft's Online Services Division (which contains its search engine Bing). Microsoft profits were $5.2 billion, while Apple Inc. profits were $6 billion, on revenues of $14.5 billion and $24.7 billion respectively.[175] Microsoft's Online Services Division has been continuously loss-making since 2006 and in Q1 2011 it lost $726 million. This follows a loss of $2.5 billion for the year 2010.[176]\n\n\nOn July 20, 2012, Microsoft posted its first quarterly loss ever, despite earning record revenues for the quarter and fiscal year, with a net loss of $492 million due to a writedown related to the advertising company aQuantive, which had been acquired for $6.2 billion back in 2007.[177] As of January 2014, Microsoft's market capitalization stood at $314B,[178] making it the 8th largest company in the world by market capitalization.[179] On November 14, 2014, Microsoft overtook ExxonMobil to become the second most-valuable company by market capitalization, behind only Apple Inc. Its total market value was over $410B—with the stock price hitting $50.04 a share, the highest since early 2000.[180] In 2015, Reuters reported that Microsoft Corp had earnings abroad of $76.4 billion which were untaxed by the Internal Revenue Service. Under U.S. law, corporations do not pay income tax on overseas profits until the profits are brought into the United States.[181]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenuein mil. US$[182] | Net incomein mil.

The two-year contract may result in follow-on orders of more than 100,000 headsets, according to documentation describing the bidding process. One of the contract's tag lines for the augmented reality technology seems to be its ability to enable \"25 bloodless battles before the 1st battle,\" suggesting that actual combat training is going to be an essential aspect of the augmented reality headset capabilities.[184]\n\n\n\n### Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nMicrosoft is an international business. As such, it needs subsidiaries present in whatever national markets it chooses to harvest. An example is Microsoft Canada, which it established in 1985.[185] Other countries have similar installations, to funnel profits back up to Redmond and to distribute the dividends to the holders of MSFT stock.\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Windows 8 Launch Event in Akihabara, Tokyo on October 25, 2012\nIn 2004, Microsoft commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of Windows Server 2003 to Linux; the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than Linux, thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company (i.e. lower TCO).[186] This spurred a wave of related studies; a study by the Yankee Group concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the switching costs from Windows Server to Linux, although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and concern about being locked into using Microsoft products.[187] Another study, released by the Open Source Development Labs, claimed that the Microsoft studies were \"simply outdated and one-sided\" and their survey concluded that the TCO of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other reasons.[188]\n\n\nAs part of the \"Get the Facts\" campaign, Microsoft highlighted the .NET Framework trading platform that it had developed in partnership with Accenture for the London Stock Exchange, claiming that it provided \"five nines\" reliability. After suffering extended downtime and unreliability[189][190] the London Stock Exchange announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a Linux-based one in 2010.[191][192]\n\n\nIn 2012, Microsoft hired a political pollster named Mark Penn, whom *The New York Times* called \"famous for bulldozing\" his political opponents[193] as Executive Vice-president, Advertising and Strategy. Penn created a series of negative advertisements targeting one of Microsoft's chief competitors, Google. The advertisements, called \"Scroogled,\" attempt to make the case that Google is \"screwing\" consumers with search results rigged to favor Google's paid advertisers, that Gmail violates the privacy of its users to place ad results related to the content of their emails and shopping results, which favor Google products. Tech publications like TechCrunch have been highly critical of the advertising campaign,[194] while Google employees have embraced it.[195]\n\n\n\n### Layoffs[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2014, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 18,000 employees. Microsoft employed 127,104 people as of June 5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest Microsoft lay off ever. This included 12,500 professional and factory personnel. Previously, Microsoft had eliminated 5,800 jobs in 2009 in line with the Great Recession of 2008–2017.[196][197] In September 2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle–Redmond area, where the company is headquartered. The firings came as a second wave of the layoffs that were previously announced. This brought the total number to over 15,000 out of the 18,000 expected cuts.[198] In October 2014, Microsoft revealed that it was almost done with the elimination of 18,000 employees, which was its largest-ever layoff sweep.[199] In July 2015, Microsoft announced another 7,800 job cuts in the next several months.[200] In May 2016, Microsoft announced another 1,850 job cuts mostly in its Nokia mobile phone division. As a result, the company will record an impairment and restructuring charge of approximately $950 million, of which approximately $200 million will relate to severance payments.[201]\n\n\n\n### United States government[edit]\n\n\nMicrosoft provides information about reported bugs in their software to intelligence agencies of the United States government, prior to the public release of the fix. A Microsoft spokesperson has stated that the corporation runs several programs that facilitate the sharing of such information with the U.S. government.[202] Following media reports about PRISM, NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in May 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Microsoft.[203] According to leaks of said program, Microsoft joined the PRISM program in 2007.[204] However, in June 2013, an official statement from Microsoft flatly denied their participation in the program: \n\n\n> \"We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so, and never on a voluntary basis. In addition, we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers. If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data, we don't participate in it.\"[205]\n> \n> \n\n\nDuring the first six months of 2013, Microsoft received requests that affected between 15,000 and 15,999 accounts.[206] In December 2013, the company made a statement to further emphasize the fact that they take their customers' privacy and data protection very seriously, even saying that \"government snooping potentially now constitutes an 'advanced persistent threat,' alongside sophisticated malware and cyber attacks\".[207] The statement also marked the beginning of three-part program to enhance Microsoft's encryption and transparency efforts. On July 1, 2014, as part of this program they opened the first (of many) Microsoft Transparency Center, which provides \"participating governments with the ability to review source code for our key products, assure themselves of their software integrity, and confirm there are no \"back doors.\"[208] Microsoft has also argued that the United States Congress should enact strong privacy regulations to protect consumer data.[209]\n\n\nIn April 2016, the company sued the U.S. government, argued that secrecy orders were preventing the company from disclosing warrants to customers in violation of the company's and customers' rights. Microsoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents and that the Fourth Amendment made it so people or businesses had the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property. On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit as a result of a policy change by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ). The DoJ had \"changed data request rules on alerting the Internet users about agencies accessing their information.\"\n\n\n\n## Corporate identity[edit]\n\n\n### Corporate culture[edit]\n\n\nTechnical references for developers and articles for various Microsoft magazines such as *Microsoft Systems Journal* (MSJ) are available through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). MSDN also offers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer access to pre-release beta versions of Microsoft software.[210][211] In April 2004, Microsoft launched a community site for developers and users, titled Channel 9, that provides a wiki and an Internet forum.[212] Another community site that provides daily videocasts and other services, On10.net, launched on March 3, 2006.[213] Free technical support is traditionally provided through online Usenet newsgroups, and CompuServe in the past, monitored by Microsoft employees; there can be several newsgroups for a single product. Helpful people can be elected by peers or Microsoft employees for Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) status, which entitles them to a sort of special social status and possibilities for awards and other benefits.[214]\n\n\nNoted for its internal lexicon, the expression \"eating your own dog food\" is used to describe the policy of using pre-release and beta versions of products inside Microsoft in an effort to test them in \"real-world\" situations.[215] This is usually shortened to just \"dog food\" and is used as a noun, verb, and adjective. Another bit of jargon, FYIFV or FYIV (\"Fuck You, I'm [Fully] Vested\"), is used by an employee to indicate they are financially independent and can avoid work anytime they wish.[216]\n\n\nMicrosoft is an outspoken opponent of the cap on H-1B visas, which allows companies in the U.S. to employ certain foreign workers. Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas makes it difficult to hire employees for the company, stating \"I'd certainly get rid of the H1B cap\" in 2005.[217] Critics of H1B visas argue that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment for U.S. citizens due to H1B workers working for lower salaries.[218]\n\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, a report of how progressive the organization deems company policies towards LGBT employees, rated Microsoft as 87% from 2002 to 2004 and as 100% from 2005 to 2010 after they allowed gender expression.[219]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Microsoft implemented a policy for all companies providing subcontractors to require 12 weeks of paid parental leave to each employee. This expands on the former requirement from 2015 requiring 15 days of paid vacation and sick leave each year.[220] In 2015, Microsoft established its own parental leave policy to allow 12 weeks off for parental leave with an additional 8 weeks for the parent who gave birth.[221]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Greenpeace released a report rating the top ten big brands in cloud computing on their sources of electricity for their data centers. At the time, data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity, and this amount was projected to increase. Phil Radford of Greenpeace said \"we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today,\"[222] and called on \"Amazon, Microsoft and other leaders of the information-technology industry must embrace clean energy to power their cloud-based data centers.\"[223] In 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy power generated by a Texas wind project to power one of its data centers.[224] Microsoft is ranked on the 17th place in Greenpeace's *Guide to Greener Electronics* (16th Edition) that ranks 18 electronics manufacturers according to their policies on toxic chemicals, recycling, and climate change.[225] Microsoft's timeline for phasing out brominated flame retardant (BFRs) and phthalates in all products is 2012 but its commitment to phasing out PVC is not clear. As of January 2011,[update] it has no products that are completely free from PVC and BFRs.[226]\n\n\nMicrosoft's main U.S. campus received a silver certification from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program in 2008, and it installed over 2,000 solar panels on top of its buildings at its Silicon Valley campus, generating approximately 15 percent of the total energy needed by the facilities in April 2005.[227] Microsoft makes use of alternative forms of transit. It created one of the world's largest private bus systems, the \"Connector,\" to transport people from outside the company; for on-campus transportation, the \"Shuttle Connect\" uses a large fleet of hybrid cars to save fuel. The “Connector” does not compete with the public bus system and works with it to provide a cohesive transportation network not just for its employees but also for the public.[228] The company also subsidizes regional public transport, provided by Sound Transit and King County Metro, as an incentive.[227][229] In February 2010, however, Microsoft took a stance against adding additional public transport and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to the State Route 520 and its floating bridge connecting Redmond to Seattle; the company did not want to delay the construction any further.[230] Microsoft was ranked number 1 in the list of the World's Best Multinational Workplaces by the Great Place to Work Institute in 2011.[231]\n\n\nIn January 2020, the company announced a strategy to take the company carbon negative by 2030 and to remove all carbon that it has emitted since its foundation in 1975.[232][233][234] On October 9, 2020, Microsoft permanently allowed remote work.[235] In January 2021, the company announced on Twitter to join the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, which engages the cloud infrastructure and data centers industries to reach carbon neutrality in Europe by 2030, and also disclosed an investment in Climeworks, a direct air capture company partnered with Carbfix for carbon sequestration.[list 1] In the same year, it was awarded the EPA's Green Power Leadership Award, citing the company's use of 100 percent renewable energy since 2014.[241] In September 2023, Microsoft announced that it purchased $200 million in carbon credits to offset 315,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide over 10 years from Heirloom Carbon, a carbon removal company that mixes calcium oxide from heated crushed limestone with water to form carbon hydroxide to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to mineralize back into limestone while the released carbon dioxide is stored underground or injected into concrete.[242][243]\n\n\n\n### Headquarters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The west campus of the Microsoft Redmond campus\nThe corporate headquarters, informally known as the Microsoft Redmond campus, is located at One Microsoft Way in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, weeks before the company went public on March 13. The headquarters has since experienced multiple expansions since its establishment. It is estimated to encompass over 8 million ft2 (750,000 m2) of office space and 30,000–40,000 employees.[244] Additional offices are located in Bellevue and Issaquah, Washington (90,000 employees worldwide). The company is planning to upgrade its Mountain View, California, campus on a grand scale. The company has occupied this campus since 1981. In 2016, the company bought the 32-acre (13 ha) campus, with plans to renovate and expand it by 25%.[245] Microsoft operates an East Coast headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina,[246] where the construction of a data center led to the destruction of a historic black cemetery.[247]\n\n\n\n### Flagship stores[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Microsoft's Toronto flagship store\nOn October 26, 2015, the company opened its retail location on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The location features a five-story glass storefront and is 22,270 square feet.[248] As per company executives, Microsoft had been on the lookout for a flagship location since 2009.[249] The company's retail locations are part of a greater strategy to help build a connection with its consumers. The opening of the store coincided with the launch of the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4.[250] On November 12, 2015, Microsoft opened a second flagship store, located in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall.[251]\n\n\n\n### Logo[edit]\n\n\nMicrosoft adopted the so-called \"*Pac-Man* Logo,\" designed by Scott Baker, in 1987. Baker stated \"The new logo, in Helvetica italic typeface, has a slash between the *o* and *s* to emphasize the \"soft\" part of the name and convey motion and speed.\"[252] Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter *O*, nicknamed the *blibbet*, but it was discarded.[253] Microsoft's logo with the tagline \"Your potential. Our passion.\"—below the main corporate name—is based on a slogan Microsoft used in 2008. In 2002, the company started using the logo in the United States and eventually started a television campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of *\"Where do you want to go today?\"*[254][255][256] During the private MGX (Microsoft Global Exchange) conference in 2010, Microsoft unveiled the company's next tagline, *\"Be What's Next.\"*[257] They also had a slogan/tagline \"Making it all make sense.\"[258]\n\n\nOn August 23, 2012, Microsoft unveiled a new corporate logo at the opening of its 23rd Microsoft store in Boston, indicating the company's shift of focus from the classic style to the tile-centric modern interface, which it uses/will use on the Windows Phone platform, Xbox 360, Windows 8 and the upcoming Office Suites.[259] The new logo also includes four squares with the colors of the then-current Windows logo which have been used to represent Microsoft's four major products: Windows (blue), Office (orange), Xbox (green) and Bing (yellow).[260] The logo also resembles the opening of one of the commercials for Windows 95.[261][262]\n\n\n\n* Microsoft logo history\n* ![1975–1980: First Microsoft logo, in 1975](image)\n\n1975–1980: First Microsoft logo, in 1975\n* ![1980–1982: Second Microsoft logo, in 1980](image)\n\n1980–1982: Second Microsoft logo, in 1980\n* ![1982–1987: Third Microsoft logo, in 1982](image)\n\n1982–1987: Third Microsoft logo, in 1982\n* ![1987–2012: Microsoft \"Pac-Man\" logo, designed by Scott Baker and used from 1987 to 2012[254][255]](image)\n\n1987–2012: Microsoft \"Pac-Man\" logo, designed by Scott Baker and used from 1987 to 2012[254][255]\n* ![2012–present: Fifth Microsoft logo, introduced on August 23, 2012[263]](image)\n\n2012–present: Fifth Microsoft logo, introduced on August 23, 2012[263]\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![Toyota Yaris WRC.jpg](image)Toyota Yaris WRC\nThe company was the official jersey sponsor of Finland's national basketball team at EuroBasket 2015.[264]\n\n\nThe company was a major sponsor of the Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT (2017–2020).\n\n\nThe company was a sponsor of the Renault F1 Team (2016–2020).\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, announced that an initial batch of supplies, including 15,000 protection goggles, infrared thermometers, medical caps, and protective suits, was donated to Seattle, with further aid to come soon.[265]\n\n\nDuring 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Microsoft started monitoring cyberattacks originating from the Russian government and Russia-backed hackers. In June 2022, Microsoft published the report on Russian cyber attacks, and concluded that state-backed Russian hackers \"have engaged in \"strategic espionage\" against governments, think tanks, businesses and aid groups\" in 42 countries supporting Kyiv.[266][267]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Microsoft litigation and Criticism of Microsoft\n\nCriticism of Microsoft has followed various aspects of its products and business practices. Frequently criticized are the ease of use, robustness, and security of the company's software. They have also been criticized for the use of permatemp employees (employees employed for years as \"temporary,\" and therefore without medical benefits), the use of forced retention tactics, which means that employees would be sued if they tried to leave.[268] Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking employees, in many cases, leading to burnout within just a few years of joining the company. The company is often referred to as a \"Velvet Sweatshop,\" a term which originated in a 1989 *Seattle Times* article,[269] and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft's own employees.[270] This characterization is derived from the perception that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its employees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their (possibly long-term) health.\n\n\nAs reported by several news outlets,[271][272] an Irish subsidiary of Microsoft based in the Republic of Ireland declared £220 bn in profits but paid no corporation tax for the year 2020. This is due to the company being tax resident in Bermuda as mentioned in the accounts for 'Microsoft Round Island One, a subsidiary that collects license fees from the use of Microsoft software worldwide. Dame Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP in the UK said, \"It is unsurprising – yet still shocking – that massively wealthy global corporations openly, unashamedly and blatantly refuse to pay tax on the profits they make in the countries where they undertake business\".[272]\n\n\nIn 2020, ProPublica reported that the company had diverted more than $39 billion in U.S. profits to Puerto Rico using a mechanism structured to make it seem as if the company was unprofitable on paper. As a result, the company paid a tax rate on those profits of \"nearly 0%.\" When the Internal Revenue Service audited these transactions, ProPublica reported that Microsoft aggressively fought back, including successfully lobbying Congress to change the law to make it harder for the agency to conduct audits of large corporations.[273][274]\n\n\n\"Embrace, extend, and extinguish\" (EEE),[275] also known as \"embrace, extend, and exterminate,\"[276] is a phrase that the U.S. Department of Justice found[277] that was used internally by Microsoft[278] to describe its strategy for entering product categories involving widely used standards, extending those standards with proprietary capabilities, and then using those differences to strongly disadvantage competitors. Microsoft is frequently accused of using anticompetitive tactics and abusing its monopolistic power. People who use their products and services often end up becoming dependent on them, a process is known as vendor lock-in.\n\n\nMicrosoft was the first company to participate in the PRISM surveillance program, according to leaked NSA documents obtained by *The Guardian*[279] and *The Washington Post*[280] in June 2013, and acknowledged by government officials following the leak.[281] The program authorizes the government to secretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Microsoft has denied participation in such a program.[282]\n\n\nJesse Jackson believes Microsoft should hire more minorities and women. In 2015, he praised Microsoft for appointing two women to its board of directors.[283]\n\n\nIn 2020, Salesforce, the manufacturer of the Slack platform, complained to European regulators about Microsoft due to the integration of the Teams service into Office 365. Negotiations with the European Commission continued until the summer of 2023, but, as it became known to the media, they reached an impasse. Microsoft is now facing an antitrust investigation.[284]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Microsoft software\n* Microsoft hardware\n* List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft\n* Microsoft engineering groups\n* Microsoft Enterprise Agreement\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Microsoft Corporation Form 10-K\".

It has repeatedly achieved the largest annual profits in global corporate history. Saudi Aramco has both the world's second-largest proven crude oil reserves, at more than 270 billion barrels (43 billion cubic metres),[9] and largest daily oil production of all oil-producing companies.[10][11][12]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco operates the world's largest single hydrocarbon network, the Master Gas System. In 2013, its crude oil production total was 3.4 billion barrels (540 million cubic metres), and it manages over one hundred oil and gas fields in Saudi Arabia, including 288.4 trillion standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas reserves. Along the Eastern Province, Saudi Aramco most notably operates the Ghawar Field (the world's largest onshore oil field) and the Safaniya Field (the world's largest offshore oil field).[13]\n\n\nOn 11 December 2019, the company's shares commenced trading on the Tadawul stock exchange. The shares rose to 35.2 Saudi riyals, giving it a market capitalisation of about US$1.88 trillion,[14] and surpassed the US$2 trillion mark on the second day of trading.[15] In the 2023 Forbes Global 2000, Saudi Aramco was ranked as the second-largest public company in the world.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Dammam No. 7* struck oil in 1938, becoming the first commercial oil well in Saudi Arabia.\nSaudi Aramco's origins trace to the oil shortages of World War I and the exclusion of American companies from Mesopotamia by the United Kingdom and France under the San Remo Petroleum Agreement of 1920.[16] The US administration had popular support for an \"Open Door policy\", which Herbert Hoover, secretary of commerce, initiated in 1921. Standard Oil of California (SoCal) was among those US companies seeking new sources of oil from abroad.[17]\n\n\nThrough its subsidiary company, the Bahrain Petroleum Co. (BAPCO), SoCal struck oil in Bahrain on May 30, 1932. This event heightened interest in the oil prospects of the Arabian mainland. On 29 May 1933, the Saudi Arabian government granted a concession to SoCal in preference to a rival bid from the Iraq Petroleum Co.[18] The concession allowed SoCal to explore for oil in Saudi Arabia. SoCal assigned this concession to a wholly owned subsidiary, California-Arabian Standard Oil (CASOC). In 1936, with the company having had no success at locating oil, the Texas Company (Texaco) purchased a 50% stake of the concession.[19] After four years of fruitless exploration, the first success came with the seventh drill site in Dhahran in 1938, a well referred to as *Dammam No. 7*.[20] This well immediately produced over 1,500 barrels per day (240 m3/d), giving the company confidence to continue. On 31 January 1944, the company name was changed from California-Arabian Standard Oil Co. to Arabian American Oil Co. (or Aramco).[21] In 1948, Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known as Exxon) purchased 30% and Socony Vacuum (later Mobil) purchased 10% of the company, with SoCal and Texaco retaining 30% each.[22] The newcomers were also shareholders in the Iraq Petroleum Co. and had to get the restrictions of the Red Line Agreement lifted in order to be free to enter into this arrangement.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Aramco compound in Saudi Arabia, 1954\nIn 1949, ARAMCO had made incursions into the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, leading to a border dispute between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia.[24]\nIn 1950, King Abdulaziz threatened to nationalize his country's oil facilities, thus pressuring Aramco to agree to share profits 50/50.[25]\n\n\nA similar process had taken place with American oil companies in Venezuela a few years earlier. The American government granted US Aramco member companies a tax break known as the golden gimmick equivalent to the profits given to King Abdulaziz. In the wake of the new arrangement, the company's headquarters were moved from New York to Dhahran.[26] In 1951, the company discovered the Safaniya Oil Field, the world's largest offshore field. In 1957, the discovery of smaller connected oil fields confirmed the Ghawar Field as the world's largest onshore field.[13]\n\n\nIn 1975, the Saudi Arabia second five-year economic plan included a Master Gas Plan. Natural gas would be used to generate power, rather than flaring the gas. The plan counted on using the associated gas, but by 1985, Aramco was able to include a billion standard cubic foot per day (Bscfd) of non-associated gas. This non-associated gas was produced from the Kuff Formation, which is a limestone layer 650 metres (2,130 ft) below the oil producing Arab Zone. In 1994, Aramco discovered more non-associated gas in the deeper Jawf sandstone formation, and built plants in Hawiyah and Haradh to process it. This increased the capacity of the Master Gas System to 9.4 billion scfd.[27]: 98–100, 104, 129–130, 229\n\n\n\n### Yom Kippur War[edit]\n\n\nIn 1973, following US support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War, the Saudi Arabian government acquired a 25% \"participation interest\" in Aramco's assets. It increased its participation interest to 60% in 1974 and acquired the remaining 40% interest in 1976. Aramco continued to operate and manage the former Aramco assets, including its concessionary interest in certain Saudi Arab oil fields, on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government until 1988. In November 1988, a royal decree created a new Saudi Arab company, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, to take control of the former Aramco assets (or Saudi Aramco)[28] and took the management and operations control of Saudi Arabia's oil and gas fields from Aramco and its partners. In 1989–90, high-quality oil and gas were discovered in three areas south of Riyadh: the Raghib area about 77 miles (124 km) southeast of the capital.[29]\n\n\n\n### Persian Gulf War[edit]\n\n\nIn September 1990, after the start of the Persian Gulf War, Aramco was expected to replace much of the oil production removed from the global market due to the embargo of Iraq and occupied Kuwait. This amounted to producing an extra 4.8 million barrels per day (Mbpd) to keep the global oil market stable. In addition, Aramco was expected to provide all of the coalition aviation and diesel needs. Aramco recommissioned 146 Harmaliyah, Khurais, and Ghawar oil wells with associated gas oil separation plants, and saltwater treatment pipeline, that had been mothballed during the 1980s oil price collapse. Daily production increased from 5.4 Mbpd in July to 8.5 Mbpd in December 1990 after a three-month de-mothball effort.[27]: 125, 135, 148–149, 155–156\n\n\nStarting in 1990, Aramco embarked on an expansion of crude oil sales in the Asian market. Agreements with South Korea, the Philippines, and China resulted. By 2016, about 70% of Aramco's crude oil sales were to Asia.[27]: 168, 176, 184–185\n\n\n\n### 2000s[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2001, Saudi Arabia announced the Gas Initiative, which proposed forming three joint ventures with eight IOCs for gas exploration on pure upstream acreage. Core Venture 1 included south Ghawar and north Rub' Al-Khali, Core Venture 2 included the Red Sea, while Core Venture 3 involved Shaybah and Kidan. In 2003, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalEnergies formed a partnership with Saudi Aramco in Core Venture 3. In 2004, Core Venture 1 became three separate joint ventures with Saudi Aramco holding 20%, one with Lukoil, a second with Sinopec, and a third with Repsol.[27]: 228–232\n\n\nBy 2004, Aramco was producing 8.6 million barrels per day (mbpd) out of a potential 10 mbpd. In 2005, Aramco launched a five-year plan to spend US$50 billion to increase their daily capacity to 12.5 mbpd by increasing production and refining capacity and doubling the number of drilling rigs.[27]: 241–242\n\n\nIn 2005, Saudi Aramco was the world's largest company with an estimated market value of US$781 billion.[30]\n\n\nIn June 2008, in response to crude oil prices exceeding US$130 a barrel, Aramco announced it would increase production to 9.7 million barrels per day (mbpd). Then as prices plummeted, Aramco stated in January 2009, that it would reduce production to 7.7 mbpd.[27]: 265–267\n\n\nIn 2011, Saudi Aramco started production from the Karan Gas Field, with an output of more than 400 million scf per day.[31]\n\n\nIn January 2016, the Deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud, announced he was considering listing shares of the state-owned company, and selling around 5% of them in order to build a large sovereign wealth fund.[32]\n\n\nOn 26 April 2017, Saudi security forces thwarted an attempted attack on an Aramco oil distribution center involving an unmanned boat from Yemen.[33]\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in September 2018, Aramco was considering a US$1 billion venture-capital fund to invest in international technology firms.[34]\n\n\nIn June 2019, a report by Financial Times claimed that Aramco had been bearing the ministry-related expenses; boosting the finance ministry budget allocation. It also included Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih’s company-related and diplomatic trips, as well as his stays in luxurious hotels. However, an ally mentioned that Falih’s policies have delivered additional oil revenues that far exceeded his expenses.[35]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Saudi Arabia appointed Yasir Al-Rumayyan as the Chairman of Aramco. Al-Rumayyan became head of the country’s sovereign wealth fund by replacing Khalid Al-Falih, who was holding the position since 2015.[36]\n\n\n\n### 2012 cyber attack[edit]\n\n\nAramco computers were attacked by a virus on 15 August 2012.[37][38] The following day Aramco announced that none of the infected computers were part of the network directly tied to oil production, and that the company would soon resume full operations.[39] Hackers claimed responsibility for the spread of the computer virus.[40] The virus hit companies within the oil and energy sectors.[41][42] A group named \"Cutting Sword of Justice\" claimed responsibility for an attack on 30,000 Saudi Aramco workstations, causing the company to spend months restoring their services.[37] The group later indicated that the Shamoon virus had been used in the attack.[43] Due to this attack, the main site of Aramco went down and a message came to the home page apologizing to customers.[44] Computer security specialists said that \"The attack, known as Shamoon, is said to have hit \"at least one organization\" in the sector. Shamoon is capable of wiping files and rendering several computers on a network unusable.\"[42] Richard Clarke suggests the attack was part of Iran's retaliation for the US involvement in Stuxnet.[45] Security researcher Chris Kubecka, who helped the company establish security after the attack, detailed the level of sophistication in her Black Hat USA 2015 presentation[46][47] and episode 30 of Darknet Diaries.[48]\n\n\n\n### 2019 drone attack[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Abqaiq–Khurais attack\n\nOn 14 September 2019, there was a drone attack on two Saudi Aramco plants:[49] the Abqaiq oil processing facility and Khurais oil field.[50] Houthi rebels[51] claimed responsibility for the attack.[52][53] The attack cut 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of Saudi crude output, over 5% of the world's supply.[54] There were discussions by Saudi Arabian officials on postponing Aramco's IPO, because the attacks \"sidelined more than half of the kingdom's output\" of oil.[55]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Initial public offering (IPO)[edit]\n\n\nSince around 2018, Saudi Arabia had been considering to put a portion of Saudi Aramco's ownership, up to 5%, onto public trading via a staged initial public offering (IPO), as to reduce the cost to the government of running the company. While the IPO had been vetted by major banks, the IPO was delayed over concerns of Aramco's corporate structure through 2018 into 2019.[56] The September 2019 drone attacks on Aramco's facilities also delayed the onset of the IPO.[57]\n\n\nOn 9 April 2019, Aramco issued bonds collectively valued at US$12 billion.[58] Its first international bond issue received more than US$100 billion in orders from foreign investors, which breaks all records for a bond issue by an emerging market entity.[59][60][58]\n\n\nAramco announced on Sunday 3 November 2019 its plan to list 1.5% of its value as an IPO on the Tadawul stock exchange.[61][62]\n\n\nOn 9 November 2019, Saudi Aramco released a 600-page prospectus giving details of the IPO. According to the specifications provided, up to 0.5% of the shares were locked for individual retail investors.[63]\n\n\nOn 4 December 2019, Saudi Aramco priced its offering at 32 Saudi riyals (approximately US$8.53 at the time) per share. The company generated subscriptions of total amount equals US$119 billion representing 456% of total offer shares. It raised US$25.6 billion in its IPO, making it the world's largest IPO, succeeding that of the Alibaba Group in 2014.[64] The company commenced trading on Tadawul on 11 December 2019, with shares rising 10% to 35.2 riyals, giving the company a market capitalisation of about US$1.88 trillion, and making Saudi Aramco the world's largest listed company. The entire Tadawul has a market capitalisation of US$2.22 trillion. [65][66]\n\n\n\n### Global Medium Term Note Programme[edit]\n\n\nAccording to a bourse filing made by Aramco, the like of Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and NCB Capital were hired by the company for organizing investor calls prior to the planned transaction. The document published by one of the other banks said to be involved in the deal showed that the deal included BNP Paribas, MUFG, BofA Securities, SMBC Nikko, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Societe Generale, and BOC International. The company has reported a fall in the net profit of its third-quarter for November 2020, due to increased crude prices and a drop in its demand following the COVID-19 pandemic.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### 2020s[edit]\n\n\nOn 10 March 2020 Saudi Aramco announced a global partnership with Formula One landing a multi year deal.[69]\n\n\nOn 17 June 2020, Saudi Aramco acquired a 70% share in SABIC, a chemicals manufacturing company.[70][71]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Saudi Aramco laid off nearly 500 of its more than 70,000 employees, as global energy firms reduced their workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the workers who lost their job at Aramco were foreigners.[72]\n\n\nOn 31 July 2020, Saudi Aramco lost its title as the world’s largest listed company by market capitalization to Apple.[73]\n\n\nOn 9 August 2020, Saudi Aramco reported a 50% fall in net income for the first half of its financial year, as demand for oil and prices continued to fall due to the coronavirus crisis.[74]\n\n\nOn 3 November 2020, Saudi Aramco reported a 44.6% drop in third-quarter net profit amid the COVID-19 pandemic.[75]\n\n\nOn 14 December 2020, Saudi state TV announced that an oil tanker carrying over 60,000 metric tons of unleaded gasoline from an Aramco refinery at Yanbu, had been attacked by a smaller boat rigged with explosives.[76]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Saudi Aramco announced that earnings in 2020 fell by nearly 45% compared with 2019, as lockdowns around the world following the COVID-19 pandemic curbed demand for oil.[77]\n\n\nOn 19 March 2021, an Aramco refinery was attacked by six bomb-laden drones.[78] The attack, which was claimed by Houthi rebels, started a fire but caused no injuries or damage, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.[79]\n\n\nOn 21 March 2021, Saudi Aramco signed an agreement to secure China's energy supplies for the next 50 years, and also to develop new technologies to combat climate change.[80][81] More recently, they signed a deal with a consortium led by EIG.[82]\n\n\nIn July 2021, Saudi Aramco appointed former HSBC Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver to the company's board of directors.[83]\n\n\nIn October 2021, Saudi Aramco announced plans to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from its wholly-owned operations by 2060.[84]\n\n\nOn 20 November 2021, Houthi fighters took credit for launching 14 drones at military targets in Riyadh, Abha, Jizan, Najran, and Jeddah, and Aramco's refineries in Jeddah.[85][86]\n\n\nIn 2021, *The Guardian* reported that Aramco was not trying to diversify at the same rate as other oil companies, such as Shell and BP.[87] Rather, Aramco announced in 2021 that the company intended to increase crude capacity from 12m barrels a day to 13m barrels by 2027.[87]\n\n\nIn February 2022, following crude's ascent to nearly $95 per barrel, Saudi Arabia's Aramco boosted oil prices for clients in Asia, the United States, and Europe.[88]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Houthi fighters attacked an Aramco storage site in Jeddah causing a fire in two storage tanks.[89] The incident occurred during qualifying for the 2022 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\n\n\nOn 11 May 2022, Saudi Aramco became the largest (most valuable) company in the world by market cap, surpassing Apple Inc.[90]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Saudi Aramco announced that it would acquire Valvoline's petroleum unit for $2.65 billion.[91]\n\n\nIn March 2023, Saudi Aramco announced that they had seen record profits of $161 billion as prices of petrol soared following the COVID-19 pandemic. The figures eclipsed the numbers posted by ExxonMobil and Shell, who reported $55.7 and $39.9 billion in profit respectively.[92]\n\n\nIn September 2023, it was announced Saudi Aramco had reached agreement with the Latin American private equity fund, Southern Cross Group to acquire the Santiago-headquartered fuel retailer, Esmax Distribucion SPA. The acquisition marked Saudi Aramco's entry into the South American fuel retail market.[93]\n\n\n\n## Operation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Exploration\n![](image)Headquarters of Aramco Services Co. in Houston\nSaudi Aramco is headquartered in Dhahran, but its operations span the globe and include exploration, production, refining, chemicals, distribution and marketing. All these activities of the company are monitored by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources together with the Supreme Council for Petroleum and Minerals.[94] However, the ministry has much more responsibility in this regard than the council.[94]\n\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n* Yasir Othman Al-Rumayyan (chairman), member of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs (Saudi Arabia)\n* Ibrahim Abdulaziz Al-Assaf, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Finance\n* Mohammed Al-Jadaan, current Minister of Finance\n* Mohammad M.

Nasser, president and CEO of Saudi Aramco\n\n\n### Exploration[edit]\n\n\nA significant portion of the Saudi Aramco workforce consists of geophysicists and geologists. Saudi Aramco has been exploring for oil and gas reservoirs since 1982. Most of this process takes place at the EXPEC Advanced Research Center. Originally, Saudi Aramco used Cray Supercomputers (CRAY-1M) in its EXPEC Advanced Research Center (ECC)[95] to assist in processing the colossal quantity of data obtained during exploration and in 2001, ECC decided to use Linux clusters as a replacement for the decommissioned Cray systems. ECC installed a new supercomputing system in late 2009 with a disk storage capacity of 1,050 terabytes (i.e, exceeding one petabyte), the largest storage installation in Saudi Aramco's history to support its exploration in the frontier areas and the Red Sea.[96]\n\n\n\n### Refining and chemicals[edit]\n\n\nWhile the company did not originally plan on refining oil, the Saudi government wished to have only one company dealing with oil production. Therefore, on 1 July 1993, the government issued a royal decree merging Saudi Aramco with Samarec, the country's oil refining company. The following year, a Saudi Aramco subsidiary acquired a 40% equity interest in Petron Corporation, the largest crude oil refiner and marketer in the Philippines. Since then, Saudi Aramco has taken on the responsibility of refining oil and distributing it in the country.[13] In 2008, Saudi Aramco sold its entire stake to the Ashmore Group, a London-listed investment group. Ashmore acquired an additional 11% when it made a required tender offer to other shareholders. By July 2008, Ashmore, through its SEA Refinery Holdings B.V., had a 50.57% of Petron's stock. Ashmore's payment was made in December 2008. In December 2008, Ashmore acquired PNOC's 40% stake. In the same month, San Miguel Corporation (SMC) said it was in the final stages of negotiations with the Ashmore Group to buy up to 50.1% of Petron. In 2010, SMC acquired majority control of Petron Corporation.\n\n\nCurrently,[*when?*] Saudi Aramco's refining capacity is 5.4 million barrels per day (860,000 m3/d) (International joint and equity ventures: 2,500 Mbbl/d (400,000,000 m3/d), domestic joint ventures: 1,900 mpbd, and wholly owned domestic operations: 1,000 Mbbl/d (160,000,000 m3/d).)[97]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco's downstream operations are shifting emphasis to integrate refineries with petrochemical facilities. Their first venture into it is with Petro Rabigh, which is a joint venture with Sumitomo Chemical Co. that began in 2005 on the coast of the Red Sea.[13] In order to become a global leader in chemicals, Aramco will acquire 50% of Royal Dutch Shell's stake in their refiner in Saudi Arabia for US$631 million.[98]\n\n\n\n#### List of refineries[edit]\n\n\nList of domestic refineries:[97]\n\n\n\n* Jazan Refinery and terminal projects (JRTP) (400,000 bbl/d (64,000 m3/d)), Jazan construction is ongoing.[99]\n* Jeddah Refinery (78,000 bbl/d (12,400 m3/d)) Jeddah converted to product storage terminal in November 2017.\n* Ras Tanura Refinery (550,000 bbl/d (87,000 m3/d)) (includes a Crude Distillation Unit, a Gas Condensate Unit, a hydrocracker, and catalytic reforming)\n* The Saudi Aramco Jubail Refinery Co.

It used to have its own created subsidiary company, Vela International Marine, which was merged with Bahri company, to handle shipping to North America, Europe, and Asia.[107] It is a stakeholder in the King Salman Global Maritime Industries Complex, a shipyard that will be the largest in the world when complete.[108]\n\n\n\n### Global investment[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco expanded its presence worldwide to include the three major global energy markets of Asia, Europe, and North America.[109] In April 2019, Aramco has signed a deal to acquire a 13% stake in South Korean oil refiner Hyundai Oilbank for US$1.24 billion.[110][111] Moreover, on 11 April 2019, Aramco signed an agreement with Poland’s leading oil refiner PKN Orlen to supply it with Arabian Crude Oil.[112]\n\n\n\n### Liquefied natural gas[edit]\n\n\nAramco is planning to be a major producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the world.[113][114] It sold its first cargo of LNG from Singapore to an Indian buyer.[113] The company is looking globally for potential joint ventures and partnerships to achieve its goal regarding LNG market.[113][114]\n\n\n\n## Saudization[edit]\n\n\nThe original concession agreement included Article 23; as Ali Al-Naimi pointed out, this was a \"key building block in the shaping of Saudi society for decades to come.\" It reads, \"The enterprise under this contract shall be directed and supervised by Americans who shall employ Saudi nationals as far as practicable, and in so far as the company can find suitable Saudi employees it will not employ other nationals.\" The first company school was started in May 1940 in the Al-Khobar home of Hijji bin Jassim, company interpreter, translator and first instructor. Al-Naimi pointed out, \"From the beginning, the development of Aramco was directly tied to the betterment of Saudi Arabia.\" Another school was located in Dhahran in 1941, and was called the Jebel School. Boys hired into entry-level positions attended at 7 AM for four hours, followed by four hours of work in the afternoon. In 1950, Aramco built schools for 2,400 students. In 1959, Aramco sent the first group of Saudi students to college in the States. In 1970, Aramco started hiring its first high school graduates, and in 1979 started offering college scholarships. In 1965, Zafer H. Husseini was named the first Saudi manager and in 1974, Faisal Al-Bassam was named the first Saudi vice president. One of the early students was Al-Naimi, who was named the first Saudi president of Aramco in November 1983. As Al-Naimi states, \"The oil company committed itself to developing qualified Saudis to become fully educated and trained industry professionals.\" Al-Naimi acknowledged Thomas Barger's championing of Saudization, \"You, of all of Aramco's leaders, had the greatest vision when you supported the training effort of Saudi Arab employees during its early days. That visionary support and effort is bearing fruit now and many executive positions are filled by Saudis because of that effort.\" In 1943, 1,600 Saudis were employed at Aramco, but by 1987, nearly two-thirds of Aramco's 43,500 strong workforce were Saudis. In 1988, Al-Naimi became CEO and Hisham Nazer became chairman, the first Saudis to hold those positions. The \"pinnacle of Saudization\" occurred when the Shaybah oil field came on line in July 1998, after a three-year effort by a team consisting of 90% Saudis. The Aramco of 2016 still maintained an expatriate workforce of about 15%, so Aramco can, in the words of Al-Naimi, \"be sure it is getting access to the latest innovations and technical expertise.\"[27]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco has emitted 59.26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent since it began operations, accounting for 4.38% of worldwide anthropogenic CO2 emissions since 1965.[115]\n\n\nIn a letter sent to nine international banks reportedly hired by Aramco to assist it in arranging its US$2 trillion market debut, ten environmental groups warned about the listing causing a highly possible hindrance in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and end human rights abuses committed by the Saudi regime.[116]\n\n\nOn 6 November 2019, Saudi Aramco joined the World Bank's initiative to reduce gas flaring to zero by 2030. The firm reported flaring of less than 1% of its total raw gas production in the first half of 2019.[117]\n\n\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions[edit]\n\n\nAccording to environmentalists Aramco is responsible for more than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions since 1965. Most of this is from the use of the oil they sold, for example burning gasoline in car engines. In greenhouse gas accounting such emissions from use of a product are called \"scope 3\" emissions. Aramco has no plan to limit scope 3 emissions. However the government says it will have net zero carbon emissions by 2060 within the country.[118] In October 2023, Saudi Aramco announced a direct air capture pilot program in partnership with Siemens Energy to be completed in 2024.[119]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### 2007 Haradh gas pipeline explosion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2007 Haradh, Saudi Arabia gas pipeline explosion\n\nOn 18 November 2007, reports came out that a natural gas pipeline explosion had taken the lives of several workers, the death toll was later determined to be 34.[120][121] Aramco asserts it was a purely maintenance-related incident.\n\n\n\n### Organizational culture[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2020, the Financial Times published an article about an engineer, whose family claims that Saudi Aramco was negligent in handling his Covid-19 infection.[122] According to his family, he had been asking the company and authorities for help, three weeks before his death, but was simply asked to keep his gloves and mask on. Saudi Aramco did not formally contact his family until approximately 14 hours after his death, refused to release his body, and allegedly erased information from his mobile phone. His grieving family had to do without financial support for almost five months, and only received $400,000 in benefits, back pay and insurance after the Financial Times had started asking questions.\n\n\nIn the same article, five whistleblowers accuse Aramco of bullying and mismanagement.[122] One former employee expressed his concerns about the company’s highly dangerous failure to pressure-test valves and mains units, detailing cracks in the refinery structure and sinking of roads and foundations. The refinery runs a real risk of becoming Aramco's Piper Alpha, said another expatriate employee, who also accuses Aramco of lacking a culture of challenge, facilitating ineptitude and laziness.\n\n\n\n### Treatment of workers[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Saudi Aramco came under fire after photos of a migrant worker dressed as a large hand-sanitizer dispenser went viral on social media.[123] People on Twitter condemned the act as \"modern-day slavery,\" \"humiliating\" and \"dehumanizing.\"[124] According to the company, the display was organized without the approval of Aramco officials.[124][125]\n\n\n\n### Strong-arming investors[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, sources told the Financial Times that wealthy families of Saudi Arabia had been coerced into joining the Saudi Aramco IPO.[126][127] According to analysts, Aramco could realistically reach a market capitalization of $1 to $1.5 trillion but the Saudis wanted $2 trillion. Oddly, many of those who signed up have relatives that were part of the 2017–2019 Saudi Arabian purge. According to four sources, the Saudi government \"strong-armed\", \"coerced\" or \"bullied\" some of the wealthiest families in the kingdom into becoming cornerstone investors.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Lobbying and research projects[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco has funded almost 500 studies in last five years on energy issues and collaborated with the United States Department of Energy on projects to boost oil production, such as developing more efficient gasoline, enhanced oil recovery and methods to increase the flow of oil from wells. Since 2016, Saudi Arabia has spent around $140 million on lobbying to influence public opinion and policies in the US. In an effort to keep gasoline cars competitive, Saudi Aramco is working on a device which would trap some of the carbon dioxide upon attaching it to cars running on gasoline. Saudi Aramco has partnered with Hyundai to develop a fuel for gas-electric vehicles which will run on petroleum.[128]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Saudi Arabia portal\n* ![icon](image)Energy portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Ghawar\n* Max Steineke\n* Shamoon\n* List of oil fields: All of those located in Saudi Arabia are owned by Saudi Aramco.\n* Abqaiq\n* Aramco Financial Services Company\n* Aramco Training Services Company\n* Golden gimmick\n* Thomas Barger\n* *Discovery!

It has repeatedly achieved the largest annual profits in global corporate history. Saudi Aramco has both the world's second-largest proven crude oil reserves, at more than 270 billion barrels (43 billion cubic metres),[9] and largest daily oil production of all oil-producing companies.[10][11][12]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco operates the world's largest single hydrocarbon network, the Master Gas System. In 2013, its crude oil production total was 3.4 billion barrels (540 million cubic metres), and it manages over one hundred oil and gas fields in Saudi Arabia, including 288.4 trillion standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas reserves. Along the Eastern Province, Saudi Aramco most notably operates the Ghawar Field (the world's largest onshore oil field) and the Safaniya Field (the world's largest offshore oil field).[13]\n\n\nOn 11 December 2019, the company's shares commenced trading on the Tadawul stock exchange. The shares rose to 35.2 Saudi riyals, giving it a market capitalisation of about US$1.88 trillion,[14] and surpassed the US$2 trillion mark on the second day of trading.[15] In the 2023 Forbes Global 2000, Saudi Aramco was ranked as the second-largest public company in the world.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Dammam No. 7* struck oil in 1938, becoming the first commercial oil well in Saudi Arabia.\nSaudi Aramco's origins trace to the oil shortages of World War I and the exclusion of American companies from Mesopotamia by the United Kingdom and France under the San Remo Petroleum Agreement of 1920.[16] The US administration had popular support for an \"Open Door policy\", which Herbert Hoover, secretary of commerce, initiated in 1921. Standard Oil of California (SoCal) was among those US companies seeking new sources of oil from abroad.[17]\n\n\nThrough its subsidiary company, the Bahrain Petroleum Co. (BAPCO), SoCal struck oil in Bahrain on May 30, 1932. This event heightened interest in the oil prospects of the Arabian mainland. On 29 May 1933, the Saudi Arabian government granted a concession to SoCal in preference to a rival bid from the Iraq Petroleum Co.[18] The concession allowed SoCal to explore for oil in Saudi Arabia. SoCal assigned this concession to a wholly owned subsidiary, California-Arabian Standard Oil (CASOC). In 1936, with the company having had no success at locating oil, the Texas Company (Texaco) purchased a 50% stake of the concession.[19] After four years of fruitless exploration, the first success came with the seventh drill site in Dhahran in 1938, a well referred to as *Dammam No. 7*.[20] This well immediately produced over 1,500 barrels per day (240 m3/d), giving the company confidence to continue. On 31 January 1944, the company name was changed from California-Arabian Standard Oil Co. to Arabian American Oil Co. (or Aramco).[21] In 1948, Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known as Exxon) purchased 30% and Socony Vacuum (later Mobil) purchased 10% of the company, with SoCal and Texaco retaining 30% each.[22] The newcomers were also shareholders in the Iraq Petroleum Co. and had to get the restrictions of the Red Line Agreement lifted in order to be free to enter into this arrangement.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Aramco compound in Saudi Arabia, 1954\nIn 1949, ARAMCO had made incursions into the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, leading to a border dispute between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia.[24]\nIn 1950, King Abdulaziz threatened to nationalize his country's oil facilities, thus pressuring Aramco to agree to share profits 50/50.[25]\n\n\nA similar process had taken place with American oil companies in Venezuela a few years earlier. The American government granted US Aramco member companies a tax break known as the golden gimmick equivalent to the profits given to King Abdulaziz. In the wake of the new arrangement, the company's headquarters were moved from New York to Dhahran.[26] In 1951, the company discovered the Safaniya Oil Field, the world's largest offshore field. In 1957, the discovery of smaller connected oil fields confirmed the Ghawar Field as the world's largest onshore field.[13]\n\n\nIn 1975, the Saudi Arabia second five-year economic plan included a Master Gas Plan. Natural gas would be used to generate power, rather than flaring the gas. The plan counted on using the associated gas, but by 1985, Aramco was able to include a billion standard cubic foot per day (Bscfd) of non-associated gas. This non-associated gas was produced from the Kuff Formation, which is a limestone layer 650 metres (2,130 ft) below the oil producing Arab Zone. In 1994, Aramco discovered more non-associated gas in the deeper Jawf sandstone formation, and built plants in Hawiyah and Haradh to process it. This increased the capacity of the Master Gas System to 9.4 billion scfd.[27]: 98–100, 104, 129–130, 229\n\n\n\n### Yom Kippur War[edit]\n\n\nIn 1973, following US support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War, the Saudi Arabian government acquired a 25% \"participation interest\" in Aramco's assets. It increased its participation interest to 60% in 1974 and acquired the remaining 40% interest in 1976. Aramco continued to operate and manage the former Aramco assets, including its concessionary interest in certain Saudi Arab oil fields, on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government until 1988. In November 1988, a royal decree created a new Saudi Arab company, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, to take control of the former Aramco assets (or Saudi Aramco)[28] and took the management and operations control of Saudi Arabia's oil and gas fields from Aramco and its partners. In 1989–90, high-quality oil and gas were discovered in three areas south of Riyadh: the Raghib area about 77 miles (124 km) southeast of the capital.[29]\n\n\n\n### Persian Gulf War[edit]\n\n\nIn September 1990, after the start of the Persian Gulf War, Aramco was expected to replace much of the oil production removed from the global market due to the embargo of Iraq and occupied Kuwait. This amounted to producing an extra 4.8 million barrels per day (Mbpd) to keep the global oil market stable. In addition, Aramco was expected to provide all of the coalition aviation and diesel needs. Aramco recommissioned 146 Harmaliyah, Khurais, and Ghawar oil wells with associated gas oil separation plants, and saltwater treatment pipeline, that had been mothballed during the 1980s oil price collapse. Daily production increased from 5.4 Mbpd in July to 8.5 Mbpd in December 1990 after a three-month de-mothball effort.[27]: 125, 135, 148–149, 155–156\n\n\nStarting in 1990, Aramco embarked on an expansion of crude oil sales in the Asian market. Agreements with South Korea, the Philippines, and China resulted. By 2016, about 70% of Aramco's crude oil sales were to Asia.[27]: 168, 176, 184–185\n\n\n\n### 2000s[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2001, Saudi Arabia announced the Gas Initiative, which proposed forming three joint ventures with eight IOCs for gas exploration on pure upstream acreage. Core Venture 1 included south Ghawar and north Rub' Al-Khali, Core Venture 2 included the Red Sea, while Core Venture 3 involved Shaybah and Kidan. In 2003, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalEnergies formed a partnership with Saudi Aramco in Core Venture 3. In 2004, Core Venture 1 became three separate joint ventures with Saudi Aramco holding 20%, one with Lukoil, a second with Sinopec, and a third with Repsol.[27]: 228–232\n\n\nBy 2004, Aramco was producing 8.6 million barrels per day (mbpd) out of a potential 10 mbpd. In 2005, Aramco launched a five-year plan to spend US$50 billion to increase their daily capacity to 12.5 mbpd by increasing production and refining capacity and doubling the number of drilling rigs.[27]: 241–242\n\n\nIn 2005, Saudi Aramco was the world's largest company with an estimated market value of US$781 billion.[30]\n\n\nIn June 2008, in response to crude oil prices exceeding US$130 a barrel, Aramco announced it would increase production to 9.7 million barrels per day (mbpd). Then as prices plummeted, Aramco stated in January 2009, that it would reduce production to 7.7 mbpd.[27]: 265–267\n\n\nIn 2011, Saudi Aramco started production from the Karan Gas Field, with an output of more than 400 million scf per day.[31]\n\n\nIn January 2016, the Deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud, announced he was considering listing shares of the state-owned company, and selling around 5% of them in order to build a large sovereign wealth fund.[32]\n\n\nOn 26 April 2017, Saudi security forces thwarted an attempted attack on an Aramco oil distribution center involving an unmanned boat from Yemen.[33]\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in September 2018, Aramco was considering a US$1 billion venture-capital fund to invest in international technology firms.[34]\n\n\nIn June 2019, a report by Financial Times claimed that Aramco had been bearing the ministry-related expenses; boosting the finance ministry budget allocation. It also included Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih’s company-related and diplomatic trips, as well as his stays in luxurious hotels. However, an ally mentioned that Falih’s policies have delivered additional oil revenues that far exceeded his expenses.[35]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Saudi Arabia appointed Yasir Al-Rumayyan as the Chairman of Aramco. Al-Rumayyan became head of the country’s sovereign wealth fund by replacing Khalid Al-Falih, who was holding the position since 2015.[36]\n\n\n\n### 2012 cyber attack[edit]\n\n\nAramco computers were attacked by a virus on 15 August 2012.[37][38] The following day Aramco announced that none of the infected computers were part of the network directly tied to oil production, and that the company would soon resume full operations.[39] Hackers claimed responsibility for the spread of the computer virus.[40] The virus hit companies within the oil and energy sectors.[41][42] A group named \"Cutting Sword of Justice\" claimed responsibility for an attack on 30,000 Saudi Aramco workstations, causing the company to spend months restoring their services.[37] The group later indicated that the Shamoon virus had been used in the attack.[43] Due to this attack, the main site of Aramco went down and a message came to the home page apologizing to customers.[44] Computer security specialists said that \"The attack, known as Shamoon, is said to have hit \"at least one organization\" in the sector. Shamoon is capable of wiping files and rendering several computers on a network unusable.\"[42] Richard Clarke suggests the attack was part of Iran's retaliation for the US involvement in Stuxnet.[45] Security researcher Chris Kubecka, who helped the company establish security after the attack, detailed the level of sophistication in her Black Hat USA 2015 presentation[46][47] and episode 30 of Darknet Diaries.[48]\n\n\n\n### 2019 drone attack[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Abqaiq–Khurais attack\n\nOn 14 September 2019, there was a drone attack on two Saudi Aramco plants:[49] the Abqaiq oil processing facility and Khurais oil field.[50] Houthi rebels[51] claimed responsibility for the attack.[52][53] The attack cut 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of Saudi crude output, over 5% of the world's supply.[54] There were discussions by Saudi Arabian officials on postponing Aramco's IPO, because the attacks \"sidelined more than half of the kingdom's output\" of oil.[55]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Initial public offering (IPO)[edit]\n\n\nSince around 2018, Saudi Arabia had been considering to put a portion of Saudi Aramco's ownership, up to 5%, onto public trading via a staged initial public offering (IPO), as to reduce the cost to the government of running the company. While the IPO had been vetted by major banks, the IPO was delayed over concerns of Aramco's corporate structure through 2018 into 2019.[56] The September 2019 drone attacks on Aramco's facilities also delayed the onset of the IPO.[57]\n\n\nOn 9 April 2019, Aramco issued bonds collectively valued at US$12 billion.[58] Its first international bond issue received more than US$100 billion in orders from foreign investors, which breaks all records for a bond issue by an emerging market entity.[59][60][58]\n\n\nAramco announced on Sunday 3 November 2019 its plan to list 1.5% of its value as an IPO on the Tadawul stock exchange.[61][62]\n\n\nOn 9 November 2019, Saudi Aramco released a 600-page prospectus giving details of the IPO. According to the specifications provided, up to 0.5% of the shares were locked for individual retail investors.[63]\n\n\nOn 4 December 2019, Saudi Aramco priced its offering at 32 Saudi riyals (approximately US$8.53 at the time) per share. The company generated subscriptions of total amount equals US$119 billion representing 456% of total offer shares. It raised US$25.6 billion in its IPO, making it the world's largest IPO, succeeding that of the Alibaba Group in 2014.[64] The company commenced trading on Tadawul on 11 December 2019, with shares rising 10% to 35.2 riyals, giving the company a market capitalisation of about US$1.88 trillion, and making Saudi Aramco the world's largest listed company. The entire Tadawul has a market capitalisation of US$2.22 trillion. [65][66]\n\n\n\n### Global Medium Term Note Programme[edit]\n\n\nAccording to a bourse filing made by Aramco, the like of Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and NCB Capital were hired by the company for organizing investor calls prior to the planned transaction. The document published by one of the other banks said to be involved in the deal showed that the deal included BNP Paribas, MUFG, BofA Securities, SMBC Nikko, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Societe Generale, and BOC International. The company has reported a fall in the net profit of its third-quarter for November 2020, due to increased crude prices and a drop in its demand following the COVID-19 pandemic.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### 2020s[edit]\n\n\nOn 10 March 2020 Saudi Aramco announced a global partnership with Formula One landing a multi year deal.[69]\n\n\nOn 17 June 2020, Saudi Aramco acquired a 70% share in SABIC, a chemicals manufacturing company.[70][71]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Saudi Aramco laid off nearly 500 of its more than 70,000 employees, as global energy firms reduced their workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the workers who lost their job at Aramco were foreigners.[72]\n\n\nOn 31 July 2020, Saudi Aramco lost its title as the world’s largest listed company by market capitalization to Apple.[73]\n\n\nOn 9 August 2020, Saudi Aramco reported a 50% fall in net income for the first half of its financial year, as demand for oil and prices continued to fall due to the coronavirus crisis.[74]\n\n\nOn 3 November 2020, Saudi Aramco reported a 44.6% drop in third-quarter net profit amid the COVID-19 pandemic.[75]\n\n\nOn 14 December 2020, Saudi state TV announced that an oil tanker carrying over 60,000 metric tons of unleaded gasoline from an Aramco refinery at Yanbu, had been attacked by a smaller boat rigged with explosives.[76]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Saudi Aramco announced that earnings in 2020 fell by nearly 45% compared with 2019, as lockdowns around the world following the COVID-19 pandemic curbed demand for oil.[77]\n\n\nOn 19 March 2021, an Aramco refinery was attacked by six bomb-laden drones.[78] The attack, which was claimed by Houthi rebels, started a fire but caused no injuries or damage, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.[79]\n\n\nOn 21 March 2021, Saudi Aramco signed an agreement to secure China's energy supplies for the next 50 years, and also to develop new technologies to combat climate change.[80][81] More recently, they signed a deal with a consortium led by EIG.[82]\n\n\nIn July 2021, Saudi Aramco appointed former HSBC Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver to the company's board of directors.[83]\n\n\nIn October 2021, Saudi Aramco announced plans to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from its wholly-owned operations by 2060.[84]\n\n\nOn 20 November 2021, Houthi fighters took credit for launching 14 drones at military targets in Riyadh, Abha, Jizan, Najran, and Jeddah, and Aramco's refineries in Jeddah.[85][86]\n\n\nIn 2021, *The Guardian* reported that Aramco was not trying to diversify at the same rate as other oil companies, such as Shell and BP.[87] Rather, Aramco announced in 2021 that the company intended to increase crude capacity from 12m barrels a day to 13m barrels by 2027.[87]\n\n\nIn February 2022, following crude's ascent to nearly $95 per barrel, Saudi Arabia's Aramco boosted oil prices for clients in Asia, the United States, and Europe.[88]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Houthi fighters attacked an Aramco storage site in Jeddah causing a fire in two storage tanks.[89] The incident occurred during qualifying for the 2022 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\n\n\nOn 11 May 2022, Saudi Aramco became the largest (most valuable) company in the world by market cap, surpassing Apple Inc.[90]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Saudi Aramco announced that it would acquire Valvoline's petroleum unit for $2.65 billion.[91]\n\n\nIn March 2023, Saudi Aramco announced that they had seen record profits of $161 billion as prices of petrol soared following the COVID-19 pandemic. The figures eclipsed the numbers posted by ExxonMobil and Shell, who reported $55.7 and $39.9 billion in profit respectively.[92]\n\n\nIn September 2023, it was announced Saudi Aramco had reached agreement with the Latin American private equity fund, Southern Cross Group to acquire the Santiago-headquartered fuel retailer, Esmax Distribucion SPA. The acquisition marked Saudi Aramco's entry into the South American fuel retail market.[93]\n\n\n\n## Operation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Exploration\n![](image)Headquarters of Aramco Services Co. in Houston\nSaudi Aramco is headquartered in Dhahran, but its operations span the globe and include exploration, production, refining, chemicals, distribution and marketing. All these activities of the company are monitored by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources together with the Supreme Council for Petroleum and Minerals.[94] However, the ministry has much more responsibility in this regard than the council.[94]\n\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n* Yasir Othman Al-Rumayyan (chairman), member of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs (Saudi Arabia)\n* Ibrahim Abdulaziz Al-Assaf, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Finance\n* Mohammed Al-Jadaan, current Minister of Finance\n* Mohammad M.

Nasser, president and CEO of Saudi Aramco\n\n\n### Exploration[edit]\n\n\nA significant portion of the Saudi Aramco workforce consists of geophysicists and geologists. Saudi Aramco has been exploring for oil and gas reservoirs since 1982. Most of this process takes place at the EXPEC Advanced Research Center. Originally, Saudi Aramco used Cray Supercomputers (CRAY-1M) in its EXPEC Advanced Research Center (ECC)[95] to assist in processing the colossal quantity of data obtained during exploration and in 2001, ECC decided to use Linux clusters as a replacement for the decommissioned Cray systems. ECC installed a new supercomputing system in late 2009 with a disk storage capacity of 1,050 terabytes (i.e, exceeding one petabyte), the largest storage installation in Saudi Aramco's history to support its exploration in the frontier areas and the Red Sea.[96]\n\n\n\n### Refining and chemicals[edit]\n\n\nWhile the company did not originally plan on refining oil, the Saudi government wished to have only one company dealing with oil production. Therefore, on 1 July 1993, the government issued a royal decree merging Saudi Aramco with Samarec, the country's oil refining company. The following year, a Saudi Aramco subsidiary acquired a 40% equity interest in Petron Corporation, the largest crude oil refiner and marketer in the Philippines. Since then, Saudi Aramco has taken on the responsibility of refining oil and distributing it in the country.[13] In 2008, Saudi Aramco sold its entire stake to the Ashmore Group, a London-listed investment group. Ashmore acquired an additional 11% when it made a required tender offer to other shareholders. By July 2008, Ashmore, through its SEA Refinery Holdings B.V., had a 50.57% of Petron's stock. Ashmore's payment was made in December 2008. In December 2008, Ashmore acquired PNOC's 40% stake. In the same month, San Miguel Corporation (SMC) said it was in the final stages of negotiations with the Ashmore Group to buy up to 50.1% of Petron. In 2010, SMC acquired majority control of Petron Corporation.\n\n\nCurrently,[*when?*] Saudi Aramco's refining capacity is 5.4 million barrels per day (860,000 m3/d) (International joint and equity ventures: 2,500 Mbbl/d (400,000,000 m3/d), domestic joint ventures: 1,900 mpbd, and wholly owned domestic operations: 1,000 Mbbl/d (160,000,000 m3/d).)[97]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco's downstream operations are shifting emphasis to integrate refineries with petrochemical facilities. Their first venture into it is with Petro Rabigh, which is a joint venture with Sumitomo Chemical Co. that began in 2005 on the coast of the Red Sea.[13] In order to become a global leader in chemicals, Aramco will acquire 50% of Royal Dutch Shell's stake in their refiner in Saudi Arabia for US$631 million.[98]\n\n\n\n#### List of refineries[edit]\n\n\nList of domestic refineries:[97]\n\n\n\n* Jazan Refinery and terminal projects (JRTP) (400,000 bbl/d (64,000 m3/d)), Jazan construction is ongoing.[99]\n* Jeddah Refinery (78,000 bbl/d (12,400 m3/d)) Jeddah converted to product storage terminal in November 2017.\n* Ras Tanura Refinery (550,000 bbl/d (87,000 m3/d)) (includes a Crude Distillation Unit, a Gas Condensate Unit, a hydrocracker, and catalytic reforming)\n* The Saudi Aramco Jubail Refinery Co.

It used to have its own created subsidiary company, Vela International Marine, which was merged with Bahri company, to handle shipping to North America, Europe, and Asia.[107] It is a stakeholder in the King Salman Global Maritime Industries Complex, a shipyard that will be the largest in the world when complete.[108]\n\n\n\n### Global investment[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco expanded its presence worldwide to include the three major global energy markets of Asia, Europe, and North America.[109] In April 2019, Aramco has signed a deal to acquire a 13% stake in South Korean oil refiner Hyundai Oilbank for US$1.24 billion.[110][111] Moreover, on 11 April 2019, Aramco signed an agreement with Poland’s leading oil refiner PKN Orlen to supply it with Arabian Crude Oil.[112]\n\n\n\n### Liquefied natural gas[edit]\n\n\nAramco is planning to be a major producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the world.[113][114] It sold its first cargo of LNG from Singapore to an Indian buyer.[113] The company is looking globally for potential joint ventures and partnerships to achieve its goal regarding LNG market.[113][114]\n\n\n\n## Saudization[edit]\n\n\nThe original concession agreement included Article 23; as Ali Al-Naimi pointed out, this was a \"key building block in the shaping of Saudi society for decades to come.\" It reads, \"The enterprise under this contract shall be directed and supervised by Americans who shall employ Saudi nationals as far as practicable, and in so far as the company can find suitable Saudi employees it will not employ other nationals.\" The first company school was started in May 1940 in the Al-Khobar home of Hijji bin Jassim, company interpreter, translator and first instructor. Al-Naimi pointed out, \"From the beginning, the development of Aramco was directly tied to the betterment of Saudi Arabia.\" Another school was located in Dhahran in 1941, and was called the Jebel School. Boys hired into entry-level positions attended at 7 AM for four hours, followed by four hours of work in the afternoon. In 1950, Aramco built schools for 2,400 students. In 1959, Aramco sent the first group of Saudi students to college in the States. In 1970, Aramco started hiring its first high school graduates, and in 1979 started offering college scholarships. In 1965, Zafer H. Husseini was named the first Saudi manager and in 1974, Faisal Al-Bassam was named the first Saudi vice president. One of the early students was Al-Naimi, who was named the first Saudi president of Aramco in November 1983. As Al-Naimi states, \"The oil company committed itself to developing qualified Saudis to become fully educated and trained industry professionals.\" Al-Naimi acknowledged Thomas Barger's championing of Saudization, \"You, of all of Aramco's leaders, had the greatest vision when you supported the training effort of Saudi Arab employees during its early days. That visionary support and effort is bearing fruit now and many executive positions are filled by Saudis because of that effort.\" In 1943, 1,600 Saudis were employed at Aramco, but by 1987, nearly two-thirds of Aramco's 43,500 strong workforce were Saudis. In 1988, Al-Naimi became CEO and Hisham Nazer became chairman, the first Saudis to hold those positions. The \"pinnacle of Saudization\" occurred when the Shaybah oil field came on line in July 1998, after a three-year effort by a team consisting of 90% Saudis. The Aramco of 2016 still maintained an expatriate workforce of about 15%, so Aramco can, in the words of Al-Naimi, \"be sure it is getting access to the latest innovations and technical expertise.\"[27]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco has emitted 59.26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent since it began operations, accounting for 4.38% of worldwide anthropogenic CO2 emissions since 1965.[115]\n\n\nIn a letter sent to nine international banks reportedly hired by Aramco to assist it in arranging its US$2 trillion market debut, ten environmental groups warned about the listing causing a highly possible hindrance in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and end human rights abuses committed by the Saudi regime.[116]\n\n\nOn 6 November 2019, Saudi Aramco joined the World Bank's initiative to reduce gas flaring to zero by 2030. The firm reported flaring of less than 1% of its total raw gas production in the first half of 2019.[117]\n\n\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions[edit]\n\n\nAccording to environmentalists Aramco is responsible for more than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions since 1965. Most of this is from the use of the oil they sold, for example burning gasoline in car engines. In greenhouse gas accounting such emissions from use of a product are called \"scope 3\" emissions. Aramco has no plan to limit scope 3 emissions. However the government says it will have net zero carbon emissions by 2060 within the country.[118] In October 2023, Saudi Aramco announced a direct air capture pilot program in partnership with Siemens Energy to be completed in 2024.[119]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### 2007 Haradh gas pipeline explosion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2007 Haradh, Saudi Arabia gas pipeline explosion\n\nOn 18 November 2007, reports came out that a natural gas pipeline explosion had taken the lives of several workers, the death toll was later determined to be 34.[120][121] Aramco asserts it was a purely maintenance-related incident.\n\n\n\n### Organizational culture[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2020, the Financial Times published an article about an engineer, whose family claims that Saudi Aramco was negligent in handling his Covid-19 infection.[122] According to his family, he had been asking the company and authorities for help, three weeks before his death, but was simply asked to keep his gloves and mask on. Saudi Aramco did not formally contact his family until approximately 14 hours after his death, refused to release his body, and allegedly erased information from his mobile phone. His grieving family had to do without financial support for almost five months, and only received $400,000 in benefits, back pay and insurance after the Financial Times had started asking questions.\n\n\nIn the same article, five whistleblowers accuse Aramco of bullying and mismanagement.[122] One former employee expressed his concerns about the company’s highly dangerous failure to pressure-test valves and mains units, detailing cracks in the refinery structure and sinking of roads and foundations. The refinery runs a real risk of becoming Aramco's Piper Alpha, said another expatriate employee, who also accuses Aramco of lacking a culture of challenge, facilitating ineptitude and laziness.\n\n\n\n### Treatment of workers[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Saudi Aramco came under fire after photos of a migrant worker dressed as a large hand-sanitizer dispenser went viral on social media.[123] People on Twitter condemned the act as \"modern-day slavery,\" \"humiliating\" and \"dehumanizing.\"[124] According to the company, the display was organized without the approval of Aramco officials.[124][125]\n\n\n\n### Strong-arming investors[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, sources told the Financial Times that wealthy families of Saudi Arabia had been coerced into joining the Saudi Aramco IPO.[126][127] According to analysts, Aramco could realistically reach a market capitalization of $1 to $1.5 trillion but the Saudis wanted $2 trillion. Oddly, many of those who signed up have relatives that were part of the 2017–2019 Saudi Arabian purge. According to four sources, the Saudi government \"strong-armed\", \"coerced\" or \"bullied\" some of the wealthiest families in the kingdom into becoming cornerstone investors.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Lobbying and research projects[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco has funded almost 500 studies in last five years on energy issues and collaborated with the United States Department of Energy on projects to boost oil production, such as developing more efficient gasoline, enhanced oil recovery and methods to increase the flow of oil from wells. Since 2016, Saudi Arabia has spent around $140 million on lobbying to influence public opinion and policies in the US. In an effort to keep gasoline cars competitive, Saudi Aramco is working on a device which would trap some of the carbon dioxide upon attaching it to cars running on gasoline. Saudi Aramco has partnered with Hyundai to develop a fuel for gas-electric vehicles which will run on petroleum.[128]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Saudi Arabia portal\n* ![icon](image)Energy portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Ghawar\n* Max Steineke\n* Shamoon\n* List of oil fields: All of those located in Saudi Arabia are owned by Saudi Aramco.\n* Abqaiq\n* Aramco Financial Services Company\n* Aramco Training Services Company\n* Golden gimmick\n* Thomas Barger\n* *Discovery!

It was created through a restructuring of Google on October 2, 2015,[2] and became the parent company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries.[3][4][5] Alphabet is the world's third-largest technology company by revenue and one of the world's most valuable companies.[6][7] It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\n\nThe establishment of Alphabet Inc. was prompted by a desire to make the core Google business \"cleaner and more accountable\" while allowing greater autonomy to group companies that operate in businesses other than Internet services.[4][8] Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin announced their resignation from their executive posts in December 2019, with the CEO role to be filled by Sundar Pichai, also the CEO of Google. Page and Brin remain employees, board members, and controlling shareholders of Alphabet Inc.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nOn August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to create a new public holding company, Alphabet Inc. Google co-founder and CEO Larry Page made this announcement in a blog post on Google's official blog.[10] Alphabet was created to restructure Google by moving subsidiaries from Google to Alphabet, thus narrowing Google's scope. The new holding company would consist of Google as well as other businesses including X Development, Calico, Nest, Verily, Fiber, Makani, CapitalG, and GV.[11][12][13] Sundar Pichai, the company's Product Chief, became the new chief executive officer of Google, replacing Page, who transitioned to the role of running Alphabet, along with co-founder Sergey Brin.[14][15]\n\n\nIn his announcement, Page stated that the planned holding company would allow for \"more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren't very related\" to Google. He clarified that, as a result of the new holding company, Google would be \"a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead\".[16] He further stated that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google \"cleaner and more accountable and better\" and that that he wanted to improve \"the transparency and oversight of what we're doing\".[4][8]\n\n\nFormer executive Eric Schmidt (now Technical Advisor) revealed in the conference in 2017 the inspiration for this structure came from Warren Buffett and his management structure of Berkshire Hathaway a decade ago.[17] Schmidt said he encouraged Page and Brin to meet with Buffett in Omaha to see how Berkshire Hathaway was a holding company made of subsidiaries with strong CEOs who were trusted to run their businesses.[17]\n\n\nBefore it became a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google Inc. was first structured as the owner of Alphabet. The roles were reversed after a placeholder subsidiary was created for the ownership of Alphabet, at which point the newly formed subsidiary was merged with Google. Google's stock was then converted to Alphabet's stock. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (where Alphabet is incorporated), a holding company reorganization such as this can be done without a vote of shareholders, as this reorganization was.[18] The restructuring process was completed on October 2, 2015.[2] Alphabet retains Google Inc.'s stock price history and continues to trade under Google Inc.'s former ticker symbols \"GOOG\" and \"GOOGL\"; both classes of stock are components of major stock market indices such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100.[19]\n\n\nOn December 3, 2019, Page and Brin jointly announced that they would step down from their respective roles, remaining as employees and still the majority vote on the board of directors. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, assumed the CEO role at Alphabet while retaining the same at Google.[20]\n\n\nThe firm completed a stock split in mid-2022.[21]\n\n\nOn January 20, 2023, Pichai wrote a letter to all employees announcing that the company would be laying off about 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its global workforce. In the letter, Pichai wrote, \"Over the past two years we’ve seen periods of dramatic growth. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today.\"[22]\n\n\n\n## Structure[edit]\n\n\nAlphabet Inc. is the parent of a diverse set of subsidiaries:[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Subsidiary\n | Business\n | Executive Leader\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Calico | Human health (by overcoming aging)\n | Arthur D. Levinson |\n| CapitalG | Private equity for growth stage technology companies\n | David Lawee |\n| Google | Internet services, largest subsidiary and prior corporate entity name\n | Sundar Pichai |\n| Google Fiber | Internet access: via fiber\n | Dinesh Jain\n |\n| GV | Venture capital for technology companies\n | David Krane |\n| Intrinsic | Robotics software\n | Wendy Tan White[26] |\n| Isomorphic Labs | Drug discovery | Demis Hassabis\n |\n| Mineral\n | Sustainable agriculture | Elliott Grant[27] |\n| Verily | Human health\n | Andrew Conrad |\n| Waymo | Autonomous driving\n | Dmitri Dolgov\nTekedra Mawakana\n |\n| Wing | Drone-based delivery of freight\n | James Ryan Burgess\n |\n| X Development | Research and development for \"moonshot\" technologies\n | Astro Teller |\n\n\nAs of September 1, 2017[update], their equity is held by a subsidiary known as **XXVI Holdings, Inc.** (referring to the Roman numeral of 26, the number of letters in the alphabet), so that they can be valued and legally separated from Google. At the same time, it was announced that Google would be reorganized as a limited liability company, Google LLC.[28][29]\n\n\nEric Schmidt said at an Internet Association event in 2015 that there may eventually be more than 26 Alphabet subsidiaries. He also said that he was currently meeting with the CEOs of the current and proposed Alphabet subsidiaries. He said, \"You'll see a lot coming.\"[30]\n\n\nWhile many companies or divisions formerly a part of Google became subsidiaries of Alphabet, Google remains the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet-related businesses. These include widely used products and services long associated with Google, such as the Android mobile operating system, YouTube, and Google Search, which remain direct components of Google.[11][31]\n\n\nFormer subsidiaries include Nest Labs, which was merged into Google in February 2018[32] and Chronicle which was merged with Google Cloud in June 2019.[33] Sidewalk Labs was absorbed into Google in 2021 following CEO Daniel L. Doctoroff's departure from the company due to a suspected ALS diagnosis.[34]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Loon LLC CEO Alastair Westgarth mentioned in a blog post[35] that the company would be shutting down, citing lack of a scalable and sustainable business model. In July 2021, Alphabet announced Intrinsic, a new robotics software company spun out of X.[36] In November 2021, Alphabet announced a new company named Isomorphic Labs, using artificial intelligence for drug discovery and headed by DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis.[37]\n\n\n\n## Senior leadership[edit]\n\n\n* *Chair:* John L. Hennessy (since February 2018)\n* *Chief Executive:* Sundar Pichai (since December 2019)\n* *Chief Financial Officer:* Ruth Porat\n* *Chief Accounting Officer:* Amie Thuener O'Toole\n\n\n**Source:**[38]\n\n\n\n### List of former board chairs[edit]\n\n\n1. Eric Schmidt (2015–2017)\n\n\n### List of former chief executives[edit]\n\n\n1. Larry Page (2015–2018)\n\n\n## Corporate identity[edit]\n\n\nPage explained the origin of the company's name:[16]\n\n\n\n\n> We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha‑bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!\n> \n> \n\n\nIn a 2018 talk, Schmidt disclosed that the original inspiration for the name came from the location of the then Google Hamburg office's street address: ABC-Straße.[39]\n\n\nAlphabet has chosen the domain abc.xyz with the .xyz top-level domain (TLD), which was introduced in 2014. It does not own the domain alphabet.com, which is owned by a fleet management division of BMW. Following the announcement, BMW said it would be \"necessary to examine the legal trademark implications\" of the proposals. Additionally, it does not own the domain abc.com, which is the domain of the Disney-owned American Broadcasting Company.[40][41]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal (and calendar) year 2021, Alphabet reported a net income of $76.033 billion. The annual revenue was $257.6 billion, an increase of 41% over the previous fiscal year.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenue(mil. USD)\n | Net income(mil. USD)\n | Total assets(mil. USD)\n | Employees\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016[42] | 90,272\n | 19,478\n | 167,497\n | 72,053\n |\n| 2017[43] | 110,855\n | 12,662\n | 197,295\n | 80,110\n |\n| 2018[44] | 136,819\n | 30,736\n | 232,792\n | 98,771\n |\n| 2019[45] | 161,857\n | 34,343\n | 275,909\n | 118,899\n |\n| 2020[46] | 182,527\n | 40,269\n | 319,616\n | 135,301\n |\n| 2021[47] | 257,637\n | 76,033\n | 359,268\n | 156,500\n |\n| 2022[1] | 282,836\n | 59,972\n | 365,264\n | 190,234\n |\n\n\nAs per its 2017 annual report, 86% of Alphabet's revenues came from performance advertising (through user clicks using AdSense and Google Ads) and brand advertising.[48] Of these, 53% came from its international operations. This translated to a total revenue of US$110,855 million in 2017 and a net income of US$12,662 million.\n\n\nOn February 1, 2016, Alphabet Inc. surpassed Apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company until February 3, 2016, when Apple surged back over Alphabet to retake the position. Experts cited Apple's lack of innovation as well as increasing Chinese competition as reasons for the poor performance.[49][50]\n\n\nAs of 2019[update], Alphabet is ranked No. 15 on the *Fortune* 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[51]\n\n\nOn January 16, 2020, Alphabet became the fourth US company to reach a $1 trillion market value[52] entering the trillion dollar companies club for the first time.\n\n\nIn October 2022, Alphabet recorded the weakest quarterly growth, with fewer sales in nearly a decade. The possible global recession, the strong US dollar, and the pandemics all contributed to the slowed economy.[53]\n\n\n\n## Investments and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\n### Investments[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Alphabet Inc. led a Series A round of $71 million along with Andreessen Horowitz and 20th Century Fox in music startup UnitedMasters, founded by Steve Stoute.[54]\n\n\nIn addition to funding startups, Alphabet also invests in more mature companies, including publicly traded companies like Uber and privately held companies like Medium.[55]\n\n\n\n### Acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet\n\nAn analysis of the company's investments in 2017 suggested that it was the most active investor in that period, outdoing the capital arm of Intel and also its own best customer. Alphabet, Inc. acquired seven of its own capital-backed startups in the 2017 financial year, with Cisco second having acquired six of the company's previous investments.[56]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits and controversies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Google, Google litigation, European Union vs. Google, Censorship by Google, and Privacy concerns regarding Google\n\nIn 2017, Alphabet Inc. sued Uber over technology similar to Alphabet's proprietary self-driving car technology. Alphabet's autonomous vehicle technology had been under development for a decade by Alphabet's Waymo (self-driving vehicle division). The proprietary technology is related to 14,000 documents believed to have been downloaded and stolen by a former Waymo engineer, subsequently employed by Uber.[57][58] The lawsuit was settled in February 2018, with Uber agreeing not to use the self-driving technology in dispute and also agreed to provide Waymo with an equity stake of 0.34%, equating to around $245 million at the firm's early 2018 value.[59]\n\n\nIn October 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Google and Alphabet due to \"non-public\" Google+ account data being exposed as a result of a privacy bug that allowed app developers to gain access to the private information of users. The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million with a payout to claimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12 each.[60][61][62]\n\n\nIn October 2020, the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet, alleging anti-competitive practices.[63]\n\n\nOn 2 December 2020, the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint that claimed Alphabet Inc conducted unlawful monitoring and questioning of several workers at Google. The employees in question were fired for unionization attempts and protesting company policies. The board also alleges that Google unlawfully placed employees on administrative leave in retribution. Alphabet Inc has denied any wrongdoing and said it acted legally.[64]\n\n\nOn 7 June 2021, Alphabet Inc., parent company to Google, announced it had settled an antitrust suit with the French *Autorité de la concurrence* with a payment of $270 million. The settlement amounted to less than 0.7% of Alphabet Inc.'s yearly earnings.[65]\n\n\nOn 12 June 2021, it was announced that Japan would launch an antitrust probe into Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. to determine whether their dealings with Japanese smartphone makers violate current antitrust measures or could necessitate new ones.[66]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Russian authorities seized Google's Russian bank account,[67] forcing them to file for bankruptcy one month late due to the inability to pay vendors and staff. However, free services such as Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Android and Play were to remain available.[68]\n\n\nIn 2023, the company was criticized for conducting mass lay-offs without informing employees before they arrived to work, including many long-tenured and recently promoted employees. According to various posts on social media, several Google employees discovered they had been terminated after they were unable to access their accounts and confirming it through news articles discussing the mass layoffs.[69][70][71]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Google LLC\n* ![](image) San Francisco Bay Area portal\n* ![icon](image) Internet portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Alphabet Inc. 2022 Annual Form 10-K Report\".

It was created through a restructuring of Google on October 2, 2015,[2] and became the parent company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries.[3][4][5] Alphabet is the world's third-largest technology company by revenue and one of the world's most valuable companies.[6][7] It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\n\nThe establishment of Alphabet Inc. was prompted by a desire to make the core Google business \"cleaner and more accountable\" while allowing greater autonomy to group companies that operate in businesses other than Internet services.[4][8] Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin announced their resignation from their executive posts in December 2019, with the CEO role to be filled by Sundar Pichai, also the CEO of Google. Page and Brin remain employees, board members, and controlling shareholders of Alphabet Inc.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nOn August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to create a new public holding company, Alphabet Inc. Google co-founder and CEO Larry Page made this announcement in a blog post on Google's official blog.[10] Alphabet was created to restructure Google by moving subsidiaries from Google to Alphabet, thus narrowing Google's scope. The new holding company would consist of Google as well as other businesses including X Development, Calico, Nest, Verily, Fiber, Makani, CapitalG, and GV.[11][12][13] Sundar Pichai, the company's Product Chief, became the new chief executive officer of Google, replacing Page, who transitioned to the role of running Alphabet, along with co-founder Sergey Brin.[14][15]\n\n\nIn his announcement, Page stated that the planned holding company would allow for \"more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren't very related\" to Google. He clarified that, as a result of the new holding company, Google would be \"a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead\".[16] He further stated that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google \"cleaner and more accountable and better\" and that that he wanted to improve \"the transparency and oversight of what we're doing\".[4][8]\n\n\nFormer executive Eric Schmidt (now Technical Advisor) revealed in the conference in 2017 the inspiration for this structure came from Warren Buffett and his management structure of Berkshire Hathaway a decade ago.[17] Schmidt said he encouraged Page and Brin to meet with Buffett in Omaha to see how Berkshire Hathaway was a holding company made of subsidiaries with strong CEOs who were trusted to run their businesses.[17]\n\n\nBefore it became a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google Inc. was first structured as the owner of Alphabet. The roles were reversed after a placeholder subsidiary was created for the ownership of Alphabet, at which point the newly formed subsidiary was merged with Google. Google's stock was then converted to Alphabet's stock. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (where Alphabet is incorporated), a holding company reorganization such as this can be done without a vote of shareholders, as this reorganization was.[18] The restructuring process was completed on October 2, 2015.[2] Alphabet retains Google Inc.'s stock price history and continues to trade under Google Inc.'s former ticker symbols \"GOOG\" and \"GOOGL\"; both classes of stock are components of major stock market indices such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100.[19]\n\n\nOn December 3, 2019, Page and Brin jointly announced that they would step down from their respective roles, remaining as employees and still the majority vote on the board of directors. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, assumed the CEO role at Alphabet while retaining the same at Google.[20]\n\n\nThe firm completed a stock split in mid-2022.[21]\n\n\nOn January 20, 2023, Pichai wrote a letter to all employees announcing that the company would be laying off about 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its global workforce. In the letter, Pichai wrote, \"Over the past two years we’ve seen periods of dramatic growth. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today.\"[22]\n\n\n\n## Structure[edit]\n\n\nAlphabet Inc. is the parent of a diverse set of subsidiaries:[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Subsidiary\n | Business\n | Executive Leader\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Calico | Human health (by overcoming aging)\n | Arthur D. Levinson |\n| CapitalG | Private equity for growth stage technology companies\n | David Lawee |\n| Google | Internet services, largest subsidiary and prior corporate entity name\n | Sundar Pichai |\n| Google Fiber | Internet access: via fiber\n | Dinesh Jain\n |\n| GV | Venture capital for technology companies\n | David Krane |\n| Intrinsic | Robotics software\n | Wendy Tan White[26] |\n| Isomorphic Labs | Drug discovery | Demis Hassabis\n |\n| Mineral\n | Sustainable agriculture | Elliott Grant[27] |\n| Verily | Human health\n | Andrew Conrad |\n| Waymo | Autonomous driving\n | Dmitri Dolgov\nTekedra Mawakana\n |\n| Wing | Drone-based delivery of freight\n | James Ryan Burgess\n |\n| X Development | Research and development for \"moonshot\" technologies\n | Astro Teller |\n\n\nAs of September 1, 2017[update], their equity is held by a subsidiary known as **XXVI Holdings, Inc.** (referring to the Roman numeral of 26, the number of letters in the alphabet), so that they can be valued and legally separated from Google. At the same time, it was announced that Google would be reorganized as a limited liability company, Google LLC.[28][29]\n\n\nEric Schmidt said at an Internet Association event in 2015 that there may eventually be more than 26 Alphabet subsidiaries. He also said that he was currently meeting with the CEOs of the current and proposed Alphabet subsidiaries. He said, \"You'll see a lot coming.\"[30]\n\n\nWhile many companies or divisions formerly a part of Google became subsidiaries of Alphabet, Google remains the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet-related businesses. These include widely used products and services long associated with Google, such as the Android mobile operating system, YouTube, and Google Search, which remain direct components of Google.[11][31]\n\n\nFormer subsidiaries include Nest Labs, which was merged into Google in February 2018[32] and Chronicle which was merged with Google Cloud in June 2019.[33] Sidewalk Labs was absorbed into Google in 2021 following CEO Daniel L. Doctoroff's departure from the company due to a suspected ALS diagnosis.[34]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Loon LLC CEO Alastair Westgarth mentioned in a blog post[35] that the company would be shutting down, citing lack of a scalable and sustainable business model. In July 2021, Alphabet announced Intrinsic, a new robotics software company spun out of X.[36] In November 2021, Alphabet announced a new company named Isomorphic Labs, using artificial intelligence for drug discovery and headed by DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis.[37]\n\n\n\n## Senior leadership[edit]\n\n\n* *Chair:* John L. Hennessy (since February 2018)\n* *Chief Executive:* Sundar Pichai (since December 2019)\n* *Chief Financial Officer:* Ruth Porat\n* *Chief Accounting Officer:* Amie Thuener O'Toole\n\n\n**Source:**[38]\n\n\n\n### List of former board chairs[edit]\n\n\n1. Eric Schmidt (2015–2017)\n\n\n### List of former chief executives[edit]\n\n\n1. Larry Page (2015–2018)\n\n\n## Corporate identity[edit]\n\n\nPage explained the origin of the company's name:[16]\n\n\n\n\n> We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha‑bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!\n> \n> \n\n\nIn a 2018 talk, Schmidt disclosed that the original inspiration for the name came from the location of the then Google Hamburg office's street address: ABC-Straße.[39]\n\n\nAlphabet has chosen the domain abc.xyz with the .xyz top-level domain (TLD), which was introduced in 2014. It does not own the domain alphabet.com, which is owned by a fleet management division of BMW. Following the announcement, BMW said it would be \"necessary to examine the legal trademark implications\" of the proposals. Additionally, it does not own the domain abc.com, which is the domain of the Disney-owned American Broadcasting Company.[40][41]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal (and calendar) year 2021, Alphabet reported a net income of $76.033 billion. The annual revenue was $257.6 billion, an increase of 41% over the previous fiscal year.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenue(mil. USD)\n | Net income(mil. USD)\n | Total assets(mil. USD)\n | Employees\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016[42] | 90,272\n | 19,478\n | 167,497\n | 72,053\n |\n| 2017[43] | 110,855\n | 12,662\n | 197,295\n | 80,110\n |\n| 2018[44] | 136,819\n | 30,736\n | 232,792\n | 98,771\n |\n| 2019[45] | 161,857\n | 34,343\n | 275,909\n | 118,899\n |\n| 2020[46] | 182,527\n | 40,269\n | 319,616\n | 135,301\n |\n| 2021[47] | 257,637\n | 76,033\n | 359,268\n | 156,500\n |\n| 2022[1] | 282,836\n | 59,972\n | 365,264\n | 190,234\n |\n\n\nAs per its 2017 annual report, 86% of Alphabet's revenues came from performance advertising (through user clicks using AdSense and Google Ads) and brand advertising.[48] Of these, 53% came from its international operations. This translated to a total revenue of US$110,855 million in 2017 and a net income of US$12,662 million.\n\n\nOn February 1, 2016, Alphabet Inc. surpassed Apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company until February 3, 2016, when Apple surged back over Alphabet to retake the position. Experts cited Apple's lack of innovation as well as increasing Chinese competition as reasons for the poor performance.[49][50]\n\n\nAs of 2019[update], Alphabet is ranked No. 15 on the *Fortune* 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[51]\n\n\nOn January 16, 2020, Alphabet became the fourth US company to reach a $1 trillion market value[52] entering the trillion dollar companies club for the first time.\n\n\nIn October 2022, Alphabet recorded the weakest quarterly growth, with fewer sales in nearly a decade. The possible global recession, the strong US dollar, and the pandemics all contributed to the slowed economy.[53]\n\n\n\n## Investments and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\n### Investments[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Alphabet Inc. led a Series A round of $71 million along with Andreessen Horowitz and 20th Century Fox in music startup UnitedMasters, founded by Steve Stoute.[54]\n\n\nIn addition to funding startups, Alphabet also invests in more mature companies, including publicly traded companies like Uber and privately held companies like Medium.[55]\n\n\n\n### Acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet\n\nAn analysis of the company's investments in 2017 suggested that it was the most active investor in that period, outdoing the capital arm of Intel and also its own best customer. Alphabet, Inc. acquired seven of its own capital-backed startups in the 2017 financial year, with Cisco second having acquired six of the company's previous investments.[56]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits and controversies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Google, Google litigation, European Union vs. Google, Censorship by Google, and Privacy concerns regarding Google\n\nIn 2017, Alphabet Inc. sued Uber over technology similar to Alphabet's proprietary self-driving car technology. Alphabet's autonomous vehicle technology had been under development for a decade by Alphabet's Waymo (self-driving vehicle division). The proprietary technology is related to 14,000 documents believed to have been downloaded and stolen by a former Waymo engineer, subsequently employed by Uber.[57][58] The lawsuit was settled in February 2018, with Uber agreeing not to use the self-driving technology in dispute and also agreed to provide Waymo with an equity stake of 0.34%, equating to around $245 million at the firm's early 2018 value.[59]\n\n\nIn October 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Google and Alphabet due to \"non-public\" Google+ account data being exposed as a result of a privacy bug that allowed app developers to gain access to the private information of users. The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million with a payout to claimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12 each.[60][61][62]\n\n\nIn October 2020, the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet, alleging anti-competitive practices.[63]\n\n\nOn 2 December 2020, the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint that claimed Alphabet Inc conducted unlawful monitoring and questioning of several workers at Google. The employees in question were fired for unionization attempts and protesting company policies. The board also alleges that Google unlawfully placed employees on administrative leave in retribution. Alphabet Inc has denied any wrongdoing and said it acted legally.[64]\n\n\nOn 7 June 2021, Alphabet Inc., parent company to Google, announced it had settled an antitrust suit with the French *Autorité de la concurrence* with a payment of $270 million. The settlement amounted to less than 0.7% of Alphabet Inc.'s yearly earnings.[65]\n\n\nOn 12 June 2021, it was announced that Japan would launch an antitrust probe into Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. to determine whether their dealings with Japanese smartphone makers violate current antitrust measures or could necessitate new ones.[66]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Russian authorities seized Google's Russian bank account,[67] forcing them to file for bankruptcy one month late due to the inability to pay vendors and staff. However, free services such as Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Android and Play were to remain available.[68]\n\n\nIn 2023, the company was criticized for conducting mass lay-offs without informing employees before they arrived to work, including many long-tenured and recently promoted employees. According to various posts on social media, several Google employees discovered they had been terminated after they were unable to access their accounts and confirming it through news articles discussing the mass layoffs.[69][70][71]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Google LLC\n* ![](image) San Francisco Bay Area portal\n* ![icon](image) Internet portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Alphabet Inc. 2022 Annual Form 10-K Report\".

It has been often referred to as \"one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world\",[5] and is often regarded as one of the world's most valuable brands.[6] It is considered to be one of the Big Five American technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Apple, Meta and Microsoft.\n\n\nAmazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[7] on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories, a strategy that has earned it the moniker *The Everything Store*.[8] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[9]\n\n\nAmazon has earned a reputation as a disruptor of well-established industries through technological innovation and \"aggressive\" reinvestment of profits into capital expenditures.[10][11][12][13] As of 2023[update], it is the world's largest online retailer and marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service through AWS,[14] live-streaming service through Twitch, and Internet company as measured by revenue and market share.[15] In 2021, it surpassed Walmart as the world's largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has close to 200 million subscribers worldwide.[16][17] It is the second-largest private employer in the United States.[18]\n\n\nAmazon also distributes a variety of downloadable and streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video, MGM+, Amazon Music, Twitch, and Audible units. It publishes books through its publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, film and television content through Amazon MGM Studios, including the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio which acquired in March 2022. It also produces consumer electronics—most notably, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices, Fire tablets, and Fire TVs.\n\n\nAmazon has been criticized for customer data collection practices,[19] a toxic work culture,[20] tax avoidance,[21][22] and anti-competitive behavior.[23][24]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Amazon\n\n### 1994–2009: early years[edit]\n\n\nAmazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos, who chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent, as Microsoft was in the area.[25]\n\n\nAmazon went public in May 1997. It began selling music and videos in 1998, and began international operations by acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom and Germany. In the subsequent year, it initiated the sale of a diverse range of products, including music, video games, consumer electronics, home improvement items, software, games, and toys..[26][27]\n\n\nIn 2002, it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which initially focused on providing APIs for web developers to build web applications on top of Amazon's ecommerce platform.[28][29] In 2004, AWS was expanded to provide website popularity statistics and web crawler data from the Alexa Web Information Service.[30] AWS later shifted toward providing enterprise services with Simple Storage Service (S3) in 2006,[31] and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in 2008,[32] allowing companies to rent data storage and computing power from Amazon. In 2006, Amazon also launched the *Fulfillment by Amazon* program, which allowed individuals and small companies (called \"third-party sellers\") to sell products through Amazon's warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure.[33]\n\n\n\n### 2010–present: growth[edit]\n\n\nAmazon purchased the Whole Foods Market supermarket chain in 2017.[34] It is the leading e-retailer in the United States with approximately US$178 billion net sales in 2017. It has over 300 million active customer accounts globally.[35]\n\n\nAmazon saw large growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, hiring more than 100,000 staff in the United States and Canada.[36] Some Amazon workers in the US, France, and Italy protested the company's decision to \"run normal shifts\" due to COVID-19's ease of spread in warehouses.[37][38] In Spain, the company faced legal complaints over its policies,[39] while a group of US Senators wrote an open letter to Bezos expressing concerns about workplace safety.[40]\n\n\nOn February 2, 2021, Bezos announced that he would step down as CEO to become executive chair of Amazon's board. The transition officially took place on July 5, 2021, with former CEO of AWS Andy Jassy replacing him as CEO.[41][42] In January 2023, Amazon cut over 18,000 jobs, primarily in consumer retail and its human resources division in an attempt to cut costs.[43]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Amazon products and services\n\n### Amazon.com [edit]\n\n\n\n\namazon.com| ![](image)Logo since January 2000\n |\n| Screenshot\n![](image)Homepage\n |\n| Type of site\n | E-commerce |\n| Available in | * Arabic\n* Chinese\n* Dutch\n* English\n* French\n* German\n* Hindi\n* Italian\n* Japanese\n* Polish\n* Portuguese\n* Spanish\n* Swedish\n* Turkish\n |\n| Owner | Amazon |\n| URL | amazon.com (original US site) |\n| Commercial | Yes |\n| Registration | Optional |\n| Launched | 1995; 29 years ago (1995) |\n| Current status | Active |\n| Written in | C++ and Java |\n| [44] |\n\n\nAmazon.com is an e-commerce platform that sells many product lines, including media (books, movies, music, and software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and personal care products, industrial & scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry, watches, lawn and garden items, musical instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items, toys and games, and farm supplies[45] and consulting services.[46] Amazon websites are country-specific (for example, amazon.com for the US and amazon.fr for France), though some offer international shipping.[47]\n\n\nVisits to *amazon.com* grew from 615 million annual visitors in 2008,[48] to more than 2 billion per month in 2022.[49] The e-commerce platform is the 14th most visited website in the world.[50]\n\n\nResults generated by Amazon's search engine are partly determined by promotional fees.[51] The company's localized storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by top-level domain and country code:\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n| Region | Country | Domain name | Since | Languages\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Africa\n | Egypt | amazon.eg | September 2021 | Arabic, English\n | Formerly known as Souq.com Egypt\n |\n| Americas\n | Brazil | amazon.com.br | December 2012 | Portuguese\n |  |\n| Canada | amazon.ca | June 2002 | English, French\n |  |\n| Mexico | amazon.com.mx | August 2013 | Spanish\n |  |\n| United States | amazon.com | July 1995 | English, Spanish, Arabic, German, Hebrew, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional)\n | International customers without a localized Amazon website may purchase eBooks from the Kindle Store on Amazon US.[52] |\n| Asia\n | China | amazon.cn | September 2004 | Chinese (Simplified)\n | Formerly known as Joyo.com CHN\n |\n| India | amazon.in | June 2013 | English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi\n |  |\n| Japan | amazon.co.jp | November 2000 | Japanese, English, Chinese (Simplified)\n |  |\n| Saudi Arabia | amazon.sa | June 2020 | Arabic, English\n | Formerly known as Souq.com KSA\n |\n| Singapore | amazon.sg | July 2017 | English\n |  |\n| Turkey | amazon.com.tr | September 2018 | Turkish\n |  |\n| United Arab Emirates | amazon.ae | May 2019 | Arabic, English\n | Formerly known as Souq.com UAE\n |\n| Europe\n | Belgium | amazon.com.be | October 2022 | Dutch, French, English\n |  |\n| France | amazon.fr | August 2000 | French\n |  |\n| Germany | amazon.de | October 1998 | German, English, Czech, Dutch, Polish, Turkish\n | Also serves Austria,[53] Denmark[54] and Switzerland[55] |\n| Italy | amazon.it | November 2010 | Italian\n |  |\n| Netherlands | amazon.nl | November 2014 | Dutch, English\n | Initially only books & e-books, full shop opened March 2020[56] |\n| Poland | amazon.pl | March 2021 | Polish\n |  |\n| Spain | amazon.es | September 2011 | Spanish, Portuguese\n | Also serves Portugal[57] |\n| Sweden | amazon.se | October 2020 | Swedish, English\n |  |\n| United Kingdom | amazon.co.uk | October 1998 | English\n | Also serves Ireland[58] |\n| Oceania | Australia | amazon.com.au | November 2017 | English\n | Also serves New Zealand[59] |\n\n\n#### Merchant partnerships[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, US toy retailer Toys \"R\" Us entered into a 10-year agreement with Amazon, valued at $50 million per year plus a cut of sales, under which Toys \"R\" Us would be the exclusive supplier of toys and baby products on the service, and the chain's website would redirect to Amazon's Toys & Games category. In 2004, Toys \"R\" Us sued Amazon, claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys \"R\" Us stock, Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys \"R\" Us had been granted exclusivity. In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys \"R\" Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its independent e-commerce website. The company was later awarded $51 million in damages.[60][61][62]\n\n\nIn 2001, Amazon entered into a similar agreement with Borders Group, under which Amazon would comanage Borders.com as a co-branded service.[63] Borders pulled out of the arrangement in 2007, with plans to also launch its own online store.[64]\n\n\nOn October 18, 2011, Amazon.com announced a partnership with DC Comics for the exclusive digital rights to many popular comics, including *Superman*, *Batman*, *Green Lantern*, *The Sandman*, and *Watchmen*. The partnership has caused well-known bookstores like Barnes & Noble to remove these titles from their shelves.[65]\n\n\nIn November 2013, Amazon announced a partnership with the United States Postal Service to begin delivering orders on Sundays. The service, included in Amazon's standard shipping rates, initiated in metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and New York because of the high-volume and inability to deliver in a timely way, with plans to expand into Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix by 2014.[66]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Nike agreed to sell products through Amazon in exchange for better policing of counterfeit goods.[67][68] This proved unsuccessful and Nike withdrew from the partnership in November 2019.[68][69] Companies including IKEA and Birkenstock also stopped selling through Amazon around the same time, citing similar frustrations over business practices and counterfeit goods.[70]\n\n\nIn September 2017, Amazon ventured with one of its sellers JV Appario Retail owned by Patni Group which has recorded a total income of US$ 104.44 million (₹759  crore) in financial year 2017–2018.[71]\n\n\nAs of October 11, 2017[update], AmazonFresh sold a range of Booths branded products for home delivery in selected areas.[72]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Amazon reached an agreement with Apple Inc. to sell selected products through the service, via the company and selected Apple Authorized Resellers. As a result of this partnership, only Apple Authorized Resellers may sell Apple products on Amazon effective January 4, 2019.[73][74]\n\n\n\n#### Private-label products[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Amazon brands\n\nAmazon sells many products under its own brand names, including phone chargers, batteries, and diaper wipes. The AmazonBasics brand was introduced in 2009, and now features hundreds of product lines, including smartphone cases, computer mice, batteries, dumbbells, and dog crates. Amazon owned 34 private-label brands as of 2019. These brands account for 0.15% of Amazon's global sales, whereas the average for other large retailers is 18%.[75] Other Amazon retail brands include Presto!, Mama Bear, and Amazon Essentials.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Third-party sellers[edit]\n\n\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon.[77] Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Affiliate program[edit]\n\n\nPublishers can signup as affiliates and receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has \"over 900,000 members\" in its affiliate programs.[79] In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads.[80] It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them a commission.[81]\n\n\nAssociates can access the Amazon catalog directly on their websites by using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) XML service. A new affiliate product, aStore, allows Associates to embed a subset of Amazon products within another website, or linked to another website. In June 2010, Amazon Seller Product Suggestions was launched to provide more transparency to sellers by recommending specific products to third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. Products suggested are based on customers' browsing history.[82]\n\n\n\n#### Product reviews[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Amazon § Amazon reviews\n\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. As of December 16, 2020, Amazon removed the ability of sellers and customers to comment on product reviews and purged their websites of all posted product review comments. In an email to sellers Amazon gave its rationale for removing this feature: \"... *the comments feature on customer reviews was rarely used*.\" The remaining review response options are to indicate whether the reader finds the review helpful or to report that it violates Amazon policies (abuse). If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.[83]\n\n\nWhen publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was \"taking a different approach ... we want to make every book available—the good, the bad and the ugly ... to let truth loose\".[84]\n\n\nThere have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by public relations companies on behalf of their clients[85] and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals' works.\n\n\n\n#### Amazon sales rank[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.[86] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.[86] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.[87] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors.[88] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,[89] though Amazon states:\n\n\n\n\n> Please keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers—we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources\n> \n> — Amazon.com Help[90]\n> \n\n\n### Physical stores[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in University Village in Seattle. The store is 5,500 square feet and prices for all products match those on its website.[91] Amazon opened its tenth physical book store in 2017;[92] media speculation suggests that Amazon plans to eventually roll out 300 to 400 bookstores around the country.[91]\n\n\nIn June 2018, it was reported that Amazon planned to open brick and mortar bookstores in Germany.[93]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Amazon applied to have a liquor store in San Francisco, CA, as a means to ship beer and alcohol within the city.[94]\n\n\nIn 2020, Amazon Fresh opened several physical stores in the US and the United Kingdom.[95]\n\n\n\n### Hardware and services[edit]\n\n\nAmazon has a number of products and services available, including its digital assistant Alexa, Amazon Music and Prime Video for music and videos respectively, the Amazon Appstore for Android apps, the Kindle line of eink e-readers, Fire and Fire HD color LCD tablets. Audible provides audiobooks for purchase and listening.\n\n\nIn September 2021, Amazon announced the launch of Astro, its first household robot, powered by its Alexa smart home technology. This can be remote-controlled when not at home, to check on pets, people, or home security. It will send owners a notification if it detects something unusual.[96]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Amazon announced the launch of RXPass, a prescription drug delivery service. It allows US Amazon Prime members to pay a $5 monthly fee for access to 60 medications. The service was launched immediately after the announcement except in states with specific prescription delivery requirements. Beneficiaries of government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will not be able to sign up for RXPass.[97]\n\n\n\n### Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Amazon\n\nAmazon owns over 100 subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, Audible, Diapers.com, Goodreads, IMDb, Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics), Shopbop, Teachstreet, Twitch, Zappos, and Zoox.[98]\n\n\n\n#### Amazon Web Services[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon Web Services\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide distributed computing processing capacity and software tools via AWS server farms.

Twitch was acquired by Amazon in August 2014 for $970 million.[104] The site's rapid growth had been boosted primarily by the prominence of major esports competitions on the service, leading GameSpot senior esports editor Rod Breslau to have described the service as \"the ESPN of esports\".[105] As of 2015[update], the service had over 1.5 million broadcasters and 100 million monthly viewers.[106]\n\n\n\n#### Whole Foods Market[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Whole Foods Market store in Ann Arbor, Michigan\nWhole Foods Market is an American supermarket chain exclusively featuring foods without artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats.[107] Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August 2017.[108][109][9]\n\n\n\n#### Other[edit]\n\n\nOther Amazon subsidiaries include:\n\n\n\n* **A9.com**, a company focused on researching and building innovative technology; it has been a subsidiary since 2003.[110]\n* **Amazon Maritime**, Inc. holds a Federal Maritime Commission license to operate as a non-vessel-owning common carrier (NVOCC), which enables the company to manage its shipments from China into the United States.[111]\n* **Amazon Pharmacy** is an online delivery service dedicated to prescription drugs, launched in November 2020.

The products can be purchased on the company's website or at over 50,000 bricks-and-mortar pharmacies in the United States.[112]\n* **Annapurna Labs**, an Israel-based microelectronics company reputedly for US$350–370M acquired by Amazon Web Services in January 2015 .[113][114][115]\n* **Beijing Century Joyo Courier Services**, which applied for a freight forwarding license with the US Maritime Commission. Amazon is also building out its logistics in trucking and air freight to potentially compete with UPS and FedEx.[116][117]\n* **Brilliance Audio**, an audiobook publisher founded in 1984 by Michael Snodgrass in Grand Haven, Michigan.[118] The company produced its first eight audio titles in 1985.[118] The company was purchased by Amazon in 2007 for an undisclosed amount.[119][120] At the time of the acquisition, Brilliance was producing 12–15 new titles a month.[120] It operates as an independent company within Amazon. In 1984, Brilliance Audio invented a technique for recording twice as much on the same cassette.[121] The technique involved recording on each of the two channels of each stereo track.[121] It has been credited with revolutionizing the burgeoning audiobook market in the mid-1980s since it made unabridged books affordable.[121]\n* **ComiXology**, a cloud-based digital comics platform with over 200 million comic downloads as of September 2013[update]. It offers a selection of more than 40,000 comic books and graphic novels across Android, iOS, Fire OS and Windows 8 devices and over a web browser.

This follows the 2018 purchase of PillPack for under $1 billion, which has also been included into Amazon Care.[128]\n* **Junglee**, a former online shopping service provided by Amazon that enabled customers to search for products from online and offline retailers in India. Junglee started as a virtual database that was used to extract information from the Internet and deliver it to enterprise applications. As it progressed, Junglee started to use its database technology to create a single window marketplace on the Internet by making every item from every supplier available for purchase. Web shoppers could locate, compare and transact millions of products from across the Internet shopping mall through one window.[129] Amazon acquired Junglee in 1998, and the website Junglee.com was launched in India in February 2012[130] as a comparison-shopping website. It curated and enabled searching for a diverse variety of products such as clothing, electronics, toys, jewelry, and video games, among others, across thousands of online and offline sellers. Millions of products are browsable, the client selects a price, and then they are directed to a seller. In November 2017, Amazon closed down Junglee.com and the former domain currently redirects to Amazon India.[131]\n* **Kuiper Systems**, a subsidiary of Amazon, set up to deploy a broadband satellite internet constellation with an announced 3,236 Low Earth orbit satellites to provide satellite based Internet connectivity.[132][133][134]\n* **Lab126**, developers of integrated consumer electronics such as the Kindle, became a subsidiary in 2004.[135]\n* **Shelfari**, a former social cataloging website for books.

Amazon bought the company in August 2008.[102] Shelfari continued to function as an independent book social network within the Amazon until January 2016, when Amazon announced that it would be merging Shelfari with Goodreads and closing down Shelfari.[136][137]\n* **Souq**, the former largest e-commerce platform in the Arab world. The company launched in 2005 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and served multiple areas across the Middle East.[138] On March 28, 2017, Amazon acquired Souq.com for $580 million.[139] The company was re-branded as Amazon and its infrastructure was used to expand Amazon's online platform in the Middle East.[140]\n\n\nAmazon also has investments in renewable energy and plans to expand its position into the Canadian market through an investment in a new plant in Alberta.[141]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Amazon locations\n\n### Logistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon Transportation Services truck at an Amazon Logistics delivery station\nAmazon uses many different transportation services to deliver packages. Amazon-branded services include:\n\n\n\n* Amazon Air, a cargo airline for bulk transport, with last-mile delivery handled either by Amazon Flex, Amazon Logistics, or the US Postal Service.\n\n\n![](image)Amazon delivery station in La Crosse by the La Crosse airport\n* Amazon Flex, a smartphone app that enables individuals to act as independent contractors, delivering packages to customers from personal vehicles without uniforms. Deliveries include one or two hours Prime Now, same or next day Amazon Fresh groceries, and standard Amazon.com orders, in addition to orders from local stores that contract with Amazon.[142]\n* Amazon Logistics, in which Amazon contracts with small businesses (which it calls \"Delivery Service Partners\") to perform deliveries to customers. Each business has a fleet of approximately 20–40 Amazon-branded vans, and employees of the contractors wear Amazon uniforms. As of December 2020, it operates in the United States, Canada, Italy, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom.[143]\n* Amazon Prime Air is an experimental drone delivery service that delivers packages via drones to Amazon Prime subscribers in select cities.\n\n\nAmazon directly employs people to work at its warehouses, bulk distribution centers, staffed \"Amazon Hub Locker+\" locations, and delivery stations where drivers pick up packages. As of December 2020, it is not hiring delivery drivers as employees.[144]\n\n\nRakuten Intelligence estimated that in 2020 in the United States, the proportion of last-mile deliveries was 56% by Amazon's directly contracted services (mostly in urban areas), 30% by the US Postal Service (mostly in rural areas), and 14% by UPS.[145] In April 2021, Amazon reported to investors it had increased its in-house delivery capacity by 50% in the last 12 months (which included the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States).[146]\n\n\n\n### Supply chain[edit]\n\n\nAmazon first launched its distribution network in 1997 with two fulfillment centers in Seattle and New Castle, Delaware. Amazon has several types of distribution facilities consisting of cross-dock centers, fulfillment centers, sortation centers, delivery stations, Prime now hubs, and Prime air hubs. There are 75 fulfillment centers and 25 sortation centers with over 125,000 employees.[147][148] Employees are responsible for five basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. Some warehouses are partially automated with systems built by Amazon Robotics.[149]\n\n\nIn September 2006, Amazon launched a program called FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) whereby it could handle storage, packing and distribution of products and services for small sellers.[33]\n\n\n\n* ![Amazon.fr fulfillment center in Lauwin-Planque, France](image)\n\nAmazon.fr fulfillment center in Lauwin-Planque, France\n* ![Amazon.es fulfillment center in San Fernando de Henares, Spain](image)\n\nAmazon.es fulfillment center in San Fernando de Henares, Spain\n* ![Amazon.co.uk fulfillment center in Glenrothes, Scotland, UK](image)\n\nAmazon.co.uk fulfillment center in Glenrothes, Scotland, UK\n* ![Amazon.de fulfillment center in Graben, Germany](image)\n\nAmazon.de fulfillment center in Graben, Germany\n* ![Amazon.co.jp fulfillment center in Ichikawa, Japan](image)\n\nAmazon.co.jp fulfillment center in Ichikawa, Japan\n* ![Amazon fulfillment center in Macon, Georgia, US](image)\n\nAmazon fulfillment center in Macon, Georgia, US\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2016\nAs of June 2022[update], Amazon's board of directors were:[150]\n\n\n\n* Jeff Bezos, executive chairman, Amazon.com, Inc.\n* Andy Jassy, president and CEO, Amazon.com, Inc.\n* Keith B.

Since 2007 sales increased from 14.835 billion to 469.822 billion, due to continued business expansion.[153]\n\n\nAmazon's market capitalization went over US$1 trillion again in early February 2020 after the announcement of the fourth quarter 2019 results.[154]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenue[155]in mil.

He also read many emails addressed by customers to his public email address.[174] One of Bezos's most well-known internal memos was his mandate for \"all teams\" to \"expose their data and functionality\" through service interfaces \"designed from the ground up to be externalizable\". This process, commonly known as a service-oriented architecture (SOA), resulted in mandatory dogfooding of services that would later be commercialized as part of AWS.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Lobbying[edit]\n\n\nAmazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property. According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve. Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5 million, $5 million and $9.5 million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.[175] In 2019, it spent $16.8 million and had a team of 104 lobbyists.[176]\n\n\nAmazon.com was a corporate member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) until it dropped membership following protests at its shareholders' meeting on May 24, 2012.[177]\n\n\nIn 2014, Amazon expanded its lobbying practices as it prepared to lobby the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its drone delivery program, hiring the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld lobbying firm in June.[178] Amazon and its lobbyists have visited with Federal Aviation Administration officials and aviation committees in Washington, D.C. to explain its plans to deliver packages.[179] In September 2020 this moved one step closer with the granting of a critical certificate by the FAA.[180]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Criticism of Amazon\n\n![](image)A sticker expressing an anti-Amazon message is pictured on the back of a street sign in Seattle.Amazon has attracted criticism for its actions, including: supplying law enforcement with facial recognition surveillance tools;[181] forming cloud computing partnerships with the CIA;[182] leading customers away from bookshops;[183] adversely impacting the environment;[184] placing a low priority on warehouse conditions for workers;[185] actively opposing unionization efforts;[186] remotely deleting content purchased by Amazon Kindle users; taking public subsidies; seeking to patent its 1-Click technology; engaging in anti-competitive actions and price discrimination;[23][24] and reclassifying LGBT books as adult content.[187][188] Criticism has also concerned various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the WikiLeaks website, works containing libel and material facilitating dogfight, cockfight, or pedophile activities. In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app. Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon.[189] Companies like Groupon, eBay and Taap.it countered Amazon's promotion by offering $10 off from their products.[190][191]\n\n\nThe company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone, \"that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\"[51] In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent.[192] In 2019, Amazon banned selling skin-lightening products after pushback from Minnesota health and environmental activists.[193] In 2022, a lawsuit filed by state attorney-general Letitia James was dismissed by the New York state court of appeals.[194]\n\n\nJane Friedman[195] discovered six listings of books fraudulently using her name, on Amazon and Goodreads. Amazon and Goodreads resisted removing the fraudulent titles until the author's complaints went viral on social media, in a blog post titled \"I Would Rather See My Books Get Pirated Than This (Or: Why Goodreads and Amazon Are Becoming Dumpster Fires).\"[196][197][198][199]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award\n* Amazon Pay\n* Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN)\n* Camelcamelcamel – a website that tracks the prices of products sold on Amazon.com\n* History of Amazon\n* Internal carbon pricing\n* List of book distributors\n* Statistically improbable phrases – Amazon.com's phrase extraction technique for indexing books\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Amazon.com, Inc. 2022 Form 10-K Annual Report\".

It has been often referred to as \"one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world\",[5] and is often regarded as one of the world's most valuable brands.[6] It is considered to be one of the Big Five American technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Apple, Meta and Microsoft.\n\n\nAmazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[7] on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories, a strategy that has earned it the moniker *The Everything Store*.[8] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[9]\n\n\nAmazon has earned a reputation as a disruptor of well-established industries through technological innovation and \"aggressive\" reinvestment of profits into capital expenditures.[10][11][12][13] As of 2023[update], it is the world's largest online retailer and marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service through AWS,[14] live-streaming service through Twitch, and Internet company as measured by revenue and market share.[15] In 2021, it surpassed Walmart as the world's largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has close to 200 million subscribers worldwide.[16][17] It is the second-largest private employer in the United States.[18]\n\n\nAmazon also distributes a variety of downloadable and streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video, MGM+, Amazon Music, Twitch, and Audible units. It publishes books through its publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, film and television content through Amazon MGM Studios, including the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio which acquired in March 2022. It also produces consumer electronics—most notably, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices, Fire tablets, and Fire TVs.\n\n\nAmazon has been criticized for customer data collection practices,[19] a toxic work culture,[20] tax avoidance,[21][22] and anti-competitive behavior.[23][24]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Amazon\n\n### 1994–2009: early years[edit]\n\n\nAmazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos, who chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent, as Microsoft was in the area.[25]\n\n\nAmazon went public in May 1997. It began selling music and videos in 1998, and began international operations by acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom and Germany. In the subsequent year, it initiated the sale of a diverse range of products, including music, video games, consumer electronics, home improvement items, software, games, and toys..[26][27]\n\n\nIn 2002, it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which initially focused on providing APIs for web developers to build web applications on top of Amazon's ecommerce platform.[28][29] In 2004, AWS was expanded to provide website popularity statistics and web crawler data from the Alexa Web Information Service.[30] AWS later shifted toward providing enterprise services with Simple Storage Service (S3) in 2006,[31] and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in 2008,[32] allowing companies to rent data storage and computing power from Amazon. In 2006, Amazon also launched the *Fulfillment by Amazon* program, which allowed individuals and small companies (called \"third-party sellers\") to sell products through Amazon's warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure.[33]\n\n\n\n### 2010–present: growth[edit]\n\n\nAmazon purchased the Whole Foods Market supermarket chain in 2017.[34] It is the leading e-retailer in the United States with approximately US$178 billion net sales in 2017. It has over 300 million active customer accounts globally.[35]\n\n\nAmazon saw large growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, hiring more than 100,000 staff in the United States and Canada.[36] Some Amazon workers in the US, France, and Italy protested the company's decision to \"run normal shifts\" due to COVID-19's ease of spread in warehouses.[37][38] In Spain, the company faced legal complaints over its policies,[39] while a group of US Senators wrote an open letter to Bezos expressing concerns about workplace safety.[40]\n\n\nOn February 2, 2021, Bezos announced that he would step down as CEO to become executive chair of Amazon's board. The transition officially took place on July 5, 2021, with former CEO of AWS Andy Jassy replacing him as CEO.[41][42] In January 2023, Amazon cut over 18,000 jobs, primarily in consumer retail and its human resources division in an attempt to cut costs.[43]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Amazon products and services\n\n### Amazon.com [edit]\n\n\n\n\namazon.com| ![](image)Logo since January 2000\n |\n| Screenshot\n![](image)Homepage\n |\n| Type of site\n | E-commerce |\n| Available in | * Arabic\n* Chinese\n* Dutch\n* English\n* French\n* German\n* Hindi\n* Italian\n* Japanese\n* Polish\n* Portuguese\n* Spanish\n* Swedish\n* Turkish\n |\n| Owner | Amazon |\n| URL | amazon.com (original US site) |\n| Commercial | Yes |\n| Registration | Optional |\n| Launched | 1995; 29 years ago (1995) |\n| Current status | Active |\n| Written in | C++ and Java |\n| [44] |\n\n\nAmazon.com is an e-commerce platform that sells many product lines, including media (books, movies, music, and software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and personal care products, industrial & scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry, watches, lawn and garden items, musical instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items, toys and games, and farm supplies[45] and consulting services.[46] Amazon websites are country-specific (for example, amazon.com for the US and amazon.fr for France), though some offer international shipping.[47]\n\n\nVisits to *amazon.com* grew from 615 million annual visitors in 2008,[48] to more than 2 billion per month in 2022.[49] The e-commerce platform is the 14th most visited website in the world.[50]\n\n\nResults generated by Amazon's search engine are partly determined by promotional fees.[51] The company's localized storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by top-level domain and country code:\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n| Region | Country | Domain name | Since | Languages\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Africa\n | Egypt | amazon.eg | September 2021 | Arabic, English\n | Formerly known as Souq.com Egypt\n |\n| Americas\n | Brazil | amazon.com.br | December 2012 | Portuguese\n |  |\n| Canada | amazon.ca | June 2002 | English, French\n |  |\n| Mexico | amazon.com.mx | August 2013 | Spanish\n |  |\n| United States | amazon.com | July 1995 | English, Spanish, Arabic, German, Hebrew, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional)\n | International customers without a localized Amazon website may purchase eBooks from the Kindle Store on Amazon US.[52] |\n| Asia\n | China | amazon.cn | September 2004 | Chinese (Simplified)\n | Formerly known as Joyo.com CHN\n |\n| India | amazon.in | June 2013 | English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi\n |  |\n| Japan | amazon.co.jp | November 2000 | Japanese, English, Chinese (Simplified)\n |  |\n| Saudi Arabia | amazon.sa | June 2020 | Arabic, English\n | Formerly known as Souq.com KSA\n |\n| Singapore | amazon.sg | July 2017 | English\n |  |\n| Turkey | amazon.com.tr | September 2018 | Turkish\n |  |\n| United Arab Emirates | amazon.ae | May 2019 | Arabic, English\n | Formerly known as Souq.com UAE\n |\n| Europe\n | Belgium | amazon.com.be | October 2022 | Dutch, French, English\n |  |\n| France | amazon.fr | August 2000 | French\n |  |\n| Germany | amazon.de | October 1998 | German, English, Czech, Dutch, Polish, Turkish\n | Also serves Austria,[53] Denmark[54] and Switzerland[55] |\n| Italy | amazon.it | November 2010 | Italian\n |  |\n| Netherlands | amazon.nl | November 2014 | Dutch, English\n | Initially only books & e-books, full shop opened March 2020[56] |\n| Poland | amazon.pl | March 2021 | Polish\n |  |\n| Spain | amazon.es | September 2011 | Spanish, Portuguese\n | Also serves Portugal[57] |\n| Sweden | amazon.se | October 2020 | Swedish, English\n |  |\n| United Kingdom | amazon.co.uk | October 1998 | English\n | Also serves Ireland[58] |\n| Oceania | Australia | amazon.com.au | November 2017 | English\n | Also serves New Zealand[59] |\n\n\n#### Merchant partnerships[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, US toy retailer Toys \"R\" Us entered into a 10-year agreement with Amazon, valued at $50 million per year plus a cut of sales, under which Toys \"R\" Us would be the exclusive supplier of toys and baby products on the service, and the chain's website would redirect to Amazon's Toys & Games category. In 2004, Toys \"R\" Us sued Amazon, claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys \"R\" Us stock, Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys \"R\" Us had been granted exclusivity. In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys \"R\" Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its independent e-commerce website. The company was later awarded $51 million in damages.[60][61][62]\n\n\nIn 2001, Amazon entered into a similar agreement with Borders Group, under which Amazon would comanage Borders.com as a co-branded service.[63] Borders pulled out of the arrangement in 2007, with plans to also launch its own online store.[64]\n\n\nOn October 18, 2011, Amazon.com announced a partnership with DC Comics for the exclusive digital rights to many popular comics, including *Superman*, *Batman*, *Green Lantern*, *The Sandman*, and *Watchmen*. The partnership has caused well-known bookstores like Barnes & Noble to remove these titles from their shelves.[65]\n\n\nIn November 2013, Amazon announced a partnership with the United States Postal Service to begin delivering orders on Sundays. The service, included in Amazon's standard shipping rates, initiated in metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and New York because of the high-volume and inability to deliver in a timely way, with plans to expand into Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix by 2014.[66]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Nike agreed to sell products through Amazon in exchange for better policing of counterfeit goods.[67][68] This proved unsuccessful and Nike withdrew from the partnership in November 2019.[68][69] Companies including IKEA and Birkenstock also stopped selling through Amazon around the same time, citing similar frustrations over business practices and counterfeit goods.[70]\n\n\nIn September 2017, Amazon ventured with one of its sellers JV Appario Retail owned by Patni Group which has recorded a total income of US$ 104.44 million (₹759  crore) in financial year 2017–2018.[71]\n\n\nAs of October 11, 2017[update], AmazonFresh sold a range of Booths branded products for home delivery in selected areas.[72]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Amazon reached an agreement with Apple Inc. to sell selected products through the service, via the company and selected Apple Authorized Resellers. As a result of this partnership, only Apple Authorized Resellers may sell Apple products on Amazon effective January 4, 2019.[73][74]\n\n\n\n#### Private-label products[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Amazon brands\n\nAmazon sells many products under its own brand names, including phone chargers, batteries, and diaper wipes. The AmazonBasics brand was introduced in 2009, and now features hundreds of product lines, including smartphone cases, computer mice, batteries, dumbbells, and dog crates. Amazon owned 34 private-label brands as of 2019. These brands account for 0.15% of Amazon's global sales, whereas the average for other large retailers is 18%.[75] Other Amazon retail brands include Presto!, Mama Bear, and Amazon Essentials.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Third-party sellers[edit]\n\n\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon.[77] Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Affiliate program[edit]\n\n\nPublishers can signup as affiliates and receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has \"over 900,000 members\" in its affiliate programs.[79] In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads.[80] It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them a commission.[81]\n\n\nAssociates can access the Amazon catalog directly on their websites by using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) XML service. A new affiliate product, aStore, allows Associates to embed a subset of Amazon products within another website, or linked to another website. In June 2010, Amazon Seller Product Suggestions was launched to provide more transparency to sellers by recommending specific products to third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. Products suggested are based on customers' browsing history.[82]\n\n\n\n#### Product reviews[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Amazon § Amazon reviews\n\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. As of December 16, 2020, Amazon removed the ability of sellers and customers to comment on product reviews and purged their websites of all posted product review comments. In an email to sellers Amazon gave its rationale for removing this feature: \"... *the comments feature on customer reviews was rarely used*.\" The remaining review response options are to indicate whether the reader finds the review helpful or to report that it violates Amazon policies (abuse). If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.[83]\n\n\nWhen publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was \"taking a different approach ... we want to make every book available—the good, the bad and the ugly ... to let truth loose\".[84]\n\n\nThere have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by public relations companies on behalf of their clients[85] and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals' works.\n\n\n\n#### Amazon sales rank[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.[86] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.[86] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.[87] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors.[88] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,[89] though Amazon states:\n\n\n\n\n> Please keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers—we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources\n> \n> — Amazon.com Help[90]\n> \n\n\n### Physical stores[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in University Village in Seattle. The store is 5,500 square feet and prices for all products match those on its website.[91] Amazon opened its tenth physical book store in 2017;[92] media speculation suggests that Amazon plans to eventually roll out 300 to 400 bookstores around the country.[91]\n\n\nIn June 2018, it was reported that Amazon planned to open brick and mortar bookstores in Germany.[93]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Amazon applied to have a liquor store in San Francisco, CA, as a means to ship beer and alcohol within the city.[94]\n\n\nIn 2020, Amazon Fresh opened several physical stores in the US and the United Kingdom.[95]\n\n\n\n### Hardware and services[edit]\n\n\nAmazon has a number of products and services available, including its digital assistant Alexa, Amazon Music and Prime Video for music and videos respectively, the Amazon Appstore for Android apps, the Kindle line of eink e-readers, Fire and Fire HD color LCD tablets. Audible provides audiobooks for purchase and listening.\n\n\nIn September 2021, Amazon announced the launch of Astro, its first household robot, powered by its Alexa smart home technology. This can be remote-controlled when not at home, to check on pets, people, or home security. It will send owners a notification if it detects something unusual.[96]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Amazon announced the launch of RXPass, a prescription drug delivery service. It allows US Amazon Prime members to pay a $5 monthly fee for access to 60 medications. The service was launched immediately after the announcement except in states with specific prescription delivery requirements. Beneficiaries of government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will not be able to sign up for RXPass.[97]\n\n\n\n### Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Amazon\n\nAmazon owns over 100 subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, Audible, Diapers.com, Goodreads, IMDb, Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics), Shopbop, Teachstreet, Twitch, Zappos, and Zoox.[98]\n\n\n\n#### Amazon Web Services[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon Web Services\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

The deal closed in March 2008 and Audible became a subsidiary of Amazon.[101]\n\n\n\n#### Goodreads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Goodreads\n\nGoodreads is a \"social cataloging\" website founded in December 2006 and launched in January 2007 by Otis Chandler, a software engineer, and entrepreneur, and Elizabeth Khuri. The website allows individuals to freely search Goodreads' extensive user-populated database of books, annotations, and reviews. Users can sign up and register books to generate library catalogs and reading lists. They can also create their groups of book suggestions and discussions. In December 2007, the site had over 650,000 members, and over a million books had been added. Amazon bought the company in March 2013.[102]\n\n\n\n#### Ring[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ring (company)\n\nRing is a home automation company founded by Jamie Siminoff in 2013. It is primarily known for its WiFi powered smart doorbells, but manufactures other devices such as security cameras.

Twitch was acquired by Amazon in August 2014 for $970 million.[104] The site's rapid growth had been boosted primarily by the prominence of major esports competitions on the service, leading GameSpot senior esports editor Rod Breslau to have described the service as \"the ESPN of esports\".[105] As of 2015[update], the service had over 1.5 million broadcasters and 100 million monthly viewers.[106]\n\n\n\n#### Whole Foods Market[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Whole Foods Market store in Ann Arbor, Michigan\nWhole Foods Market is an American supermarket chain exclusively featuring foods without artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats.[107] Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August 2017.[108][109][9]\n\n\n\n#### Other[edit]\n\n\nOther Amazon subsidiaries include:\n\n\n\n* **A9.com**, a company focused on researching and building innovative technology; it has been a subsidiary since 2003.[110]\n* **Amazon Maritime**, Inc. holds a Federal Maritime Commission license to operate as a non-vessel-owning common carrier (NVOCC), which enables the company to manage its shipments from China into the United States.[111]\n* **Amazon Pharmacy** is an online delivery service dedicated to prescription drugs, launched in November 2020. The service provides discounts up to 80% for generic drugs and up to 40% for branded drugs for Prime subscribe users. The products can be purchased on the company's website or at over 50,000 bricks-and-mortar pharmacies in the United States.[112]\n* **Annapurna Labs**, an Israel-based microelectronics company reputedly for US$350–370M acquired by Amazon Web Services in January 2015 .[113][114][115]\n* **Beijing Century Joyo Courier Services**, which applied for a freight forwarding license with the US Maritime Commission. Amazon is also building out its logistics in trucking and air freight to potentially compete with UPS and FedEx.[116][117]\n* **Brilliance Audio**, an audiobook publisher founded in 1984 by Michael Snodgrass in Grand Haven, Michigan.[118] The company produced its first eight audio titles in 1985.[118] The company was purchased by Amazon in 2007 for an undisclosed amount.[119][120] At the time of the acquisition, Brilliance was producing 12–15 new titles a month.[120] It operates as an independent company within Amazon. In 1984, Brilliance Audio invented a technique for recording twice as much on the same cassette.[121] The technique involved recording on each of the two channels of each stereo track.[121] It has been credited with revolutionizing the burgeoning audiobook market in the mid-1980s since it made unabridged books affordable.[121]\n* **ComiXology**, a cloud-based digital comics platform with over 200 million comic downloads as of September 2013[update]. It offers a selection of more than 40,000 comic books and graphic novels across Android, iOS, Fire OS and Windows 8 devices and over a web browser. Amazon bought the company in April 2014.[122]\n* **CreateSpace**, which offers self-publishing services for independent content creators, publishers, film studios, and music labels, became a subsidiary in 2009.[123][124]\n* **Eero**, an electronics company specializing in mesh-networking Wifi devices founded as a startup in 2014 by Nick Weaver, Amos Schallich, and Nate Hardison to simplify and innovate the smart home.[125] Eero was acquired by Amazon in 2019 for US$97 million.[126] Eero has continued to operate under its banner and advertises its commitment to privacy despite early concerns from the company's acquisition.[127]\n* **Health Navigator** is a startup developing APIs for online health services acquired in October 2019. The startup will form part of Amazon Care, which is the company's employee healthcare service. This follows the 2018 purchase of PillPack for under $1 billion, which has also been included into Amazon Care.[128]\n* **Junglee**, a former online shopping service provided by Amazon that enabled customers to search for products from online and offline retailers in India. Junglee started as a virtual database that was used to extract information from the Internet and deliver it to enterprise applications. As it progressed, Junglee started to use its database technology to create a single window marketplace on the Internet by making every item from every supplier available for purchase. Web shoppers could locate, compare and transact millions of products from across the Internet shopping mall through one window.[129] Amazon acquired Junglee in 1998, and the website Junglee.com was launched in India in February 2012[130] as a comparison-shopping website. It curated and enabled searching for a diverse variety of products such as clothing, electronics, toys, jewelry, and video games, among others, across thousands of online and offline sellers. Millions of products are browsable, the client selects a price, and then they are directed to a seller. In November 2017, Amazon closed down Junglee.com and the former domain currently redirects to Amazon India.[131]\n* **Kuiper Systems**, a subsidiary of Amazon, set up to deploy a broadband satellite internet constellation with an announced 3,236 Low Earth orbit satellites to provide satellite based Internet connectivity.[132][133][134]\n* **Lab126**, developers of integrated consumer electronics such as the Kindle, became a subsidiary in 2004.[135]\n* **Shelfari**, a former social cataloging website for books. Shelfari users built virtual bookshelves of the titles which they owned or had read and they could rate, review, tag and discuss their books. Users could also create groups that other members could join, create discussions and talk about books, or other topics. Recommendations could be sent to friends on the site for what books to read. Amazon bought the company in August 2008.[102] Shelfari continued to function as an independent book social network within the Amazon until January 2016, when Amazon announced that it would be merging Shelfari with Goodreads and closing down Shelfari.[136][137]\n* **Souq**, the former largest e-commerce platform in the Arab world. The company launched in 2005 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and served multiple areas across the Middle East.[138] On March 28, 2017, Amazon acquired Souq.com for $580 million.[139] The company was re-branded as Amazon and its infrastructure was used to expand Amazon's online platform in the Middle East.[140]\n\n\nAmazon also has investments in renewable energy and plans to expand its position into the Canadian market through an investment in a new plant in Alberta.[141]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Amazon locations\n\n### Logistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon Transportation Services truck at an Amazon Logistics delivery station\nAmazon uses many different transportation services to deliver packages. Amazon-branded services include:\n\n\n\n* Amazon Air, a cargo airline for bulk transport, with last-mile delivery handled either by Amazon Flex, Amazon Logistics, or the US Postal Service.\n\n\n![](image)Amazon delivery station in La Crosse by the La Crosse airport\n* Amazon Flex, a smartphone app that enables individuals to act as independent contractors, delivering packages to customers from personal vehicles without uniforms. Deliveries include one or two hours Prime Now, same or next day Amazon Fresh groceries, and standard Amazon.com orders, in addition to orders from local stores that contract with Amazon.[142]\n* Amazon Logistics, in which Amazon contracts with small businesses (which it calls \"Delivery Service Partners\") to perform deliveries to customers. Each business has a fleet of approximately 20–40 Amazon-branded vans, and employees of the contractors wear Amazon uniforms. As of December 2020, it operates in the United States, Canada, Italy, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom.[143]\n* Amazon Prime Air is an experimental drone delivery service that delivers packages via drones to Amazon Prime subscribers in select cities.\n\n\nAmazon directly employs people to work at its warehouses, bulk distribution centers, staffed \"Amazon Hub Locker+\" locations, and delivery stations where drivers pick up packages. As of December 2020, it is not hiring delivery drivers as employees.[144]\n\n\nRakuten Intelligence estimated that in 2020 in the United States, the proportion of last-mile deliveries was 56% by Amazon's directly contracted services (mostly in urban areas), 30% by the US Postal Service (mostly in rural areas), and 14% by UPS.[145] In April 2021, Amazon reported to investors it had increased its in-house delivery capacity by 50% in the last 12 months (which included the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States).[146]\n\n\n\n### Supply chain[edit]\n\n\nAmazon first launched its distribution network in 1997 with two fulfillment centers in Seattle and New Castle, Delaware. Amazon has several types of distribution facilities consisting of cross-dock centers, fulfillment centers, sortation centers, delivery stations, Prime now hubs, and Prime air hubs. There are 75 fulfillment centers and 25 sortation centers with over 125,000 employees.[147][148] Employees are responsible for five basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. Some warehouses are partially automated with systems built by Amazon Robotics.[149]\n\n\nIn September 2006, Amazon launched a program called FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) whereby it could handle storage, packing and distribution of products and services for small sellers.[33]\n\n\n\n* ![Amazon.fr fulfillment center in Lauwin-Planque, France](image)\n\nAmazon.fr fulfillment center in Lauwin-Planque, France\n* ![Amazon.es fulfillment center in San Fernando de Henares, Spain](image)\n\nAmazon.es fulfillment center in San Fernando de Henares, Spain\n* ![Amazon.co.uk fulfillment center in Glenrothes, Scotland, UK](image)\n\nAmazon.co.uk fulfillment center in Glenrothes, Scotland, UK\n* ![Amazon.de fulfillment center in Graben, Germany](image)\n\nAmazon.de fulfillment center in Graben, Germany\n* ![Amazon.co.jp fulfillment center in Ichikawa, Japan](image)\n\nAmazon.co.jp fulfillment center in Ichikawa, Japan\n* ![Amazon fulfillment center in Macon, Georgia, US](image)\n\nAmazon fulfillment center in Macon, Georgia, US\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2016\nAs of June 2022[update], Amazon's board of directors were:[150]\n\n\n\n* Jeff Bezos, executive chairman, Amazon.com, Inc.\n* Andy Jassy, president and CEO, Amazon.com, Inc.\n* Keith B. Alexander, CEO of IronNet Cybersecurity, former NSA director\n* Edith W.

Weeks, chairman, president and CEO, Corning Inc.\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nAmazon.com is primarily a retail site with a sales revenue model; Amazon takes a small percentage of the sale price of each item that is sold through its website while also allowing companies to advertise their products by paying to be listed as featured products.[151] As of 2018[update], Amazon.com is ranked eighth on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[152]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year 2021, Amazon reported earnings of US$33.36 billion, with an annual revenue of US$469.82 billion, an increase of 21.7% over the previous fiscal cycle. Since 2007 sales increased from 14.835 billion to 469.822 billion, due to continued business expansion.[153]\n\n\nAmazon's market capitalization went over US$1 trillion again in early February 2020 after the announcement of the fourth quarter 2019 results.[154]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenue[155]in mil.

He also read many emails addressed by customers to his public email address.[174] One of Bezos's most well-known internal memos was his mandate for \"all teams\" to \"expose their data and functionality\" through service interfaces \"designed from the ground up to be externalizable\". This process, commonly known as a service-oriented architecture (SOA), resulted in mandatory dogfooding of services that would later be commercialized as part of AWS.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Lobbying[edit]\n\n\nAmazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property. According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve. Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5 million, $5 million and $9.5 million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.[175] In 2019, it spent $16.8 million and had a team of 104 lobbyists.[176]\n\n\nAmazon.com was a corporate member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) until it dropped membership following protests at its shareholders' meeting on May 24, 2012.[177]\n\n\nIn 2014, Amazon expanded its lobbying practices as it prepared to lobby the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its drone delivery program, hiring the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld lobbying firm in June.[178] Amazon and its lobbyists have visited with Federal Aviation Administration officials and aviation committees in Washington, D.C. to explain its plans to deliver packages.[179] In September 2020 this moved one step closer with the granting of a critical certificate by the FAA.[180]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Criticism of Amazon\n\n![](image)A sticker expressing an anti-Amazon message is pictured on the back of a street sign in Seattle.Amazon has attracted criticism for its actions, including: supplying law enforcement with facial recognition surveillance tools;[181] forming cloud computing partnerships with the CIA;[182] leading customers away from bookshops;[183] adversely impacting the environment;[184] placing a low priority on warehouse conditions for workers;[185] actively opposing unionization efforts;[186] remotely deleting content purchased by Amazon Kindle users; taking public subsidies; seeking to patent its 1-Click technology; engaging in anti-competitive actions and price discrimination;[23][24] and reclassifying LGBT books as adult content.[187][188] Criticism has also concerned various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the WikiLeaks website, works containing libel and material facilitating dogfight, cockfight, or pedophile activities. In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app. Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon.[189] Companies like Groupon, eBay and Taap.it countered Amazon's promotion by offering $10 off from their products.[190][191]\n\n\nThe company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone, \"that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\"[51] In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent.[192] In 2019, Amazon banned selling skin-lightening products after pushback from Minnesota health and environmental activists.[193] In 2022, a lawsuit filed by state attorney-general Letitia James was dismissed by the New York state court of appeals.[194]\n\n\nJane Friedman[195] discovered six listings of books fraudulently using her name, on Amazon and Goodreads. Amazon and Goodreads resisted removing the fraudulent titles until the author's complaints went viral on social media, in a blog post titled \"I Would Rather See My Books Get Pirated Than This (Or: Why Goodreads and Amazon Are Becoming Dumpster Fires).\"[196][197][198][199]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award\n* Amazon Pay\n* Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN)\n* Camelcamelcamel – a website that tracks the prices of products sold on Amazon.com\n* History of Amazon\n* Internal carbon pricing\n* List of book distributors\n* Statistically improbable phrases – Amazon.com's phrase extraction technique for indexing books\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Amazon.com, Inc. 2022 Form 10-K Annual Report\".

The company owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, among other products and services.[20] Meta is one of the world's most valuable companies and among the ten largest publicly traded corporations in the United States.[21] It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Google's parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\n\nIn addition to Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, Meta has also acquired Oculus (which it has integrated into Reality Labs), Mapillary, CTRL-Labs, and a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms; the company additionally endeavored into non-VR hardware, such as the discontinued Meta Portal smart displays line and presently partners with Luxottica through the Ray-Ban Stories series of smart glasses.[22][23] Despite endeavors into hardware, the company still relies on advertising for a vast majority of its revenue, which in 2022 made up 97.5 percent of its revenue.[12]\n\n\nOn October 28, 2021, the parent company of Facebook changed its name from Facebook, Inc., to Meta Platforms, Inc., to \"reflect its focus on building the metaverse\".[24] According to Meta, the term \"metaverse\" refers to the integrated environment that links all of the company's products and services.[25][26][27]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of Facebook and Initial public offering of Facebook\n\n![](image)Billboard on the Thomson Reuters building welcomes Facebook to Nasdaq, 2012\n![](image)Early chart of Facebook's stock\n![](image)Facebook corporate logo from 2019 to 2021\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series about |\n| Meta Platforms |\n| ![](image) |\n| * History\n\t+ Instagram\n\t+ WhatsApp\n* Acquisitions\n |\n| \nProducts and services |\n| Facebook\n* 2021 outage\n* Features\n\t+ Dating\n\t+ Feed\n\t+ Like button\n |\n| Other products\n* Instagram\n\t+ Threads\n* Messenger\n\t+ Kids\n* Meta AI\n* Meta Portal\n* Quest\n\t+ Quest 2\n\t+ Quest 3\n\t+ Supernatural\n* Ray-Ban Stories\n* WhatsApp\n |\n| \nPeople |\n| Executives and board members\n* Mark Zuckerberg\n* Sheryl Sandberg\n |\n| Notable employees\n* Adam Mosseri\n |\n| Related organizations\n* Oversight Board\n |\n| \nBusiness |\n| Criticism\n* Privacy concerns\n* Content management\n\t+ Censorship of\n\t+ Censorship by\n* Cambridge Analytica data scandal\n* 2020 ad boycotts\n* 2021 company files leak\n* WhatsApp security and privacy features\n* WhatsApp snooping scandal\n |\n| Litigation\n* *Young v.

IPO\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nFacebook filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on January 1, 2012.[28] The preliminary prospectus stated that the company sought to raise $5 billion, had 845 million monthly active users, and a website accruing 2.7 billion likes and comments daily.[29] After the IPO, Zuckerberg would retain a 22% ownership share in Facebook and would own 57% of the voting shares.[30]\n\n\nUnderwriters valued the shares at $38 each, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly public company.[31] On May 16, one day before the IPO, Facebook announced it would sell 25% more shares than originally planned due to high demand.[32] The IPO raised $16 billion, making it the third-largest in US history (slightly ahead of AT&T Wireless and behind only General Motors and Visa). The stock price left the company with a higher market capitalization than all but a few U.S. corporations—surpassing heavyweights such as Amazon, McDonald's, Disney, and Kraft Foods—and made Zuckerberg's stock worth $19 billion.[33][34] *The New York Times* stated that the offering overcame questions about Facebook's difficulties in attracting advertisers to transform the company into a \"must-own stock\". Jimmy Lee of JPMorgan Chase described it as \"the next great blue-chip\".[33] Writers at TechCrunch, on the other hand, expressed skepticism, stating, \"That's a big multiple to live up to, and Facebook will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation.\"[35]\n\n\nTrading in the stock, which began on May 18, was delayed that day due to technical problems with the Nasdaq exchange.[36] The stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, forcing underwriters to buy back shares to support the price.[37] At the closing bell, shares were valued at $38.23,[38] only $0.23 above the IPO price and down $3.82 from the opening bell value. The opening was widely described by the financial press as a disappointment.[39] The stock nonetheless set a new record for trading volume of an IPO.[40] On May 25, 2012, the stock ended its first full week of trading at $31.91, a 16.5% decline.[41]\n\n\nOn May 22, 2012, regulators from Wall Street's Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that they had begun to investigate whether banks underwriting Facebook had improperly shared information only with select clients rather than the general public. Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin subpoenaed Morgan Stanley over the same issue.[42] The allegations sparked \"fury\" among some investors and led to the immediate filing of several lawsuits, one of them a class action suit claiming more than $2.5 billion in losses due to the IPO.[43] Bloomberg estimated that retail investors may have lost approximately $630 million on Facebook stock since its debut.[44] Standard & Poor's added Facebook to its S&P 500 index on December 21, 2013.[45]\n\n\nOn May 2, 2014, Zuckerberg announced that the company would be changing its internal motto from \"Move fast and break things\" to \"Move fast with stable infrastructure\".[46][47] The earlier motto had been described as Zuckerberg's \"prime directive to his developers and team\" in a 2009 interview in *Business Insider*, in which he also said, \"Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.\"[48]\n\n\n\n### 2018–2020: Focus on the metaverse[edit]\n\n\nLasso was a short-video sharing app from Facebook similar to TikTok that was launched on iOS and Android in 2018 and was aimed at teenagers. On July 2, 2020, Facebook announced that Lasso would be shutting down on July 10.[49][50][51]\n\n\nIn 2018, the Oculus lead, Jason Rubin, sent his 50-page vision document titled \"The Metaverse\" to Facebook's leadership. In the document, Rubin acknowledged that Facebook's virtual reality business had not caught on as expected, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on content for early adopters. He also urged the company to execute fast and invest heavily in the vision, to shut out HTC, Apple, Google and other competitors in the VR space. Regarding other players' participation in the metaverse vision, he called for the company to build the \"metaverse\" to prevent their competitors from \"being in the VR business in a meaningful way at all\".[52]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Facebook founded Libra Networks, reportedly to develop their own stablecoin cryptocurrency.[53] Later, it was reported that Libra was being supported by financial companies such as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber. The consortium of companies was expected to pool in $10 million each to fund the launch of the cryptocurrency coin named Libra.[54] Depending on when it would receive approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory authority to operate as a payments service, the Libra Association had planned to launch a limited format cryptocurrency in 2021.[55] Libra was renamed Diem, before being shut down and sold in January 2022 after backlash from government regulators and the public.[56][57]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of online services including Facebook grew globally.[58] Zuckerberg predicted this would be a \"permanent acceleration\" that would continue after the pandemic.[58] Facebook hired aggressively, growing from 48,268 employees in March 2020 to more than 87,000 by September 2022.[58]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Rebrand as Meta[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Criticism of Facebook, Instagram § Impact on people, 2021 Facebook leak, and Frances Haugen\nSee also: Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal and 2020 Facebook ad boycotts\n\nFollowing a period of intense scrutiny and damaging whistleblower leaks, news started to emerge on October 21, 2021, about Facebook's plan to rebrand the company and to change its name.[59][60] In the Q3 2021 Earnings Call, on October 25, Mark Zuckerberg discussed the ongoing criticism of the company's social services and the way it operates, and pointed to the pivoting efforts to building the metaverse – without mentioning the rebranding and the name change.[61] The metaverse vision and the name change from Facebook, Inc. to Meta Platforms was introduced at Facebook Connect on October 28, 2021.[62] Based on Facebook's PR campaign, the name change reflects the company's shifting long term focus of building the metaverse, a digital extension of the physical world by social media, virtual reality and augmented reality features.[62][63]\n\n\n\"Meta\" had been registered as a trademark in the United States in 2018 (after an initial filing in 2015) for marketing, advertising, and computer services, by a Canadian company that provided big data analysis of scientific literature.[64] This company was acquired in 2017 by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), a foundation established by Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, and became one of their projects.[65] Following the rebranding announcement, CZI announced that it had already decided to deprioritize the earlier Meta project, that it would be transferring its rights to the name to Meta Platforms, and that the project would end in 2022.[66]\n\n\n\n### 2022–present: Declining profits and mass layoffs[edit]\n\n\nSoon after the rebranding, in early February 2022, Meta reported a greater-than-expected decline in profits in the fourth quarter of 2021.[67] It reported no growth in monthly users,[68] and indicated it expected revenue growth to stall.[67] It also expected measures taken by Apple, Inc. to protect user privacy to cost it some $10 billion in advertisement revenue, an amount equal to roughly 8% of its revenue for 2021.[69] In meeting with Meta staff the day after earnings were reported, Zuckerberg blamed competition for user attention, particularly from video-based apps such as TikTok.[70]\n\n\nThe 27% reduction in the company's share price which occurred in reaction to the news eliminated some $230 billion of value from Meta's market capitalization.[71] Bloomberg described the decline as \"an epic rout that, in its sheer scale, is unlike anything Wall Street or Silicon Valley has ever seen\".[71] Zuckerberg's net worth fell by as much as $31 billion.[72] Zuckerberg owns 13% of Meta, and the holding makes up the bulk of his wealth.[73][74]\n\n\nAccording to published reports by Bloomberg on March 30, 2022, Meta turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, a Meta representative said, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[75] In June 2022, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of 14 years, announced she would step down that year. Zuckerberg said that Javier Olivan would replace Sandberg, though in a \"more traditional\" role.[76]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Meta (except Meta-owned WhatsApp) and Instagram were banned in Russia and added to Russian list of terrorist and extremist organizations for alleged Russophobia amid ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.[77] Meta appealed against the ban but it was upheld by a Moscow court in June of the same year.[77]\n\n\nAlso in March 2022, Meta and Italian eyewear giant Luxottica released Ray-Ban Stories, a series of smartglasses which could play music and take pictures. Meta and Luxottica parent company EssilorLuxottica declined to disclose sales on the line of products as of September 2022, though Meta has expressed satisfaction with its customer feedback.[23][78][79]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Meta saw its first year-on-year revenue decline when its total revenue slipped by 1% to $28.8bn.[80] Analysts and journalists accredited the loss to its advertising business, which has been limited by Apple's app tracking transparency feature and the number of people who have opted not to be tracked by Meta apps. Zuckerberg also accredited the decline to increasing competition from TikTok.[81][82][83] On October 27, 2022, Meta's market value dropped to $268 billion, a loss of around $700 billion compared to 2021, and its shares fell by 24%. It lost its spot among the top 20 US companies by market cap, despite reaching the top 5 in the previous year.[84]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Meta laid off 11,000 employees, 13% of its workforce. Zuckerberg said the decision to aggressively increase Meta's investments had been a mistake, as he had wrongly predicted that the surge in e-commerce would last beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. He also attributed the decline to increased competition, a global economic downturn and \"ads signal loss\".[85] Plans to lay off a further 10,000 employees began in April 2023.[86] The layoffs were part of a general downturn in the technology industry, alongside layoffs by companies including Google, Amazon, Tesla, Snap, Twitter and Lyft.[87][88]\n\n\nMeta revenue surpassed analyst expectations for the first quarter of 2023 after announcing that it was increasing its focus on AI.[89] On July 6, 2023, Meta launched a new app, Threads, a competitor to Twitter.[90]\n\n\nIn July 2023, the company announced it was making Llama 2, its artificial intelligence model, available for commercial use via partnerships with major cloud providers like Microsoft. This was the first project to be unveiled out of Meta's generative AI group after it was set up in February. It would not charge access or usage but instead operate with an open-source model to allow Meta to ascertain what improvements need to be made. Prior to this announcement, Meta said it had no plans to release Llama 2 for commercial use. An earlier version of Llama was released to academics.[91][92]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Meta announced its permanent removal of news content from Facebook and Instagram in Canada due to the *Online News Act*, which requires Canadian news outlets to be compensated for content shared on its platform. The Online News Act will be effective by year-end, but Meta will not participate in the regulatory process.[93]\n\n\n\n## Mergers and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of mergers and acquisitions by Meta Platforms.\n\nMeta has acquired multiple companies (often identified as talent acquisitions).[94] One of its first major acquisitions was in April 2012, when it acquired Instagram for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock.[95] In October 2013, Facebook, Inc. acquired Onavo, an Israeli mobile web analytics company.[96][97] In February 2014, Facebook, Inc. announced it would buy mobile messaging company WhatsApp for US$19 billion in cash and stock.[98][99] Later that year, Facebook bought Oculus VR for $2.3 billion in cash and stock,[100] which released its first consumer virtual reality headset in 2016. In late November 2019, Facebook, Inc. announced the acquisition of the game developer Beat Games, responsible for developing one of that year's most popular VR games, *Beat Saber*.[101] In Late 2022 after Facebook Inc rebranded to Meta Platforms Inc, Oculus was rebranded to Meta Quest.\n\n\nIn May 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced it had acquired Giphy for a reported cash price of $400 million. It will be integrated with the Instagram team.[102] However, in August 2021, UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated that Facebook, Inc. might have to sell Giphy, after an investigation found that the deal between the two companies would harm competition in display advertising market.[103] Facebook, Inc. was fined $70 million by CMA for deliberately failing to report all information regarding the acquisition and the ongoing antitrust investigation.[104] In October 2022, the CMA ruled for a second time that Meta be required to divest Giphy, stating that Meta already controls half of the advertising in the UK. Meta agreed to the sale, though it stated that it disagrees with the decision itself.[105] In May 2023, Giphy was divested to Shutterstock for $53 million.[106]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced that it planned to purchase the customer-service platform and chatbot specialist startup Kustomer to promote companies to use their platform for business. It has been reported that Kustomer valued at slightly over $1 billion.[107] The deal was closed in February 2022 after regulatory approval.[108]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Meta acquired Lofelt, a Berlin-based haptic tech startup.[109]\n\n\n\n## Lobbying[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, Facebook, Inc. spent $19.7 million on lobbying, hiring 79 lobbyists. By 2019, it had spent $16.7 million on lobbying and had a team of 71 lobbyists, up from $12.6 million and 51 lobbyists in 2018.[110] Facebook was the largest spender of lobbying money among the Big Tech companies in 2020.[111] The lobbying team includes top congressional aide John Branscome, who was hired in September 2021, to help the company fend off threats from Democratic lawmakers and the Biden administration.[112]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lawsuits involving Meta Platforms\n\nNumerous lawsuits have been filed against the company, both when it was known as Facebook, Inc., and as Meta Platforms.\n\n\nIn March 2020, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) sued Facebook, for significant and persistent infringements of the rule on privacy involving the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. Every violation of the Privacy Act is subject to a theoretical cumulative liability of $1.7 million. The OAIC estimated that a total of 311,127 Australians had been exposed.[113]\n\n\nOn December 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and 46 states (excluding Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and South Dakota), the District of Columbia and the territory of Guam, launched *Federal Trade Commission v. Facebook* as an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook. The lawsuit concerns Facebook's acquisition of two competitors—Instagram and WhatsApp—and the ensuing monopolistic situation. FTC alleges that Facebook holds monopolistic power in the US social networking market and seeks to force the company to divest from Instagram and WhatsApp to break up the conglomerate.[114] William Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, argued the case will be difficult to win as it would require the government to create a counterfactual argument of an internet where the Facebook-WhatsApp-Instagram entity did not exist, and prove that harmed competition or consumers.[115]\n\n\nOn December 24, 2021, a court in Russia fined Meta for $27 million after the company declined to remove unspecified banned content. The fine was reportedly tied to the company's annual revenue in the country.[116]\n\n\nIn May 2022, a lawsuit was filed in Kenya against Meta and its local outsourcing company Sama. Allegedly, Meta has poor working conditions in Kenya for workers moderating Facebook posts. According to the lawsuit, 260 screeners were declared redundant with confusing reasoning. The lawsuit seeks financial compensation and an order that outsourced moderators be given the same health benefits and pay scale as Meta employees.[117][118]\n\n\nIn June 2022, 8 lawsuits were filed across the US over the allege that excessive exposure to platforms including Facebook and Instagram has led to attempted or actual suicides, eating disorders and sleeplessness, among other issues. The litigation follows a former Facebook employee's testimony in Congress that the company refused to take responsibility. The company noted that tools have been developed for parents to keep track of their children's activity on Instagram and set time limits in addition to Meta's \"Take a break\" reminders. In addition, the company is providing resources specific to eating disorders as well as developing AI to prevent children under the age of 13 signing up for Facebook or Instagram.[119]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Meta settled a lawsuit with the US Department of Justice. The lawsuit, which was filed in 2019, alleged that the company enabled housing discrimination through targeted advertising, as it allowed home owners and landlords to run housing ads excluding people based on sex, race, religion, and other characteristics. The US Department of Justice stated that this was in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Meta was handed a penalty of $115,054 and given until December 31, 2022, to shadow the algorithm tool.[120][121][122]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Meta was fined €390 million for violations of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation.[123]\n\n\nIn May 2023, the European Data Protection Board fined Meta a record €1.2 billion for breaching European Union data privacy laws by transferring personal data of Facebook users to servers in the U.S.[124]\n\n\n\n## Structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder, chairman and CEO of Meta, in 2012\n### Management[edit]\n\n\nMeta's key management consists of:[125][126]\n\n\n\n* Mark Zuckerberg, chairman and chief executive officer\n* Javier Olivan, chief operating officer\n* Sir Nick Clegg, president, global affairs\n* Susan Li, chief financial officer\n* Andrew Bosworth, chief technology officer\n* David Wehner, chief strategy officer\n* Chris Cox, chief product officer\n* Jennifer Newstead, chief legal officer\n\n\nAs of October 2022[update], Meta had 83,553 employees worldwide.\n\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nAs of June 2023, Meta's board consisted of the following directors;[127]\n\n\n\n* Mark Zuckerberg (chairman, co-founder, controlling shareholder, and chief executive officer)\n* Sheryl Sandberg (non-executive director and former chief operating officer)\n* Peggy Alford (non-executive director, executive vice president, global sales, PayPal)\n* Marc Andreessen (non-executive director, co-founder and general partner, Andreessen Horowitz)\n* Drew Houston (non-executive director, chairman and chief executive officer, Dropbox)\n* Nancy Killefer (non-executive director, senior partner, McKinsey & Company)\n* Robert M. Kimmitt (non-executive director, senior international counsel, WilmerHale)\n* Tracey Travis (non-executive director, executive vice president, chief financial officer, Estée Lauder Companies)\n* Tony Xu (non-executive director, chairman and chief executive officer, DoorDash)\n\n\n### Company governance[edit]\n\n\nEarly Facebook investor and Zuckerberg's former mentor, Roger McNamee described Facebook as having \"the most centralized decision-making structure I have ever encountered in a large company.\"[128] Nathan Schneider, a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder argued for transforming Facebook into a platform cooperative owned and governed by the users.[129]\n\n\nFacebook co-founder Chris Hughes has stated that chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has too much power, that the company is now a monopoly, and that, as a result, it should be split into multiple smaller companies. In an op-ed in *The New York Times*, Hughes said he was concerned that Zuckerberg had surrounded himself with a team that did not challenge him, and that it is the U.S. government's job to hold him accountable and curb his \"unchecked power\".[130] He also said that \"Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American.\"[131] Several U.S. politicians agreed with Hughes.[132] European Union Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager stated that splitting Facebook should be done only as \"a remedy of the very last resort\", and that it would not solve Facebook's underlying problems.[133]\n\n\n\n## Revenue[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRevenue  \n(in millions USD)\n| Year | Revenue | Growth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004 | $0.4[134] | —\n |\n| 2005 | $9[134] | 2150%\n |\n| 2006 | $48[134] | 433%\n |\n| 2007 | $153[134] | 219%\n |\n| 2008 | $280[135] | 83%\n |\n| 2009 | $775[136] | 177%\n |\n| 2010 | $2,000[137] | 158%\n |\n| 2011 | $3,711[138] | 86%\n |\n| 2012 | $5,089[139] | 37%\n |\n| 2013 | $7,872[139] | 55%\n |\n| 2014 | $12,466[140] | 58%\n |\n| 2015 | $17,928[141] | 44%\n |\n| 2016 | $27,638[142] | 54%\n |\n| 2017 | $40,653[143] | 47%\n |\n| 2018 | $55,838[144] | 37%\n |\n| 2019 | $70,697[144] | 27%\n |\n| 2020 | $85,965[145] | 22%\n |\n| 2021 | $117,929[146] | 37%\n |\n| 2022 | $116,609[13] | -1%\n |\n\n\nFacebook ranked No. 34 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue, with almost $86 billion in revenue[147] most of it coming from advertising.[148][149] One analysis of 2017 data determined that the company earned US$20.21 per user from advertising.[150]\n\n\nAccording to *New York*, since its rebranding, Meta has reportedly lost $500 billion as a result of new privacy measures put in place by companies such as Apple and Google which prevents Meta from gathering users' data.[151][152]\n\n\n\n### Number of advertisers[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Facebook announced it had reached two million active advertisers, with most of the gain coming from small businesses. An active advertiser was defined as an entity that had advertised on the Facebook platform in the last 28 days.[153] In March 2016, Facebook announced it had reached three million active advertisers with more than 70% from outside the United States.[154] Prices for advertising follow a variable pricing model based on auctioning ad placements, and potential engagement levels of the advertisement itself. Similar to other online advertising platforms like Google and Twitter, targeting of advertisements is one of the chief merits of digital advertising compared to traditional media. Marketing on Meta is employed through two methods based on the viewing habits, likes and shares, and purchasing data of the audience, namely targeted audiences and \"look alike\" audiences.[155]\n\n\n\n### Tax affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland § Multinational tax schemes, and Double Irish arrangement § Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n\nThe US IRS challenged the valuation Facebook used when it transferred IP from the US to Facebook Ireland (now Meta Platforms Ireland) in 2010 (which Facebook Ireland then revalued higher before charging out), as it was building its double Irish tax structure.[156][157] The case is ongoing and Meta faces a potential fine of $3–5bn.[158]\n\n\nThe US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 changed Facebook's global tax calculations. Meta Platforms Ireland is subject to the US GILTI tax of 10.5% on global intangible profits (i.e. Irish profits). On the basis that Meta Platforms Ireland Limited is paying some tax, the effective minimum US tax for Facebook Ireland will be circa 11%. In contrast, Meta Platforms Inc. would incur a special IP tax rate of 13.125% (the FDII rate) if its Irish business relocated to the US. Tax relief in the US (21% vs. Irish at the GILTI rate) and accelerated capital expensing, would make this effective US rate around 12%.[159][160][161]\n\n\nThe insignificance of the US/Irish tax difference was demonstrated when Facebook moved 1.5bn non-EU accounts to the US to limit exposure to GDPR.[162][163]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Offices[edit]\n\n\nUsers outside of the US and Canada contract with Meta's Irish subsidiary, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (formerly *Facebook Ireland Limited*), allowing Meta to avoid US taxes for all users in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and South America. Meta is making use of the Double Irish arrangement which allows it to pay 2–3% corporation tax on all international revenue.[164] In 2010, Facebook opened its fourth office, in Hyderabad, India,[165] which houses online advertising and developer support teams and provides support to users and advertisers.[166] In India, Meta is registered as Facebook India Online Services Pvt Ltd.[167] It also has support centers in Chittagong; Dublin;[*clarification needed*] California; Ireland; and Austin, Texas.[168][*not specific enough to verify*]\n\n\nFacebook opened its London headquarters in 2017 in Fitzrovia in central London. Facebook opened an office in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2018. The offices were initially home to the \"Connectivity Lab\", a group focused on bringing Internet access to those who do not have access to the Internet.[169] In April 2019, Facebook opened its Taiwan headquarters in Taipei.[170]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Meta opened new regional headquarters in Dubai.[171]\n\n\nIn September 2023, it was reported that Meta had paid £149m to British Land in order to break the lease on Triton Square London office. Meta reportedly had another 18 years left on its lease on the site.

She wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Initially, my experience with the Oculus went well. I attended work meetings as an avatar and tried an exercise class set in the streets of Paris. The headset enabled me to feel the thrill of carving down mountains on a snowboard and the adrenaline rush of climbing a mountain without ropes. Yet switching to the social apps, where you mingle with strangers also using VR headsets, it was at times predatory and vile.\n> \n> \n\n\nEccles described being sexually harassed by another user, as well as \"accents from all over the world, American, Indian, English, Australian, using racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic language\". She also encountered users as young as 7 years old on the platform, despite Oculus headsets being intended for users over 13.[180]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Big Tech\n* Criticism of Facebook\n* Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal\n* 2021 Facebook leak\n* Meta AI\n* *The Social Network*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Madrigal, Alexis C.

The company owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, among other products and services.[20] Meta is one of the world's most valuable companies and among the ten largest publicly traded corporations in the United States.[21] It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Google's parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\n\nIn addition to Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, Meta has also acquired Oculus (which it has integrated into Reality Labs), Mapillary, CTRL-Labs, and a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms; the company additionally endeavored into non-VR hardware, such as the discontinued Meta Portal smart displays line and presently partners with Luxottica through the Ray-Ban Stories series of smart glasses.[22][23] Despite endeavors into hardware, the company still relies on advertising for a vast majority of its revenue, which in 2022 made up 97.5 percent of its revenue.[12]\n\n\nOn October 28, 2021, the parent company of Facebook changed its name from Facebook, Inc., to Meta Platforms, Inc., to \"reflect its focus on building the metaverse\".[24] According to Meta, the term \"metaverse\" refers to the integrated environment that links all of the company's products and services.[25][26][27]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of Facebook and Initial public offering of Facebook\n\n![](image)Billboard on the Thomson Reuters building welcomes Facebook to Nasdaq, 2012\n![](image)Early chart of Facebook's stock\n![](image)Facebook corporate logo from 2019 to 2021\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series about |\n| Meta Platforms |\n| ![](image) |\n| * History\n\t+ Instagram\n\t+ WhatsApp\n* Acquisitions\n |\n| \nProducts and services |\n| Facebook\n* 2021 outage\n* Features\n\t+ Dating\n\t+ Feed\n\t+ Like button\n |\n| Other products\n* Instagram\n\t+ Threads\n* Messenger\n\t+ Kids\n* Meta AI\n* Meta Portal\n* Quest\n\t+ Quest 2\n\t+ Quest 3\n\t+ Supernatural\n* Ray-Ban Stories\n* WhatsApp\n |\n| \nPeople |\n| Executives and board members\n* Mark Zuckerberg\n* Sheryl Sandberg\n |\n| Notable employees\n* Adam Mosseri\n |\n| Related organizations\n* Oversight Board\n |\n| \nBusiness |\n| Criticism\n* Privacy concerns\n* Content management\n\t+ Censorship of\n\t+ Censorship by\n* Cambridge Analytica data scandal\n* 2020 ad boycotts\n* 2021 company files leak\n* WhatsApp security and privacy features\n* WhatsApp snooping scandal\n |\n| Litigation\n* *Young v.

IPO\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nFacebook filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on January 1, 2012.[28] The preliminary prospectus stated that the company sought to raise $5 billion, had 845 million monthly active users, and a website accruing 2.7 billion likes and comments daily.[29] After the IPO, Zuckerberg would retain a 22% ownership share in Facebook and would own 57% of the voting shares.[30]\n\n\nUnderwriters valued the shares at $38 each, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly public company.[31] On May 16, one day before the IPO, Facebook announced it would sell 25% more shares than originally planned due to high demand.[32] The IPO raised $16 billion, making it the third-largest in US history (slightly ahead of AT&T Wireless and behind only General Motors and Visa). The stock price left the company with a higher market capitalization than all but a few U.S. corporations—surpassing heavyweights such as Amazon, McDonald's, Disney, and Kraft Foods—and made Zuckerberg's stock worth $19 billion.[33][34] *The New York Times* stated that the offering overcame questions about Facebook's difficulties in attracting advertisers to transform the company into a \"must-own stock\". Jimmy Lee of JPMorgan Chase described it as \"the next great blue-chip\".[33] Writers at TechCrunch, on the other hand, expressed skepticism, stating, \"That's a big multiple to live up to, and Facebook will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation.\"[35]\n\n\nTrading in the stock, which began on May 18, was delayed that day due to technical problems with the Nasdaq exchange.[36] The stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, forcing underwriters to buy back shares to support the price.[37] At the closing bell, shares were valued at $38.23,[38] only $0.23 above the IPO price and down $3.82 from the opening bell value. The opening was widely described by the financial press as a disappointment.[39] The stock nonetheless set a new record for trading volume of an IPO.[40] On May 25, 2012, the stock ended its first full week of trading at $31.91, a 16.5% decline.[41]\n\n\nOn May 22, 2012, regulators from Wall Street's Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that they had begun to investigate whether banks underwriting Facebook had improperly shared information only with select clients rather than the general public. Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin subpoenaed Morgan Stanley over the same issue.[42] The allegations sparked \"fury\" among some investors and led to the immediate filing of several lawsuits, one of them a class action suit claiming more than $2.5 billion in losses due to the IPO.[43] Bloomberg estimated that retail investors may have lost approximately $630 million on Facebook stock since its debut.[44] Standard & Poor's added Facebook to its S&P 500 index on December 21, 2013.[45]\n\n\nOn May 2, 2014, Zuckerberg announced that the company would be changing its internal motto from \"Move fast and break things\" to \"Move fast with stable infrastructure\".[46][47] The earlier motto had been described as Zuckerberg's \"prime directive to his developers and team\" in a 2009 interview in *Business Insider*, in which he also said, \"Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.\"[48]\n\n\n\n### 2018–2020: Focus on the metaverse[edit]\n\n\nLasso was a short-video sharing app from Facebook similar to TikTok that was launched on iOS and Android in 2018 and was aimed at teenagers. On July 2, 2020, Facebook announced that Lasso would be shutting down on July 10.[49][50][51]\n\n\nIn 2018, the Oculus lead, Jason Rubin, sent his 50-page vision document titled \"The Metaverse\" to Facebook's leadership. In the document, Rubin acknowledged that Facebook's virtual reality business had not caught on as expected, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on content for early adopters. He also urged the company to execute fast and invest heavily in the vision, to shut out HTC, Apple, Google and other competitors in the VR space. Regarding other players' participation in the metaverse vision, he called for the company to build the \"metaverse\" to prevent their competitors from \"being in the VR business in a meaningful way at all\".[52]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Facebook founded Libra Networks, reportedly to develop their own stablecoin cryptocurrency.[53] Later, it was reported that Libra was being supported by financial companies such as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber. The consortium of companies was expected to pool in $10 million each to fund the launch of the cryptocurrency coin named Libra.[54] Depending on when it would receive approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory authority to operate as a payments service, the Libra Association had planned to launch a limited format cryptocurrency in 2021.[55] Libra was renamed Diem, before being shut down and sold in January 2022 after backlash from government regulators and the public.[56][57]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of online services including Facebook grew globally.[58] Zuckerberg predicted this would be a \"permanent acceleration\" that would continue after the pandemic.[58] Facebook hired aggressively, growing from 48,268 employees in March 2020 to more than 87,000 by September 2022.[58]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Rebrand as Meta[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Criticism of Facebook, Instagram § Impact on people, 2021 Facebook leak, and Frances Haugen\nSee also: Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal and 2020 Facebook ad boycotts\n\nFollowing a period of intense scrutiny and damaging whistleblower leaks, news started to emerge on October 21, 2021, about Facebook's plan to rebrand the company and to change its name.[59][60] In the Q3 2021 Earnings Call, on October 25, Mark Zuckerberg discussed the ongoing criticism of the company's social services and the way it operates, and pointed to the pivoting efforts to building the metaverse – without mentioning the rebranding and the name change.[61] The metaverse vision and the name change from Facebook, Inc. to Meta Platforms was introduced at Facebook Connect on October 28, 2021.[62] Based on Facebook's PR campaign, the name change reflects the company's shifting long term focus of building the metaverse, a digital extension of the physical world by social media, virtual reality and augmented reality features.[62][63]\n\n\n\"Meta\" had been registered as a trademark in the United States in 2018 (after an initial filing in 2015) for marketing, advertising, and computer services, by a Canadian company that provided big data analysis of scientific literature.[64] This company was acquired in 2017 by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), a foundation established by Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, and became one of their projects.[65] Following the rebranding announcement, CZI announced that it had already decided to deprioritize the earlier Meta project, that it would be transferring its rights to the name to Meta Platforms, and that the project would end in 2022.[66]\n\n\n\n### 2022–present: Declining profits and mass layoffs[edit]\n\n\nSoon after the rebranding, in early February 2022, Meta reported a greater-than-expected decline in profits in the fourth quarter of 2021.[67] It reported no growth in monthly users,[68] and indicated it expected revenue growth to stall.[67] It also expected measures taken by Apple, Inc. to protect user privacy to cost it some $10 billion in advertisement revenue, an amount equal to roughly 8% of its revenue for 2021.[69] In meeting with Meta staff the day after earnings were reported, Zuckerberg blamed competition for user attention, particularly from video-based apps such as TikTok.[70]\n\n\nThe 27% reduction in the company's share price which occurred in reaction to the news eliminated some $230 billion of value from Meta's market capitalization.[71] Bloomberg described the decline as \"an epic rout that, in its sheer scale, is unlike anything Wall Street or Silicon Valley has ever seen\".[71] Zuckerberg's net worth fell by as much as $31 billion.[72] Zuckerberg owns 13% of Meta, and the holding makes up the bulk of his wealth.[73][74]\n\n\nAccording to published reports by Bloomberg on March 30, 2022, Meta turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, a Meta representative said, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[75] In June 2022, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of 14 years, announced she would step down that year. Zuckerberg said that Javier Olivan would replace Sandberg, though in a \"more traditional\" role.[76]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Meta (except Meta-owned WhatsApp) and Instagram were banned in Russia and added to Russian list of terrorist and extremist organizations for alleged Russophobia amid ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.[77] Meta appealed against the ban but it was upheld by a Moscow court in June of the same year.[77]\n\n\nAlso in March 2022, Meta and Italian eyewear giant Luxottica released Ray-Ban Stories, a series of smartglasses which could play music and take pictures. Meta and Luxottica parent company EssilorLuxottica declined to disclose sales on the line of products as of September 2022, though Meta has expressed satisfaction with its customer feedback.[23][78][79]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Meta saw its first year-on-year revenue decline when its total revenue slipped by 1% to $28.8bn.[80] Analysts and journalists accredited the loss to its advertising business, which has been limited by Apple's app tracking transparency feature and the number of people who have opted not to be tracked by Meta apps. Zuckerberg also accredited the decline to increasing competition from TikTok.[81][82][83] On October 27, 2022, Meta's market value dropped to $268 billion, a loss of around $700 billion compared to 2021, and its shares fell by 24%. It lost its spot among the top 20 US companies by market cap, despite reaching the top 5 in the previous year.[84]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Meta laid off 11,000 employees, 13% of its workforce. Zuckerberg said the decision to aggressively increase Meta's investments had been a mistake, as he had wrongly predicted that the surge in e-commerce would last beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. He also attributed the decline to increased competition, a global economic downturn and \"ads signal loss\".[85] Plans to lay off a further 10,000 employees began in April 2023.[86] The layoffs were part of a general downturn in the technology industry, alongside layoffs by companies including Google, Amazon, Tesla, Snap, Twitter and Lyft.[87][88]\n\n\nMeta revenue surpassed analyst expectations for the first quarter of 2023 after announcing that it was increasing its focus on AI.[89] On July 6, 2023, Meta launched a new app, Threads, a competitor to Twitter.[90]\n\n\nIn July 2023, the company announced it was making Llama 2, its artificial intelligence model, available for commercial use via partnerships with major cloud providers like Microsoft. This was the first project to be unveiled out of Meta's generative AI group after it was set up in February. It would not charge access or usage but instead operate with an open-source model to allow Meta to ascertain what improvements need to be made. Prior to this announcement, Meta said it had no plans to release Llama 2 for commercial use. An earlier version of Llama was released to academics.[91][92]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Meta announced its permanent removal of news content from Facebook and Instagram in Canada due to the *Online News Act*, which requires Canadian news outlets to be compensated for content shared on its platform. The Online News Act will be effective by year-end, but Meta will not participate in the regulatory process.[93]\n\n\n\n## Mergers and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of mergers and acquisitions by Meta Platforms.\n\nMeta has acquired multiple companies (often identified as talent acquisitions).[94] One of its first major acquisitions was in April 2012, when it acquired Instagram for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock.[95] In October 2013, Facebook, Inc. acquired Onavo, an Israeli mobile web analytics company.[96][97] In February 2014, Facebook, Inc. announced it would buy mobile messaging company WhatsApp for US$19 billion in cash and stock.[98][99] Later that year, Facebook bought Oculus VR for $2.3 billion in cash and stock,[100] which released its first consumer virtual reality headset in 2016. In late November 2019, Facebook, Inc. announced the acquisition of the game developer Beat Games, responsible for developing one of that year's most popular VR games, *Beat Saber*.[101] In Late 2022 after Facebook Inc rebranded to Meta Platforms Inc, Oculus was rebranded to Meta Quest.\n\n\nIn May 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced it had acquired Giphy for a reported cash price of $400 million. It will be integrated with the Instagram team.[102] However, in August 2021, UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated that Facebook, Inc. might have to sell Giphy, after an investigation found that the deal between the two companies would harm competition in display advertising market.[103] Facebook, Inc. was fined $70 million by CMA for deliberately failing to report all information regarding the acquisition and the ongoing antitrust investigation.[104] In October 2022, the CMA ruled for a second time that Meta be required to divest Giphy, stating that Meta already controls half of the advertising in the UK. Meta agreed to the sale, though it stated that it disagrees with the decision itself.[105] In May 2023, Giphy was divested to Shutterstock for $53 million.[106]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced that it planned to purchase the customer-service platform and chatbot specialist startup Kustomer to promote companies to use their platform for business. It has been reported that Kustomer valued at slightly over $1 billion.[107] The deal was closed in February 2022 after regulatory approval.[108]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Meta acquired Lofelt, a Berlin-based haptic tech startup.[109]\n\n\n\n## Lobbying[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, Facebook, Inc. spent $19.7 million on lobbying, hiring 79 lobbyists. By 2019, it had spent $16.7 million on lobbying and had a team of 71 lobbyists, up from $12.6 million and 51 lobbyists in 2018.[110] Facebook was the largest spender of lobbying money among the Big Tech companies in 2020.[111] The lobbying team includes top congressional aide John Branscome, who was hired in September 2021, to help the company fend off threats from Democratic lawmakers and the Biden administration.[112]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lawsuits involving Meta Platforms\n\nNumerous lawsuits have been filed against the company, both when it was known as Facebook, Inc., and as Meta Platforms.\n\n\nIn March 2020, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) sued Facebook, for significant and persistent infringements of the rule on privacy involving the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. Every violation of the Privacy Act is subject to a theoretical cumulative liability of $1.7 million. The OAIC estimated that a total of 311,127 Australians had been exposed.[113]\n\n\nOn December 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and 46 states (excluding Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and South Dakota), the District of Columbia and the territory of Guam, launched *Federal Trade Commission v. Facebook* as an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook. The lawsuit concerns Facebook's acquisition of two competitors—Instagram and WhatsApp—and the ensuing monopolistic situation. FTC alleges that Facebook holds monopolistic power in the US social networking market and seeks to force the company to divest from Instagram and WhatsApp to break up the conglomerate.[114] William Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, argued the case will be difficult to win as it would require the government to create a counterfactual argument of an internet where the Facebook-WhatsApp-Instagram entity did not exist, and prove that harmed competition or consumers.[115]\n\n\nOn December 24, 2021, a court in Russia fined Meta for $27 million after the company declined to remove unspecified banned content. The fine was reportedly tied to the company's annual revenue in the country.[116]\n\n\nIn May 2022, a lawsuit was filed in Kenya against Meta and its local outsourcing company Sama. Allegedly, Meta has poor working conditions in Kenya for workers moderating Facebook posts. According to the lawsuit, 260 screeners were declared redundant with confusing reasoning. The lawsuit seeks financial compensation and an order that outsourced moderators be given the same health benefits and pay scale as Meta employees.[117][118]\n\n\nIn June 2022, 8 lawsuits were filed across the US over the allege that excessive exposure to platforms including Facebook and Instagram has led to attempted or actual suicides, eating disorders and sleeplessness, among other issues. The litigation follows a former Facebook employee's testimony in Congress that the company refused to take responsibility. The company noted that tools have been developed for parents to keep track of their children's activity on Instagram and set time limits in addition to Meta's \"Take a break\" reminders. In addition, the company is providing resources specific to eating disorders as well as developing AI to prevent children under the age of 13 signing up for Facebook or Instagram.[119]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Meta settled a lawsuit with the US Department of Justice. The lawsuit, which was filed in 2019, alleged that the company enabled housing discrimination through targeted advertising, as it allowed home owners and landlords to run housing ads excluding people based on sex, race, religion, and other characteristics. The US Department of Justice stated that this was in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Meta was handed a penalty of $115,054 and given until December 31, 2022, to shadow the algorithm tool.[120][121][122]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Meta was fined €390 million for violations of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation.[123]\n\n\nIn May 2023, the European Data Protection Board fined Meta a record €1.2 billion for breaching European Union data privacy laws by transferring personal data of Facebook users to servers in the U.S.[124]\n\n\n\n## Structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder, chairman and CEO of Meta, in 2012\n### Management[edit]\n\n\nMeta's key management consists of:[125][126]\n\n\n\n* Mark Zuckerberg, chairman and chief executive officer\n* Javier Olivan, chief operating officer\n* Sir Nick Clegg, president, global affairs\n* Susan Li, chief financial officer\n* Andrew Bosworth, chief technology officer\n* David Wehner, chief strategy officer\n* Chris Cox, chief product officer\n* Jennifer Newstead, chief legal officer\n\n\nAs of October 2022[update], Meta had 83,553 employees worldwide.\n\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nAs of June 2023, Meta's board consisted of the following directors;[127]\n\n\n\n* Mark Zuckerberg (chairman, co-founder, controlling shareholder, and chief executive officer)\n* Sheryl Sandberg (non-executive director and former chief operating officer)\n* Peggy Alford (non-executive director, executive vice president, global sales, PayPal)\n* Marc Andreessen (non-executive director, co-founder and general partner, Andreessen Horowitz)\n* Drew Houston (non-executive director, chairman and chief executive officer, Dropbox)\n* Nancy Killefer (non-executive director, senior partner, McKinsey & Company)\n* Robert M. Kimmitt (non-executive director, senior international counsel, WilmerHale)\n* Tracey Travis (non-executive director, executive vice president, chief financial officer, Estée Lauder Companies)\n* Tony Xu (non-executive director, chairman and chief executive officer, DoorDash)\n\n\n### Company governance[edit]\n\n\nEarly Facebook investor and Zuckerberg's former mentor, Roger McNamee described Facebook as having \"the most centralized decision-making structure I have ever encountered in a large company.\"[128] Nathan Schneider, a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder argued for transforming Facebook into a platform cooperative owned and governed by the users.[129]\n\n\nFacebook co-founder Chris Hughes has stated that chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has too much power, that the company is now a monopoly, and that, as a result, it should be split into multiple smaller companies. In an op-ed in *The New York Times*, Hughes said he was concerned that Zuckerberg had surrounded himself with a team that did not challenge him, and that it is the U.S. government's job to hold him accountable and curb his \"unchecked power\".[130] He also said that \"Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American.\"[131] Several U.S. politicians agreed with Hughes.[132] European Union Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager stated that splitting Facebook should be done only as \"a remedy of the very last resort\", and that it would not solve Facebook's underlying problems.[133]\n\n\n\n## Revenue[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRevenue  \n(in millions USD)\n| Year | Revenue | Growth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004 | $0.4[134] | —\n |\n| 2005 | $9[134] | 2150%\n |\n| 2006 | $48[134] | 433%\n |\n| 2007 | $153[134] | 219%\n |\n| 2008 | $280[135] | 83%\n |\n| 2009 | $775[136] | 177%\n |\n| 2010 | $2,000[137] | 158%\n |\n| 2011 | $3,711[138] | 86%\n |\n| 2012 | $5,089[139] | 37%\n |\n| 2013 | $7,872[139] | 55%\n |\n| 2014 | $12,466[140] | 58%\n |\n| 2015 | $17,928[141] | 44%\n |\n| 2016 | $27,638[142] | 54%\n |\n| 2017 | $40,653[143] | 47%\n |\n| 2018 | $55,838[144] | 37%\n |\n| 2019 | $70,697[144] | 27%\n |\n| 2020 | $85,965[145] | 22%\n |\n| 2021 | $117,929[146] | 37%\n |\n| 2022 | $116,609[13] | -1%\n |\n\n\nFacebook ranked No. 34 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue, with almost $86 billion in revenue[147] most of it coming from advertising.[148][149] One analysis of 2017 data determined that the company earned US$20.21 per user from advertising.[150]\n\n\nAccording to *New York*, since its rebranding, Meta has reportedly lost $500 billion as a result of new privacy measures put in place by companies such as Apple and Google which prevents Meta from gathering users' data.[151][152]\n\n\n\n### Number of advertisers[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Facebook announced it had reached two million active advertisers, with most of the gain coming from small businesses. An active advertiser was defined as an entity that had advertised on the Facebook platform in the last 28 days.[153] In March 2016, Facebook announced it had reached three million active advertisers with more than 70% from outside the United States.[154] Prices for advertising follow a variable pricing model based on auctioning ad placements, and potential engagement levels of the advertisement itself. Similar to other online advertising platforms like Google and Twitter, targeting of advertisements is one of the chief merits of digital advertising compared to traditional media. Marketing on Meta is employed through two methods based on the viewing habits, likes and shares, and purchasing data of the audience, namely targeted audiences and \"look alike\" audiences.[155]\n\n\n\n### Tax affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland § Multinational tax schemes, and Double Irish arrangement § Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n\nThe US IRS challenged the valuation Facebook used when it transferred IP from the US to Facebook Ireland (now Meta Platforms Ireland) in 2010 (which Facebook Ireland then revalued higher before charging out), as it was building its double Irish tax structure.[156][157] The case is ongoing and Meta faces a potential fine of $3–5bn.[158]\n\n\nThe US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 changed Facebook's global tax calculations. Meta Platforms Ireland is subject to the US GILTI tax of 10.5% on global intangible profits (i.e. Irish profits). On the basis that Meta Platforms Ireland Limited is paying some tax, the effective minimum US tax for Facebook Ireland will be circa 11%. In contrast, Meta Platforms Inc. would incur a special IP tax rate of 13.125% (the FDII rate) if its Irish business relocated to the US. Tax relief in the US (21% vs. Irish at the GILTI rate) and accelerated capital expensing, would make this effective US rate around 12%.[159][160][161]\n\n\nThe insignificance of the US/Irish tax difference was demonstrated when Facebook moved 1.5bn non-EU accounts to the US to limit exposure to GDPR.[162][163]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Offices[edit]\n\n\nUsers outside of the US and Canada contract with Meta's Irish subsidiary, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (formerly *Facebook Ireland Limited*), allowing Meta to avoid US taxes for all users in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and South America. Meta is making use of the Double Irish arrangement which allows it to pay 2–3% corporation tax on all international revenue.[164] In 2010, Facebook opened its fourth office, in Hyderabad, India,[165] which houses online advertising and developer support teams and provides support to users and advertisers.[166] In India, Meta is registered as Facebook India Online Services Pvt Ltd.[167] It also has support centers in Chittagong; Dublin;[*clarification needed*] California; Ireland; and Austin, Texas.[168][*not specific enough to verify*]\n\n\nFacebook opened its London headquarters in 2017 in Fitzrovia in central London. Facebook opened an office in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2018. The offices were initially home to the \"Connectivity Lab\", a group focused on bringing Internet access to those who do not have access to the Internet.[169] In April 2019, Facebook opened its Taiwan headquarters in Taipei.[170]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Meta opened new regional headquarters in Dubai.[171]\n\n\nIn September 2023, it was reported that Meta had paid £149m to British Land in order to break the lease on Triton Square London office. Meta reportedly had another 18 years left on its lease on the site.

She wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Initially, my experience with the Oculus went well. I attended work meetings as an avatar and tried an exercise class set in the streets of Paris. The headset enabled me to feel the thrill of carving down mountains on a snowboard and the adrenaline rush of climbing a mountain without ropes. Yet switching to the social apps, where you mingle with strangers also using VR headsets, it was at times predatory and vile.\n> \n> \n\n\nEccles described being sexually harassed by another user, as well as \"accents from all over the world, American, Indian, English, Australian, using racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic language\". She also encountered users as young as 7 years old on the platform, despite Oculus headsets being intended for users over 13.[180]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Big Tech\n* Criticism of Facebook\n* Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal\n* 2021 Facebook leak\n* Meta AI\n* *The Social Network*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Madrigal, Alexis C.

Its subsidiary Tesla Energy develops and is a major installer of photovoltaic systems in the United States and is one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems with 6.5 gigawatt-hours (GWh) installed in 2022.\n\n\nTesla is one of the world's most valuable companies and, as of 2023[update], is the world's most valuable automaker. In 2022, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 18% share.\n\n\nTesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a $6.5 million investment, Elon Musk became the company's largest shareholder. He became CEO in 2008. Tesla's announced mission is to create products which help \"accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.\"\n\n\nThe company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, in 2008. This was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck light-duty pickup truck in 2023.[7] The Model 3 is the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[8] Tesla's 2022 deliveries were around 1.31 million vehicles, a 40% increase over the previous year,[9][10] and cumulative sales totaled 4 million cars as of April 2023.[11] In October 2021, Tesla's market capitalization temporarily reached $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history.\n\n\nTesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations, product defects, and Musk's many controversial statements.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Tesla, Inc.\n\n![](image)Tesla Motors insignia as seen on a Tesla Roadster, c. 2010\n### Founding (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\nThe company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[12][13] Eberhard and Tarpenning served as CEO and CFO, respectively.[14] Eberhard said that he wanted to build \"a car manufacturer that is also a technology company\", with its core technologies as \"the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor\".[15]\n\n\nIan Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later.[12] In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12 million in 2023) in series A funding, including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10 million in 2023) from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.[16][17][14] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[18]\n\n\nA lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.[19]\n\n\n\n### Roadster (2005–2009)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Roadster (first generation)\n\nElon Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[20] The company's strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[21]\n\n\nIn February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team.[22][17] Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll.[23] A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.[23]\n\n\nTesla's first car, the Roadster, was officially revealed to the public on July 19, 2006, in Santa Monica, California, at a 350-person invitation-only event held in Barker Hangar at Santa Monica Airport.[24]\n\n\nIn August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO.[25] Eberhard then took the title of \"President of Technology\" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008. Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008.[26] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and President.[27] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[27] In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[28]\n\n\nTesla began production of the Roadster in 2008 inside the service bays of a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park.[29][30] By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed $70 million of his own money to the company.[31]\n\n\nIn June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive $465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy. The funding, part of the $8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supported the engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology.[32] Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with $12 million in interest.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### IPO, Model S, and Model X (2010–2015)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First deliveries of Model S at the Tesla Fremont Factory in California, in June 2012\nIn May 2010, Tesla purchased what would later become the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California, from Toyota for $42 million,[35] and opened the facility in October 2010 to start production of the Model S.[36] On June 29, 2010, the company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ, the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956.[37] The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17 per share, raising $226 million.[38]\n\n\nIn January 2012, Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan.[39] The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year,[40] and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it achieved first place in the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013.[41] The Model S was also the bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016.[42]\n\n\nTesla announced the Tesla Autopilot, a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called \"hardware version 1\".[43]\n\n\nTesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business) battery packs in April 2015.[44] The company received orders valued at $800 million within a week of the unveiling.[45]\n\n\nTesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at the time.[46][47]\n\n\n\n### SolarCity and Model 3 (2016–2018)[edit]\n\n\nTesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6 billion deal.[48] The business was merged with Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy subsidiary.[49] The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of which Tesla's shareholders were not informed.[50] In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better reflect the scope of its expanded business.[51]\n\n\nTesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. Compared to Tesla's previous luxury vehicles, the Model 3 was less expensive and within a week the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[52] In an effort to speed up production and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3. Instead, the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles,[53] leading to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company would later come to describe as \"production hell.\"[54][55] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 would become the world's bestselling electric car from 2018 to 2021.[56][57]\n\n\nThis period of production hell put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private.[58][59] The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC, which would force Musk to step down as the company's chairman, although he was allowed to remain CEO.\n\n\n\n### Global expansion and Model Y (2019–present)[edit]\n\n\nFrom July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500.[60] Tesla was added to the index on December 21, 2020.[61] It was the most valuable company ever added, already the sixth-largest member.[61] During 2020, the share price increased 740%,[62] and on January 26, 2021, its market capitalization reached $848 billion,[63] more than the next nine largest automakers combined and becoming the US' 5th most valuable company.[64][65] In July 2020, Tesla reached a valuation of $206 billion, surpassing Toyota to become the world's most valuable automaker.[66] On August 31, 2020, Tesla completed a 5-for-1 stock split.[67]\n\n\nTesla introduced its second mass-market vehicle in March 2019, the Model Y mid-size crossover SUV, based on the Model 3.[68][69] Deliveries started in March 2020.[70]\n\n\nDuring this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession. Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company (not a joint venture).[71] The first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out of the factory in December, less than one year after groundbreaking.[72] Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg broke ground in February 2020,[73] and production of the Model Y began in March 2022.[74] Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June 2020,[75] and production of the Model Y began in April 2022.[76] Tesla has also announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in 2025.[77]\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the entire automotive industry, and Tesla was no exception. Government officials in China closed Gigafactory Shanghai and lawmakers in California shut down production at the Tesla Fremont Factory. While China allowed Tesla to resume production a few weeks later, California did not. Tesla would ultimately defy state orders, and restart production on May 11, 2020.[78]\n\n\nAfter the dispute with California officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas.[79][80] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years significantly expanded its footprint in California. The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in Lathrop, California in 2022,[81] and announced in February 2023 that it would establish a large global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard.[82]\n\n\nTesla became a major investor in bitcoin, acquiring $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency,[83] and on March 24, 2021, the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases.[84] However, after 49 days, the company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of fossil fuels, against the company's mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy.[85] After the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped around 12%.[86] In July 2022 it was reported that Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company's profitability.[87]\n\n\n\n## Automotive products and services[edit]\n\n\n\"Tesla electric car\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Nikola Tesla electric car hoax.\n\nAs of December 2022[update], Tesla offers five vehicle models: Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y, and the Tesla Semi. Tesla's first vehicle, the first-generation Tesla Roadster, is no longer sold. Tesla has plans for a second-generation Roadster and a pickup called the Cybertruck.\n\n\n\n### Available products[edit]\n\n\n#### Model S[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Model S\n\n![](image)Tesla Model S\nThe Model S is a full-size luxury car with a liftback body style and a dual motor, all-wheel drive layout. Development of the Model S began prior to 2007 and deliveries started in June 2012. The Model S has seen two major design refreshes, first in April 2016 which introduced a new front-end design and again in June 2021 which revised the interior. The Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016. Since its introduction, more than 250,000 vehicles have been sold. \n\n\n\n\n#### Model X[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Model X\n\n![](image)Tesla Model X\nThe Model X is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV offered in 5-, 6- and 7-passenger configurations with either a dual- or tri-motor, all-wheel drive layout. The rear passenger doors open vertically with an articulating \"falcon-wing\" design. A prototype Model X was first shown in February 2012 and deliveries started in September 2015.[88] The Model X shares around 30 percent of its content with the Model S. The vehicle has seen one major design refresh in June 2021 which revised the interior. \n\n\n\n\n#### Model 3[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Model 3\n\n![](image)Tesla Model 3\nThe Model 3 is a mid-size car with a fastback body style and either a dual-motor, all-wheel drive layout or a rear-motor, rear-wheel drive layout. The vehicle was designed to be more affordable than the luxury Model S sedan. A prototype Model 3 was first shown in 2016 and within a week the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[52] Deliveries started in July 2017.[89] The Model 3 ranked as the world's bestselling electric car from 2018 to 2021,[90][91][92] and cumulative sales passed 1 million in June 2021.[8] The vehicle has seen one major design refresh in September 2023 which revised the exterior and interior.\n\n\n\n\n#### Model Y[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Model Y\n\n![](image)Tesla Model Y\nThe Model Y is a mid-size crossover SUV offered in 5- and 7-passenger configurations with a dual-motor, all-wheel drive layout. The vehicle was designed to be more affordable than the luxury Model X SUV. A prototype Model Y was first shown in March 2019,[68] and deliveries started in March 2020.[70] The Model Y shared around 75 percent of its content with the Model 3.[69] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y outsold the Toyota Corolla to become the world's best-selling car, the first ever electric vehicle to claim the title.[93]\n\n\n\n\n#### Tesla Semi[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Semi\n\n![](image)Tesla Semi prototypeThe Tesla Semi Class 8 semi-truck by Tesla, Inc. with a tri-motor, rear-wheel drive layout. Tesla claims that the Semi has approximately three times the power of a typical diesel semi truck, a range of 500 miles (800 km).[94] Two prototype trucks were first shown in November 2017 and initial deliveries were made to PepsiCo on December 1, 2022.[95] As of July 2023[update], the truck remains in pilot production,[3] and Tesla does not expect the truck to enter volume production before 2024, due to limited availability of the required 4680 battery cells.[96]\n\n\n### Announced products[edit]\n\n\n#### Cybertruck[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Cybertruck\n\n![](image)Tesla Cybertruck\nThe Cybertruck is a pickup truck unveiled on November 21, 2019.[97] The truck's novel design made of flat sheets of unpainted stainless steel and bulletproof glass windows earned a mixed reception.[98][99][100] As of February 2023, Musk has stated that deliveries are planned to begin by the end of Q3 2023.[101]\n\n\n\n\n#### Roadster (second generation)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Roadster (second generation)\n\n![](image)Tesla Roadster prototype\nOn November 16, 2017, Tesla unveiled the second generation Roadster with a purported range of 620 miles (1,000 km) with a 200 kilowatt-hours (720 MJ) battery pack that would achieve 0–60 miles per hour (0–97 km/h) in 1.9 seconds; and 0–100 mph (0–161 km/h) in 4.2 seconds,[102] and a top speed over 250 mph (400 km/h). A \"SpaceX Package\" would include cold-gas thrusters.[103] The vehicle would have three electric motors, allowing all-wheel drive and torque vectoring during cornering.[103] The base price was set at $200,000.[103] Musk has said that the Roadster should ship in 2024.[104]\n\n\n\n\n#### Tesla next-generation vehicle[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla next-generation vehicle\n\nThe Tesla next-generation vehicle is an announced battery electric platform. It would become the third platform for the company. Vehicles based on this platform are not expected before 2025.[105]\n\n\n\n\n### Discontinued product[edit]\n\n\n#### Tesla Roadster[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Roadster (first generation)\n\n![](image)The original Roadster\nThe original Tesla Roadster[106] was a two-seater sports car, evolved from the Lotus Elise chassis.[107] It was produced from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway-legal serial production electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles (320 km) per charge.\n\n\n\n\n### Connectivity services[edit]\n\n\nTesla cars come with \"Standard Connectivity\", which provides navigation using a cellular connection. For a fee, Tesla offers a subscription to \"Premium Connectivity\" which adds live traffic and satellite maps to navigation, internet browsing, and media streaming.[108]\n\n\n\n### Vehicle servicing[edit]\n\n\nTesla service strategy is to service its vehicles first through remote diagnosis and repair. If it is not possible to resolve a problem remotely, customers are referred to a local Tesla-owned service center, or a mobile technician is dispatched.[109][110] Tesla has said that it does not want to make a profit on vehicle servicing, which has traditionally been a large profit center for most auto dealerships.[111]\n\n\nIn 2016, Tesla recommended having any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: \"your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes,\" and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.[112]\n\n\n\n###  Charging services[edit]\n\n\n####  Supercharger network[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Supercharger\n\nSupercharger is the branding used by Tesla for its high-voltage direct current fast chargers.\n\n\n\n![](image)Tesla Supercharger station in Onalaska, Wisconsin\nThe Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with five sites in California and Nevada. As of January 2024[update], Tesla operates a network of 6,350 Supercharger stations with over 58,000 connectors. The stations are primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,650), North America (over 2,500), and Europe (over 1,200). Since 2019 most superchargers deployed have been able to output as much as 250kW. As of January 2024[update] approximately 68% of chargers have V3 or V4 stalls capable of outputting this amount.\n\n#### Destination charging location network[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\"Destination Charger\" in North America\nTesla also has a network of \"Destination Chargers,\" slower than Superchargers and intended for locations where customers are expected to park and stay for several hours, such as hotels, restaurants, or shopping centers. Unlike the Supercharger network, Tesla does not own the destination chargers, instead, property owners setup the devices and set pricing.[113] When the network first launched in 2014, Tesla provided free charging equipment and covered installation costs.[114] One of the largest providers is hotel chain Hilton Worldwide which in 2023 announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 chargers across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025.[115]\n\n\n\n### Insurance services[edit]\n\n\nTesla has offered its own vehicle insurance in the United States since 2017 and has been acting as an independent insurance producer since 2021 as Tesla Insurance Services, Inc. It was introduced after the American Automobile Association (AAA), a major insurance carrier, raised rates for Tesla owners in June 2017 after a report concluded that the automakers vehicles crashed more often and were more expensive to repair than comparable vehicles.[116] A second study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety confirmed the findings.[117]\n\n\nThe company says that it uniquely understands its vehicles, technology and repair costs, and can eliminate traditional insurance carriers' additional charges.[118] In states where allowed, the company uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing that can increase or decrease in cost based on the prior month's driving safety score.[119] As of 2023, insurance was available in 12 states.[120]\n\n\nAs of January 2023[update], Tesla offers insurance in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia. The company also offers insurance for Tesla vehicle owners with non-Tesla vehicles.[118]\n\n\n\n## Energy products[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Energy\n\n![](image)Two Tesla Powerwall 2 home energy storage devices from Tesla Energy\nTesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy generation systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and services) to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016.[121] In 2022, the company deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 348 megawatts, an increase of 3 megawatts over 2021, and deployed 6.5 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, an increase of 64% over 2021.[122]\n\n\nTesla Energy products include solar panels (built by other companies for Tesla), the Tesla Solar Roof (a solar shingle system) and the Tesla Solar Inverter. Storage products include the Powerwall (a home energy storage device) and the Megapack (a large-scale energy storage system).[123][124][125]\n\n\nFor large-scale customers, Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for automated, real-time power trading, demand forecasting and product control.[126][127][128] In March 2021, the company said its online products were managing over 1.2 GWh of storage.[129] For home customers, the company operates a virtual power company in Texas called Tesla Electric, which utilizes the company's online platforms to manage customers Powerwall devices, discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high, earning money for customers.[130][131]\n\n\n\n## Business strategy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robotic manufacturing of the Model S at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California\nAt the time of Tesla's founding in 2003, electric vehicles were very expensive.[132] In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla's strategy was to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price. This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars.[21][133] Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-volume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The most recent models, the Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market,[134][135] selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter. Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year, as opposed to nearly every other car manufacturer.[136]\n\n\nUnlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell vehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores.[137][138] The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers.[139][140] Some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls *galleries* that the company says \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[141][142] In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries.[143] These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas,[138] instead of near other auto dealerships.[144][145][146]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Tesla Patent Wall at its headquarters was removed after the company announced its patents are part of the open source movement.[147]\nAnalysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically *outsource* 80% of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.[149][150][151]\n\n\nTesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the world's use of sustainable energy.[152] Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[153] Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.[154]\n\n\n\n## Technology[edit]\n\n\nTesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148]\n\n\n\n### Batteries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tesla vehicle chassis used in Model S and X, with the battery visible\n![](image)Comparison of Tesla's three cylindrical battery cell form factors\nAs of 2023, Tesla uses four different battery cell form factors: 18650, 2170, 4680, and prismatic.[155][156][157]\n\n\nTesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers, CATL, LG Energy Solution, and Panasonic, the latter of which has co-located some of its battery production inside Tesla's Gigafactory Nevada. Tesla is also currently building out the capacity to produce its own batteries.\n\n\nTesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space. Tesla uses a multi-part aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from road debris and/or vehicle crashes.[158]\n\n\nBusiness analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla's battery pack cost in 2021 at $112 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), versus an industry average of $132 per kWh.[159]\n\n\n\n#### 18650[edit]\n\n\nTesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical, lithium-ion battery cells. When it built the first generation Roadster, it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18 mm diameter, 65 mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge, requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention chemical.[160] However, the decision proved to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest technology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic's factories in Japan.[161]\n\n\n\n#### 2170[edit]\n\n\nThe next battery type to be used was 2170-type (21 mm diameter, 70 mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170 was introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles.[161]\n\n\nFor vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic's production line at Gigafactory Nevada.[162] In January 2021, Panasonic had the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there.[163] Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product.\n\n\nFor vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg batteries with a nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC) cathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution's factories in China.[161]\n\n\n\n#### 4680[edit]\n\n\nTesla's latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680-type (46 mm diameter, 80 mm height) introduced in 2021. The battery was developed in-house by Tesla and is physically 5-times bigger than the 2170-type, again allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack.[164][165] Currently, Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed the cathode chemistry. The company has already opened production lines in Fremont, California, and plans to open lines inside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas. The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at Gigafactory Texas.[161]\n\n\n\n#### Prismatic[edit]\n\n\nTesla also uses prismatic (rectangular) cells in many entry-level Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.[161] The prismatic cells are a lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP or LiFePO  \n4) which is a less energy-dense type, but do not contain any nickel or cobalt, which makes it less expensive to produce.[166] Tesla sources these batteries from CATL's factories in China. As of April 2022[update], nearly half of Tesla's vehicle production used prismatic cells.[167] Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its Megapack grid-scale energy storage product.[168]\n\n\n\n#### Research[edit]\n\n\nTesla invests in lithium-ion battery research. In 2016, the company established a 5-year battery research and development partnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, with lead researcher Jeff Dahn.[169][170][171][172] Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies for over $200 million[173] – and sold in 2021.[174] It also acquired Hibar Systems.[175][176] Tesla purchased several battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International, a small Canadian battery company.[177][178]\n\n\n\n### Software[edit]\n\n\nTesla uses over-the-air updates to deliver updates to vehicles, adding features or fixing problems.[179] This is enabled by tight integration between a few powerful onboard computers, compared to the way automakers had previously handled technology, by purchasing off-the-shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the software level.[180]\n\n\nThe system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to. For example, for ease of assembly all Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats, but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn them on. However, Tesla has allowed customers who didn't pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear seats.[181] Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full-Self Driving features, even though all vehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features.[182]\n\n\n\n### Motors[edit]\n\n\nTesla makes two kinds of electric motors. Its oldest design in production is a three-phase four-pole alternating current induction motor (asynchronous motor) with a copper rotor[183] (which inspired the Tesla logo). These motors use electromagnetic induction, by varying magnetic field to produce torque. Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model 3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster.\n\n\nNewer, higher efficiency permanent magnet motors have been in use since the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017. They are currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y, the front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi.[184] The permanent magnet motors are more efficient, especially in stop-start driving.[185]\n\n\n\n###  North American Charging Standard[edit]\n\n\nMain article: North American Charging Standard\n\nThe North American Charging Standard (NACS) is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla. It has been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since 2012 and was opened for use to other manufacturers in 2022. Since then, nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from 2025, their electric vehicles sold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port. Several electric vehicle charging network operators and equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors.[186]\n\n\n\n### Autopilot[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Autopilot\n\n![](image)Tesla Autopilot in operation\nAutopilot is an advanced driver-assistance system developed by Tesla. The system requires active driver supervision at all times.[187]\n\n\nSince September 2014, all Tesla cars are shipped with sensors (initially hardware version 1 or \"HW1\") and software to support Autopilot.[188] Tesla upgraded its sensors and software in October 2016 (\"HW2\") to support full self-driving in the future.[189] HW2 includes eight cameras, twelve ultrasonic sensors, and forward-facing radar.[189] HW2.5 was released in mid-2017, and it upgraded HW2 with a second graphics processing unit (GPU) and, for the Model 3 only, a driver-facing camera.[190] HW3 was released in early 2019 with an updated and more powerful computer, employing a custom Tesla-designed system on a chip.[191]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Tesla announced that all of its cars will include Autopilot software (defined as just *Traffic-Aware Cruise Control* and *Autosteer* (Beta)) as a standard feature moving forward.[192] Full self-driving software (Autopark, Navigate on Autopilot (Beta), Auto Lane Change (Beta), Summon (Beta), Smart Summon (Beta) and future abilities) is an extra cost option.[192]\n\n\nIn 2020, Tesla released software updates where its cars recognize and automatically stop at stop signs and traffic lights.[193][194][195] In May 2021, Tesla removed the radar sensor and radar features from its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, opting instead to rely on camera vision alone.[196][197][198] The *New York Times* reported in December 2021 that Musk \"repeatedly told members of the Autopilot team that humans could drive with only two eyes and that this meant cars should be able to drive with cameras alone,\" an analogy some experts and former Tesla engineers described as \"deeply flawed.\"[199] Similarly, a statistical analysis conducted in *A Methodology for Normalizing Safety Statistics of Partially Automated Vehicles* debunked a common Tesla claim that Autopilot reduced crash rates by 40 percent[200] by accounting for the relative safety of the given operating domain when using active safety measures.[201]\n\n\n\n### Full Self-Driving[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Autopilot § Full Self-Driving\n\n*Full Self-Driving* (FSD) is an optional extension of Autopilot promoted as eventually being able to perform fully autonomous driving. At the end of 2016, Tesla expected to demonstrate full autonomy by the end of 2017,[202] which as of July 2022[update] has not occurred.[203] The first beta version of the software was released on October 22, 2020, to a small group of testers.[204] The release of the beta has renewed concern regarding whether the technology is ready for testing on public roads.[205][206] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has called for \"tougher requirements\" for any testing of Autopilot on public roads.[207]\n\n\nTesla's approach to achieve full autonomy is different from that of other companies.[208] Whereas Waymo, Cruise, and other companies are relying on highly detailed (centimeter-scale) three-dimensional maps, lidar, and cameras, as well as radar and ultrasonic sensors in their autonomous vehicles, Tesla's approach is to use coarse-grained two-dimensional maps and cameras (no lidar) as well as radar and ultrasonic sensors.[208][209] Tesla claims that although its approach is much more difficult, it will ultimately be more useful, because its vehicles will be able to self-drive without geofencing concerns.[210] Tesla's self-driving software has been trained on over 20 billion miles driven by Tesla vehicles as of January 2021.[211] Tesla also designed a self-driving computer chip that has been installed in its cars since March 2019.[212]\n\n\nMost experts believe that Tesla's approach of trying to achieve full self-driving by eschewing lidar and high-definition maps is not feasible.[213][214][215] In March 2021, according to a letter that Tesla sent to the California Department of Motor Vehicles about FSD's capability – acquired by PlainSite via a public records request – Tesla stated that FSD is not capable of autonomous driving and is only at Society of Automotive Engineers Level 2 automation.[216] In a May 2021 study by Guidehouse Insights, Tesla was ranked last for both strategy and execution in the autonomous driving sector.[217] In October 2021, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) called on Tesla to change the design of its Autopilot to ensure it cannot be misused by drivers, according to a letter sent to Musk.[218]\n\n\n\n### Robotics[edit]\n\n\nAhead of the start of production of the Model 3, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble vehicles. To that end, between 2015 and 2017, the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including Compass Automation,[219] Grohmann Automation,[220] Perbix Machine Company, and Riviera Tool and Die.[221] Elon Musk later admitted that the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[53]\n\n\nTesla uses massive casting machines (Giga Press) to make large single pieces of vehicle underbodies and to streamline production.[222] This saves time, labor, cost and factory space, replacing multiple robots that weld car parts together with a single machine.[223]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Tesla revealed prototypes of a humanoid robot named Optimus, which Musk has stated uses the same core software as FSD. During the presentations at Tesla's AI Day 2022, Musk suggested that, among other use cases, the finalized version of Optimus could be used in Tesla's car factories to help with repetitive tasks and relieve labor shortages.[224]\n\n\nIn July 2023, Tesla acquired Wiferion, a Germany-based developer of wireless charging systems for industrial vehicles and autonomous robots, which has since been operating as Tesla Engineering Germany GmbH.[225] Tesla sold the business to Munich-based Puls Group three months later, but retained its staff.[226][227]\n\n\n\n### Glass[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2016, the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof's solar shingles.[228]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Tesla factories\n\nThe company operates seven large factories and about a dozen smaller factories around the world. As of 2023[update], the company also operates more than 1,000 retail stores, galleries, service, delivery and body shop locations globally.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary facilities operated by Tesla\n| Opened\n | Name\n | City\n | Country\n | Employees\n | Products\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010\n | Tesla Fremont Factory | Fremont, California | United States\n | 22,000\n | Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y | [35][229][230] |\n| 2016\n | Gigafactory Nevada | Storey County, Nevada | United States\n | 7,000\n | Batteries, Powerwall, Semi | [231][232][233] |\n| 2017\n | Gigafactory New York | Buffalo, New York | United States\n | 1,500\n | Solar Roof, Supercharger | [234][235] |\n| 2019\n | Gigafactory Shanghai | Shanghai | China\n | 20,000\n | Model 3, Model Y, Supercharger\n | [236][237] |\n| 2022\n | Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg | Grünheide | Germany\n | 10,000\n | Model Y *(planned: batteries, Model 3)* | [238][239][240] |\n| 2022\n | Gigafactory Texas | Austin, Texas | United States\n | 12,000\n | Model Y *(planned: batteries, Cybertruck, Next-gen vehicle)* | [241][242][243] |\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tesla Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory New York, Gigafactory Texas, and Gigafactory Mexico\n\n![](image)New Tesla Model S cars at the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2012\nTesla was founded in San Carlos, California.[244] In 2010, Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto.[245] Tesla's first retail store was opened in 2008 in Los Angeles.[246]\n\n\nTesla's first assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, known as the Tesla Fremont Factory. The factory was originally opened by General Motors in 1962, and then operated by NUMMI, a joint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984.[247] The joint venture ended when GM entered bankruptcy in 2009. In 2010, Toyota agreed to sell the plant to Tesla at a significant discount.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gigafactory Nevada in 2019\n![](image)Gigafactory Texas in 2022\nTesla's first purpose-built facility was opened in Nevada in 2016. Gigafactory Nevada produces Powerwalls, Powerpacks and Megapacks;[231] battery cells in partnership with Panasonic;[248] and Model 3 drivetrains.[249] The factory received substantial subsidies (abatements and credits) from the local and state government, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla to operate essentially tax free for 10 years.[250]\n\n\nAs part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla gained control of Gigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant. The state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the Buffalo Billion program.[251][252] In 2017, the factory started production of the Tesla Solar Roof,[234] but faced multiple production challenges. Since 2020, Tesla has also assembled Superchargers in New York. The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state funding.[253]\n\n\nOn July 23, 2020, Tesla picked Austin, Texas, as the site of its fifth Gigafactory, since then known as Gigafactory Texas.[254] Giga Texas is planned to be the main factory for the Tesla Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi; it will also produce Model 3 and Model Y cars for the Eastern United States.[255][242] On April 7, 2022, Tesla celebrated the opening of the facility in a public event.[76]\n\n\nOn December 1, 2021, Tesla relocated its legal headquarters from Palo Alto, California, to the Gigafactory site in Austin, Texas.[256]\n\n\nTesla acquired a former JC Penney distribution center near Lathrop, California, in 2021 to build the \"Megafactory\" to manufacture the Megapack, the company's large scale energy storage product.[257][258] The location opened in 2022.\n\n\nTesla announced in February it would open a new global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard, located a couple of miles from Tesla's former headquarters.\n\n\nTesla plans to open Gigafactory Mexico, the company's sixth Gigafactory near Monterrey, Mexico in 2025.\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tesla facilities in Tilburg and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg\n\n![](image)Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg under construction in October 2021\nTesla opened its first European store in June 2009 in London.[259] Tesla's European headquarters are in the Netherlands,[260] part of a group of Tesla facilities in Tilburg, including the company's European Distribution Centre.[261]\n\n\nIn late 2016, Tesla acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering as a new division dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process.[262] After winding down existing contracts with other manufacturers, the renamed Tesla Automation now works exclusively on Tesla projects.[263]\n\n\nTesla announced its plans to build a car and battery factory in Europe in 2016.[264] Several countries campaigned to be the host,[265] and eventually Germany was chosen in November 2019.[266] On March 22, 2022, Tesla's first European Gigafactory named Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg[267][268] opened with planned capacity to produce 500,000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars.[268]\n\n\n\n### Asia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gigafactory Shanghai\n\n![](image)Tesla store in Tokyo, the first in Asia[269]\nTesla opened its first showroom in Asia in Tokyo, Japan, in October 2010.[270]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Tesla signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a factory in Shanghai, China, which was Tesla's first Gigafactory outside of the United States.[271] The factory building was finished in August 2019, and the initial Tesla Model 3s were in production from Gigafactory Shanghai in October 2019.[236] In 2021, China accounted for 26% of Tesla sales revenue, and was the second largest market for Tesla after the United States, which accounted for 45% of its sales.[272]\n\n\nTesla has expressed interest in expanding to India and perhaps building a future Gigafactory in the country.[273] The company established a legal presence in the nation in 2021 and plans to open an office in Pune starting in October 2023.[274]\n\n\n\n## Partners[edit]\n\n\n### Panasonic[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Panasonic Energy president Naoto Noguchi, presents Tesla executive JB Straubel, with lithium-ion cells\nIn January 2010, Tesla and battery cell maker Panasonic announced that they would together develop nickel-based lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles.[275] The partnership was part of Panasonic's $1 billion investment over three years in facilities for lithium-ion cell research, development and production.[276]\n\n\nBeginning in 2010, Panasonic invested $30 million for a multi-year collaboration on new battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles.[277] In July 2014, Panasonic reached a basic agreement with Tesla to participate in battery production at Giga Nevada.[278]\n\n\nTesla and Panasonic also collaborated on the manufacturing and production of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules at the Giga New York factory in Buffalo, New York.[234] The partnership started in mid-2017 and ended in early 2020, before Panasonic exited the solar business entirely in January 2021.[279][280]\n\n\nIn March 2021, the outgoing CEO of Panasonic stated that the company plans to reduce its reliance on Tesla as their battery partnership evolves.[281]\n\n\n\n### Other current partners[edit]\n\n\nTesla has long-term contracts in place for lithium supply. In September 2020, Tesla signed a sales agreement with Piedmont Lithium to buy high-purity lithium ore for up to ten years,[282] specifically to supply \"spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's North Carolina mineral deposit\".[283] In 2022, Tesla contracted for 110,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate over four years from the Core Lithium's lithium mine in the Northern Territory of Australia.[284]\n\n\nTesla also has a range of minor partnerships, for instance working with Airbnb and hotel chains to install destination chargers at selected locations.[285]\n\n\n\n### Former partners[edit]\n\n\n#### Daimler[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive used a Tesla-supplied battery pack.[286]\nDaimler and Tesla began working together in late 2007. On May 19, 2009, Daimler bought a stake of less than 10% in Tesla for a reported $50 million.[287][288] As part of the collaboration, Herbert Kohler, vice-president of E-Drive and Future Mobility at Daimler, took a Tesla board seat.[289] On July 13, 2009, Daimler sold 40% of its acquisition to Aabar, an investment company controlled by the International Petroleum Investment Company owned by the government of Abu Dhabi.[290] In October 2014, Daimler sold its remaining holdings for a reported $780 million.[291]\n\n\nTesla supplied battery packs for Freightliner Trucks in 2010.[292][293] The company also built electric-powertrain components for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-Cell, with 500 cars planned to be built for trial in Europe beginning in September 2011.[294][295] Tesla produced and co-developed the Mercedes-Benz B250e's powertrain, which ended production in 2017.[296] The electric motor was rated 134 hp (100 kW) and 230 pound force-feet (310 N⋅m), with a 36 kWh (130 MJ) battery. The vehicle had a driving range of 200 km (124 mi) with a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph).[297] Daimler division Smart produced the Smart ED2 cars from 2009 to 2012 which had a 14-kilowatt-hour (50 MJ) lithium-ion battery from Tesla.[298][299]\n\n\n\n#### Toyota[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toyota RAV4 EV, which used a Tesla-supplied battery and powertrain components\nIn May 2010, Tesla and Toyota announced a deal in which Tesla purchased the former NUMMI factory from Toyota for $42 million, Toyota purchased $50 million in Tesla stock, and the two companies collaborated on an electric vehicle.[35]\n\n\nIn July 2010, the companies announced they would work together on a second generation Toyota RAV4 EV.[300] The vehicle was unveiled at the October 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show and 35 pilot vehicles were built for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. Tesla supplied the lithium metal-oxide battery and other powertrain components[301][302] based on components from the Roadster.[303]\n\n\nThe production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from the Tesla Model S sedan (also launched in 2012).[304] The RAV4 EV had a limited production run which resulted in just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.[305][306]\n\n\nAccording to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was \"marred by clashes between engineers\".[307] Toyota engineers rejected designs that Tesla had proposed for an enclosure to protect the RAV4 EV's battery pack. Toyota took over responsibility for the enclosure's design and strengthened it. In 2014, Tesla ended up adding a titanium plate to protect the Model S sedan's battery after some debris-related crashes lead to cars catching fire.[307][158] On June 5, 2017, Toyota announced that it had sold all of its shares in Tesla and halted the partnership.[308][309]\n\n\n\n#### Mobileye[edit]\n\n\nInitial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with Mobileye beginning in 2014.[310] Mobileye ended the partnership on July 26, 2016, citing \"disagreements about how the technology was deployed.\"[311]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc. and Criticism of Tesla, Inc.\n\n### Sexual harassment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at Tesla's Fremont factory.[312] They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment. The women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, unwanted touching, and discrimination while at work. \"I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief,\" Brooks told *The Washington Post*. \"That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job.\" Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex.[313]\n\n\nWomen feared calling Human Resources for help as their supervisors were often participants.[314] Musk himself is not indicted, but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. They cite his crude remarks about women's bodies, wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to \"T.IT.S\", and his generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment.[315] \"What we're addressing for each of the lawsuits is just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla,\" said attorney David A. Lowe.[314] In 2017, another woman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired. In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired her, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee's allegations with the help of \"a neutral, third-party expert\" and concluded her complaints were unmerited.[316]\n\n\nIn May 2022, a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court, rejecting Tesla's request for closed-door arbitration.[317]\n\n\n\n### Labor disputes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tesla and unions\n\nIn June 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) took issue with Tesla's use of nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) regarding customer repairs[318] and, in October 2021, the NHTSA formally asked Tesla to explain its NDA policy regarding customers invited into the FSD Beta.[319] Tesla has used NDAs on multiple occasions with both employees[320] and customers[321] to allegedly prevent possible negative coverage.[322][323]\n\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Tesla's Fremont Factory had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations as the ten largest U.S. auto plants combined.[324] An investigation by the Reveal podcast alleged that Tesla \"failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports\" to downplay the extent of injuries.[325]\n\n\nIn January 2019, former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company had hacked employees' phones and spied on them, while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and shareholders.[326][327][328] Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla. These include the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez[329][330] and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen.[331] In 2020, the court ordered Hansen's case to arbitration.[332] In June 2022, the arbitrator filed an unopposed motion with the court stating Hansen \"has failed to establish the claims...Accordingly his claims are denied, and he shall take nothing\".[333]\n\n\nIn September 2019, a California judge ruled that 12 actions in 2017 and 2018 by Musk and other Tesla executives violated labor laws because they sabotaged employee attempts to unionize.[334][335]\n\n\nIn March 2021, the US National Labor Relations Board ordered Musk to remove a tweet and reinstate a fired employee over union organization activities.[336][337] Later, after appealing, a federal appeals court upheld the decision.[338]\n\n\nThe California Civil Rights Department filed a suit in 2022 alleging \"a pattern of racial harassment and bias\" at the Tesla Fremont factory. As of April 2023,[update] the department is also conducting a probe of the factory based on a 2021 complaint and claims that Tesla has been obstructing the investigation.[339]\n\n\n\n### Fraud allegations[edit]\n\n\nThere have been numerous concerns about Tesla's financial reporting. In 2013, *Bloomberg News* questioned whether Tesla's financial reporting violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) reporting standards.[340] *Fortune* accused Tesla in 2016 of using creative accounting to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits.[341] In 2018, analysts expressed concerns over Tesla's accounts receivable balance.[342] In September 2019, the SEC questioned Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn about Tesla's warranty reserves and lease accounting.[343] In a letter to his clients, hedge fund manager David Einhorn, whose firm suffered losses from its short position against Tesla that quarter, accused Elon Musk in November 2019 of \"significant fraud\",[344][345] and publicly questioned Tesla's accounting practices, telling Musk that he was \"beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist.\"[346]\n\n\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than $295 million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a battery-swapping technology that was never made available to customers.[347] Staff at California Air Resources Board were concerned that Tesla was \"gaming\" the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits.[348]\n\n\nA consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition, that he and the Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the deal, and failed to disclose \"troubling facts\" essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition.[349] The members of the board settled in 2020, leaving Musk as the only defendant.[350] In April 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in favor of Musk,[351][352] and its ruling was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in June 2023.[353]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\"[354] The tweet caused the stock to initially rise but then drop when it was revealed to be false.[355][356][357] Musk settled fraud charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his false statements in September 2018. According to the terms of the settlement, Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla's in-house counsel, he was removed from his chairman role at Tesla temporarily, and two new independent directors were appointed to the company's board.[358] Tesla and Musk also paid civil penalties of $20 million each.[358] A civil class-action shareholder lawsuit over Musk's statements and other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors, as then constituted, in regard to claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private.[359][360] In February 2023, a California jury unanimously found Musk and Tesla not liable in the class-action lawsuit.[361]\n\n\nIn September 2018, Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding its Model 3 production figures.[362] Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and made projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet.[362] A stockholder class action lawsuit against Tesla related to Model 3 production numbers (unrelated to the FBI investigation) was dismissed in March 2019.[363][364]\n\n\n\n### Tesla US dealership disputes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tesla US dealership disputes\n\nUnlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles and instead directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. In some areas, Tesla operates locations called \"galleries\" which \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[141] This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete with each other, lowering the price a customer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their own dealers.[144] The United States Federal Trade Commission ultimately disproved the associations' claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[365][366][367]\n\n\nTesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars.[368] The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles,[141] because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gas-powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since properly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas-powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to dealership EV sales.[144] Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles because they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after-sales service revenue, a large profit center for most dealerships.[111]\n\n\n\n### Intellectual property[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Alex Khatilov alleging that the former employee stole company information by downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his personal Dropbox account.[369] Khatilov denies the allegation that he was acting as a \"willful and malicious thief\" and attributes his actions to an accidental data transfer.[370] The case was settled in August 2021 through mediation.[371]\n\n\nTesla has sued former employees in the past for similar actions, including those who left to work for a rival such as XPeng and Zoox;[372] for example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading Tesla Autopilot source code to his iCloud account;[373] Tesla and Cao settled in April 2021, in which Cao was ordered to monetarily compensate Tesla.[374]\n\n\n\n### Misappropriation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by approving Musk's stock-based compensation plan.[360] Musk received the first portion of his stock options payout, worth more than $700 million in May 2020.[375]\n\n\nIn July 2023, Tesla board members returned $735 million to the company to settle a claim from a 2020 lawsuit alleging misappropriation of 11 million stock options granted to Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Larry Ellison, and others from 2017 to 2020.[376]\n\n\n\n### Environmental violations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, The United States Environmental Protection Agency fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in 2017.[377] In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District;[378] the violations took place around Tesla Fremont's paint shop, where there had been at least four fires between 2014 and 2019.[379] Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla's Fremont Factory increased from 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3.[380]\n\n\nIn June 2018, Tesla employee Martin Tripp leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40% of its raw materials at the Nevada Gigafactory.[381] After Tesla fired him for the leak, Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Tesla's security team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory.[382][326] The court ruled in Tesla's favor on September 17, 2020.[383][384]\n\n\n\n### Property damage[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Walmart filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that Tesla's \"negligent installation and maintenance\" of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012.[385] Walmart reached a settlement with Tesla in November 2019; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[386]\n\n\nIn May 2021, a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 over-the-air software update, awarding each of the 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit 136,000 Norwegian kroner ($16,000).[387]\n\n\n\n### Racism[edit]\n\n\nTesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination,[388][389] with one former Tesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as \"a hotbed of racist behavior\".[390] As of December 2021, three percent of leadership at the company are African American.[391] A former black worker described the work environment at Tesla's Buffalo plant as a \"very racist place\".[392] Tesla and SpaceX's treatment of Juneteenth in 2020 also came under fire.[393] Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that Tesla discriminates specifically against African Americans and \"allows a racist environment in its factories.\"[394] According to the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place where Black employees claim they are given the most menial[395] and physically demanding work.[396] The accusations of racism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for \"discriminating against its Black workers.\"[397]\n\n\nIn July 2021, former employee Melvin Berry received $1 million in his discrimination case in arbitration against Tesla after he claimed he was referred to by the n-word and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant.[398]\n\n\nIn October 2021, a jury verdict in the *Owen Diaz vs. Tesla* trial awarded the plaintiff $137 million in damages after he had faced racial harassment at Tesla's Fremont facility during 2015–2016.[399][400] In a blog, Tesla stressed that Diaz was never \"really\" a Tesla worker, and that most utterings of the n-word were expressed in a friendly manner.[401][402] In April 2022, federal judge William Orrick upheld the jury finding of Tesla's liability but reduced the total damage down to $15 million.[403] Diaz was given a two-week deadline to decide if he would collect the damages. In June 2022, Diaz announced that he would be rejecting the $15 million award, opening the door for a new trial.[404] In April 2023, Diaz was awarded $3.2 million in the new trial.[405]\n\n\nFew of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements.[406] Employees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court, and behind closed doors.\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nTesla's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been the subject of considerable criticism. Musk had sought to exempt the Tesla Fremont factory in Alameda County, California from the government's stay-at-home orders. In an earnings call in April, he was heard calling the public health orders \"fascist\".[407] He had also called the public's response to the pandemic \"dumb\" and had said online that there would be zero cases by April.[408] In May 2020, while Alameda County officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont Factory on the 18th, Musk defied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th.[409][410][78] Tesla also sued Alameda County, questioning the legality of the orders, but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen.[411][412] In June 2020, Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe,[413] however some employees still expressed concern for their health.[414]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work.[415] But in June, Tesla fired an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers from the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory.[416] Three more employees at Tesla's Fremont Factory claimed they were fired for staying home out of fear of catching COVID-19. This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the employees were still on the payroll.[417] COVID-19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December 2020, with about 450 total cases in that time period out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant (4.5%).[407][418]\n\n\nIn China, Tesla had what one executive described as \"not a green light from the government to get back to work – but a flashing-sirens police escort.\"[419] Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China, including tax breaks, cheap financing, and assistance in building its Giga Shanghai factory at breakneck speeds.[419] Musk has praised China's way of doing things, a controversial stance due to deteriorating U.S.–Chinese relations, China's ongoing persecution of Uyghurs, and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong.[419]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Criticism of Tesla, Inc.\n\n### Data privacy[edit]\n\n\nTesla was only the second product ever reviewed by Mozilla foundation which ticked all of their privacy concerns.[420][421]\n\n\nA Tesla owner filed a lawsuit in 2023 following a Reuters report that Tesla employees shared \"highly invasive videos and images recorded by customers' car cameras\" with one another.[422]\n\n\n\n### Short sellers[edit]\n\n\nTSLAQ is a collective of Tesla critics and short sellers who aim to \"shape [the] perception [of Tesla] and move its stock.\"[423] In January 2020, 20% of Tesla stock was shorted, the highest at that time of any stock in the U.S. equity markets.[424] By early 2021, according to CNN, short sellers had lost $40 billion during 2020 as the stock price climbed much higher.[425] Michael Burry, a short seller portrayed in *The Big Short*, had shorted Tesla previously via his firm Scion Asset Management, but removed his position in October 2021.[426]\n\n\n\n### Tesla's mission[edit]\n\n\nAccording to automotive journalist Jamie Kitman, when multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers approached Tesla for EV technology that Musk had claimed the company was willing to share, they instead were offered the opportunity to buy regulatory credits from Tesla. This suggested, according to Kitman, that \"the company may not be as eager for the electric revolution to occur as it claims.\"[427]\n\n\n\n### Giga New York audit[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, the New York State Comptroller released an audit of the Giga New York factory project, concluding that it presented many red flags, including lack of basic due diligence and that the factory itself produced only $0.54 in economic benefits for every $1 spent by the state.[428][429][430]\n\n\n\n### Delays[edit]\n\n\nMusk has been criticized for repeated pushing out both production and release dates of products.[431][432] By one count in 2016, Musk had missed 20 projections.[433] In October 2017, Musk predicted that Model 3 production would be 5,000 units per week by December.[434] A month later, he revised that target to \"sometime in March\" 2018.[435] Delivery dates for the Model 3 were delayed as well.[436] Other projects like converting supercharger stations to be solar-powered have also lagged projections.[437] Musk responded in late 2018: \"punctuality is not my strong suit...I never made a mass-produced car. How am I supposed to know with precision when it's gonna get done?\"[438]\n\n\n\n## Vehicle product issues[edit]\n\n\n### Recalls[edit]\n\n\nOn April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and \"prevent the vehicles from moving\".[439][440] On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to corrosion-susceptible power steering bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use \"increased force\" to control the vehicle.[441]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50,000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China for suspension issues.[442] Soon after in November, the NHTSA announced it had opened its own investigation into 115,000 Tesla cars regarding \"front suspension safety issues\", citing specifically 2015–2017 Model S and 2016–2017 Model X years. Cases of the \"whompy wheel\" phenomenon, which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars, have been documented through 2020.[443][444]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Tesla was required by the NHTSA to recall 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles built from 2012 to 2018 due to using a flash memory device that was rated to last only 5 to 6 years.[445] The problem was related to touchscreen failures that could possibly affect the rear-view camera, safety systems, Autopilot and other features.[446][447] The underlying technical reason is that the car writes a large amount of syslog content to the device, wearing it out prematurely.[448]\n\n\nAlso in February 2021, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) ordered Tesla to recall 12,300 Model X cars because of \"body mouldings problems\".[449][450]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Tesla recalled 5,974 electric vehicles due to worries that brake caliper bolts might become loose, which could lead to loss of tire pressure, potentially increasing the chance of a crash.[451]\n\n\nOn December 30, 2021, Tesla announced that they are recalling more than 475,000 US model vehicles. This included 356,309 Model 3 Tesla vehicles from 2017 to 2020 due to rear-view camera issues and a further 119,009 Tesla Model S vehicles due to potential problems with the trunk or boot. The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2021. Around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera, and around 14% of recalled model S' may have the defect. The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the Passenger Play feature, which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion.[452] After an investigation was launched by the NHTSA covering 585,000 vehicles, Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and unusable while the car is moving.[453]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 1.1 million US model vehicles because the automatic window reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury.[454][455] In response, Tesla announced an over-the-air software fix.[455]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Tesla recalled its FSD software following a recommendation from NHTSA; the recall applied to approximately 360,000 cars.[456] NHTSA found that FSD caused \"unreasonable risk\" when used on city streets.[457] In March 2023, about 3,500 Model Y Teslas were recalled for a bolting issue concerning the cars' second-row seats.[458]\n\n\n\n### Fires[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents § Tesla\n\nTesla customers have reported the company as being \"slow\" to address how their cars can ignite.[459] In 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object.[460] As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[461] In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection to its battery packs.[462] All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[463] In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an investigation into possible battery defects in Tesla's Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause \"non-crash\" fires.[464][465][466]\n\n\n\n### Autopilot crashes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tesla Autopilot § Fatal crashes\n\nA Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot.[467][468] The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safety-related defect trend.[469] In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash. Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in 'self-driving' mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.[470]\n\n\nAccording to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities.[471][472] In early September 2021, the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident[473] and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-responder vehicles.[473][474][475] In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect emergency lights at night.[476] In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it did not issue a recall when it sent out that update.[477] In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla models. The probe will be moved up from the *Preliminary Evaluation* level to the *Engineering Analysis* one. The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to \"explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver's supervision.\"[478]\n\n\nA safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[479] but there has been controversy over its conclusions.[480] Several Tesla fans responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice.[481]\n\n\n\n### Software hacking[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car's entertainment system.[482] The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[483] Tesla issued a security update for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.[484]\n\n\nIn September 2016, researchers at Tencent's Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[485] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.[486] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[487]\n\n\nIn January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[488][489] Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event.[490]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier to start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their own keys to a vehicle.[491]\n\n\n\n### Phantom braking[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2022, Tesla drivers have reported a surge in \"phantom braking\" events when using Tesla Autopilot which coincides with the automaker's removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021.[492] In response, NHTSA has opened an investigation.[493]\n\n\nIn May 2023, German business newspaper *Handelsblatt* published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla data submitted to them from informants.[494] The 100 gigabytes of data \"contain[ed] over 1,000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration\" as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot.[495] Dutch authorities responded by saying they were investigating the company for possible data privacy violations.[496]\n\n\n\n### Driving range performance[edit]\n\n\nTesla has received thousands of complaints from owners that the driving ranges of their vehicles did not meet the ranges advertised by Tesla or the projections of in-dash range meters. When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments to take care of these issues, Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible. Customers were told that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem and their appointments were canceled.

There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\nTesla financial performance\n\nFor the fiscal (and calendar) year 2021, Tesla reported a net income of $5.52 billion.[10] The annual revenue was $53.8 billion, an increase of 71% over the previous fiscal year.[10]\n\n\nOf the revenue number in 2021, $314 million came from selling regulatory credits to other automakers to meet government pollution standards. That number has been a smaller percentage of revenue for multiple quarters.[10]\n\n\nTesla ended 2021 with $17.6 billion of cash on hand, down $1.8 billion from the end of 2020.[141]: 31\n\n\nIn February 2021, a 10-K filing revealed that Tesla had invested some $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and the company indicated it would soon accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.[83] Critics then pointed out how investing in cryptocurrency can run counter to Tesla's environmental goals.[503][504] Tesla made more profit from the 2021 investment than the profit from selling cars in 2020, due to the Bitcoin price increase after the investment was announced.[505][506]\n\n\nThe quarter ending June 2021 was the first time Tesla made a profit independent of Bitcoin and regulatory credits.[507]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenue(mil.

Robyn Denholm (since November 2018)[512]\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nTesla has received criticism that its board lacks enough independent directors. In an April 2017 public letter, a group of influential Tesla investors, including the California State Teachers' Retirement System, asked Tesla to add two new independent directors to its board \"who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk\".[514] The investors wrote that \"five of six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement.\"[515] Tesla's directors at the time included Brad Buss, who served as chief financial officer at SolarCity; Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who also sits on the board of SpaceX;[516] Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal; and Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias, both of whom also invested in SpaceX.[517] The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on groupthink.[515] At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the investors \"should buy Ford stock\" because \"their governance is amazing.\"[515] Two days later, he promised he would add two independent board members;[518] Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Larry Ellison were added at the end of 2018.[519] Ellison stepped down in August 2022.[520] Former Tesla CTO J. B. Straubel who left the company in 2019, was elected to the board in 2023.[521]\n\n\nAnother criticism of the board composition is that most of the independent directors lack automotive industry experience.[522] The exception is Robyn Denholm who served in finance and corporate reporting roles at Toyota Australia from 1989 to 1996.[523]\n\n\nOther previous board members include businessman Steve Westly; Daimler executive Herbert Kohler;[289] CEO and Chairman of Johnson Publishing Company Linda Johnson Rice;[524] and United Nations Special Envoy on Innovative Finance and Sustainable Investments Hiromichi Mizuno.[525][526]\n\n\nAs of May 2023[update], the board members are:[527]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Joined\n | Name\n | Titles\n | Independent |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014[528] | Robyn Denholm | Chair (since November 2018); former CFO and Head of Strategy of Telstra[523] | Yes\n |\n| 2004[18] | Elon Musk | CEO, product architect, former chairman; founder, CEO and CTO of SpaceX\n | No\n |\n| 2004[529] | Kimbal Musk | SpaceX board member[530] | No\n |\n| 2007[531] | Ira Ehrenpreis\n | General Partner at Technology Partners[524] | Disputed[514] |\n| 2017[524] | James Murdoch | Former CEO of 21st Century Fox[524] | Yes\n |\n| 2018[516] | Kathleen Wilson-Thompson | Global head of Human Resources of Walgreens Boots Alliance[516] | Yes\n |\n| 2022[532] | Joe Gebbia | Co-founder, board member and advisor of Airbnb[533] | Yes\n |\n| 2023[521] | J.

Its subsidiary Tesla Energy develops and is a major installer of photovoltaic systems in the United States and is one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems with 6.5 gigawatt-hours (GWh) installed in 2022.\n\n\nTesla is one of the world's most valuable companies and, as of 2023[update], is the world's most valuable automaker. In 2022, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 18% share.\n\n\nTesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a $6.5 million investment, Elon Musk became the company's largest shareholder. He became CEO in 2008. Tesla's announced mission is to create products which help \"accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.\"\n\n\nThe company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, in 2008. This was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck light-duty pickup truck in 2023.[7] The Model 3 is the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[8] Tesla's 2022 deliveries were around 1.31 million vehicles, a 40% increase over the previous year,[9][10] and cumulative sales totaled 4 million cars as of April 2023.[11] In October 2021, Tesla's market capitalization temporarily reached $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history.\n\n\nTesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations, product defects, and Musk's many controversial statements.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Tesla, Inc.\n\n![](image)Tesla Motors insignia as seen on a Tesla Roadster, c. 2010\n### Founding (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\nThe company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[12][13] Eberhard and Tarpenning served as CEO and CFO, respectively.[14] Eberhard said that he wanted to build \"a car manufacturer that is also a technology company\", with its core technologies as \"the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor\".[15]\n\n\nIan Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later.[12] In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12 million in 2023) in series A funding, including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10 million in 2023) from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.[16][17][14] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[18]\n\n\nA lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.[19]\n\n\n\n### Roadster (2005–2009)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Roadster (first generation)\n\nElon Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[20] The company's strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[21]\n\n\nIn February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team.[22][17] Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll.[23] A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.[23]\n\n\nTesla's first car, the Roadster, was officially revealed to the public on July 19, 2006, in Santa Monica, California, at a 350-person invitation-only event held in Barker Hangar at Santa Monica Airport.[24]\n\n\nIn August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO.[25] Eberhard then took the title of \"President of Technology\" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008. Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008.[26] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and President.[27] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[27] In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[28]\n\n\nTesla began production of the Roadster in 2008 inside the service bays of a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park.[29][30] By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed $70 million of his own money to the company.[31]\n\n\nIn June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive $465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy. The funding, part of the $8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supported the engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology.[32] Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with $12 million in interest.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### IPO, Model S, and Model X (2010–2015)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First deliveries of Model S at the Tesla Fremont Factory in California, in June 2012\nIn May 2010, Tesla purchased what would later become the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California, from Toyota for $42 million,[35] and opened the facility in October 2010 to start production of the Model S.[36] On June 29, 2010, the company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ, the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956.[37] The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17 per share, raising $226 million.[38]\n\n\nIn January 2012, Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan.[39] The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year,[40] and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it achieved first place in the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013.[41] The Model S was also the bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016.[42]\n\n\nTesla announced the Tesla Autopilot, a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called \"hardware version 1\".[43]\n\n\nTesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business) battery packs in April 2015.[44] The company received orders valued at $800 million within a week of the unveiling.[45]\n\n\nTesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at the time.[46][47]\n\n\n\n### SolarCity and Model 3 (2016–2018)[edit]\n\n\nTesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6 billion deal.[48] The business was merged with Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy subsidiary.[49] The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of which Tesla's shareholders were not informed.[50] In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better reflect the scope of its expanded business.[51]\n\n\nTesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. Compared to Tesla's previous luxury vehicles, the Model 3 was less expensive and within a week the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[52] In an effort to speed up production and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3. Instead, the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles,[53] leading to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company would later come to describe as \"production hell.\"[54][55] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 would become the world's bestselling electric car from 2018 to 2021.[56][57]\n\n\nThis period of production hell put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private.[58][59] The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC, which would force Musk to step down as the company's chairman, although he was allowed to remain CEO.\n\n\n\n### Global expansion and Model Y (2019–present)[edit]\n\n\nFrom July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500.[60] Tesla was added to the index on December 21, 2020.[61] It was the most valuable company ever added, already the sixth-largest member.[61] During 2020, the share price increased 740%,[62] and on January 26, 2021, its market capitalization reached $848 billion,[63] more than the next nine largest automakers combined and becoming the US' 5th most valuable company.[64][65] In July 2020, Tesla reached a valuation of $206 billion, surpassing Toyota to become the world's most valuable automaker.[66] On August 31, 2020, Tesla completed a 5-for-1 stock split.[67]\n\n\nTesla introduced its second mass-market vehicle in March 2019, the Model Y mid-size crossover SUV, based on the Model 3.[68][69] Deliveries started in March 2020.[70]\n\n\nDuring this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession. Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company (not a joint venture).[71] The first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out of the factory in December, less than one year after groundbreaking.[72] Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg broke ground in February 2020,[73] and production of the Model Y began in March 2022.[74] Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June 2020,[75] and production of the Model Y began in April 2022.[76] Tesla has also announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in 2025.[77]\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the entire automotive industry, and Tesla was no exception. Government officials in China closed Gigafactory Shanghai and lawmakers in California shut down production at the Tesla Fremont Factory. While China allowed Tesla to resume production a few weeks later, California did not. Tesla would ultimately defy state orders, and restart production on May 11, 2020.[78]\n\n\nAfter the dispute with California officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas.[79][80] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years significantly expanded its footprint in California. The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in Lathrop, California in 2022,[81] and announced in February 2023 that it would establish a large global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard.[82]\n\n\nTesla became a major investor in bitcoin, acquiring $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency,[83] and on March 24, 2021, the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases.[84] However, after 49 days, the company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of fossil fuels, against the company's mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy.[85] After the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped around 12%.[86] In July 2022 it was reported that Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company's profitability.[87]\n\n\n\n## Automotive products and services[edit]\n\n\n\"Tesla electric car\" redirects here.

Tesla claims that the Semi has approximately three times the power of a typical diesel semi truck, a range of 500 miles (800 km).[94] Two prototype trucks were first shown in November 2017 and initial deliveries were made to PepsiCo on December 1, 2022.[95] As of July 2023[update], the truck remains in pilot production,[3] and Tesla does not expect the truck to enter volume production before 2024, due to limited availability of the required 4680 battery cells.[96]\n\n\n### Announced products[edit]\n\n\n#### Cybertruck[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Cybertruck\n\n![](image)Tesla Cybertruck\nThe Cybertruck is a pickup truck unveiled on November 21, 2019.[97] The truck's novel design made of flat sheets of unpainted stainless steel and bulletproof glass windows earned a mixed reception.[98][99][100] As of February 2023, Musk has stated that deliveries are planned to begin by the end of Q3 2023.[101]\n\n\n\n\n#### Roadster (second generation)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Roadster (second generation)\n\n![](image)Tesla Roadster prototype\nOn November 16, 2017, Tesla unveiled the second generation Roadster with a purported range of 620 miles (1,000 km) with a 200 kilowatt-hours (720 MJ) battery pack that would achieve 0–60 miles per hour (0–97 km/h) in 1.9 seconds; and 0–100 mph (0–161 km/h) in 4.2 seconds,[102] and a top speed over 250 mph (400 km/h). A \"SpaceX Package\" would include cold-gas thrusters.[103] The vehicle would have three electric motors, allowing all-wheel drive and torque vectoring during cornering.[103] The base price was set at $200,000.[103] Musk has said that the Roadster should ship in 2024.[104]\n\n\n\n\n#### Tesla next-generation vehicle[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla next-generation vehicle\n\nThe Tesla next-generation vehicle is an announced battery electric platform. It would become the third platform for the company. Vehicles based on this platform are not expected before 2025.[105]\n\n\n\n\n### Discontinued product[edit]\n\n\n#### Tesla Roadster[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Roadster (first generation)\n\n![](image)The original Roadster\nThe original Tesla Roadster[106] was a two-seater sports car, evolved from the Lotus Elise chassis.[107] It was produced from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway-legal serial production electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles (320 km) per charge.\n\n\n\n\n### Connectivity services[edit]\n\n\nTesla cars come with \"Standard Connectivity\", which provides navigation using a cellular connection. For a fee, Tesla offers a subscription to \"Premium Connectivity\" which adds live traffic and satellite maps to navigation, internet browsing, and media streaming.[108]\n\n\n\n### Vehicle servicing[edit]\n\n\nTesla service strategy is to service its vehicles first through remote diagnosis and repair. If it is not possible to resolve a problem remotely, customers are referred to a local Tesla-owned service center, or a mobile technician is dispatched.[109][110] Tesla has said that it does not want to make a profit on vehicle servicing, which has traditionally been a large profit center for most auto dealerships.[111]\n\n\nIn 2016, Tesla recommended having any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: \"your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes,\" and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.[112]\n\n\n\n###  Charging services[edit]\n\n\n####  Supercharger network[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Supercharger\n\nSupercharger is the branding used by Tesla for its high-voltage direct current fast chargers.\n\n\n\n![](image)Tesla Supercharger station in Onalaska, Wisconsin\nThe Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with five sites in California and Nevada. As of January 2024[update], Tesla operates a network of 6,350 Supercharger stations with over 58,000 connectors. The stations are primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,650), North America (over 2,500), and Europe (over 1,200). Since 2019 most superchargers deployed have been able to output as much as 250kW. As of January 2024[update] approximately 68% of chargers have V3 or V4 stalls capable of outputting this amount.\n\n#### Destination charging location network[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\"Destination Charger\" in North America\nTesla also has a network of \"Destination Chargers,\" slower than Superchargers and intended for locations where customers are expected to park and stay for several hours, such as hotels, restaurants, or shopping centers. Unlike the Supercharger network, Tesla does not own the destination chargers, instead, property owners setup the devices and set pricing.[113] When the network first launched in 2014, Tesla provided free charging equipment and covered installation costs.[114] One of the largest providers is hotel chain Hilton Worldwide which in 2023 announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 chargers across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025.[115]\n\n\n\n### Insurance services[edit]\n\n\nTesla has offered its own vehicle insurance in the United States since 2017 and has been acting as an independent insurance producer since 2021 as Tesla Insurance Services, Inc. It was introduced after the American Automobile Association (AAA), a major insurance carrier, raised rates for Tesla owners in June 2017 after a report concluded that the automakers vehicles crashed more often and were more expensive to repair than comparable vehicles.[116] A second study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety confirmed the findings.[117]\n\n\nThe company says that it uniquely understands its vehicles, technology and repair costs, and can eliminate traditional insurance carriers' additional charges.[118] In states where allowed, the company uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing that can increase or decrease in cost based on the prior month's driving safety score.[119] As of 2023, insurance was available in 12 states.[120]\n\n\nAs of January 2023[update], Tesla offers insurance in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia. The company also offers insurance for Tesla vehicle owners with non-Tesla vehicles.[118]\n\n\n\n## Energy products[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Energy\n\n![](image)Two Tesla Powerwall 2 home energy storage devices from Tesla Energy\nTesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy generation systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and services) to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016.[121] In 2022, the company deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 348 megawatts, an increase of 3 megawatts over 2021, and deployed 6.5 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, an increase of 64% over 2021.[122]\n\n\nTesla Energy products include solar panels (built by other companies for Tesla), the Tesla Solar Roof (a solar shingle system) and the Tesla Solar Inverter. Storage products include the Powerwall (a home energy storage device) and the Megapack (a large-scale energy storage system).[123][124][125]\n\n\nFor large-scale customers, Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for automated, real-time power trading, demand forecasting and product control.[126][127][128] In March 2021, the company said its online products were managing over 1.2 GWh of storage.[129] For home customers, the company operates a virtual power company in Texas called Tesla Electric, which utilizes the company's online platforms to manage customers Powerwall devices, discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high, earning money for customers.[130][131]\n\n\n\n## Business strategy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robotic manufacturing of the Model S at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California\nAt the time of Tesla's founding in 2003, electric vehicles were very expensive.[132] In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla's strategy was to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price. This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars.[21][133] Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-volume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The most recent models, the Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market,[134][135] selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter. Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year, as opposed to nearly every other car manufacturer.[136]\n\n\nUnlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell vehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores.[137][138] The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers.[139][140] Some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls *galleries* that the company says \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[141][142] In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries.[143] These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas,[138] instead of near other auto dealerships.[144][145][146]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Tesla Patent Wall at its headquarters was removed after the company announced its patents are part of the open source movement.[147]\nAnalysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically *outsource* 80% of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.[149][150][151]\n\n\nTesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the world's use of sustainable energy.[152] Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[153] Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.[154]\n\n\n\n## Technology[edit]\n\n\nTesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148]\n\n\n\n### Batteries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tesla vehicle chassis used in Model S and X, with the battery visible\n![](image)Comparison of Tesla's three cylindrical battery cell form factors\nAs of 2023, Tesla uses four different battery cell form factors: 18650, 2170, 4680, and prismatic.[155][156][157]\n\n\nTesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers, CATL, LG Energy Solution, and Panasonic, the latter of which has co-located some of its battery production inside Tesla's Gigafactory Nevada. Tesla is also currently building out the capacity to produce its own batteries.\n\n\nTesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space. Tesla uses a multi-part aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from road debris and/or vehicle crashes.[158]\n\n\nBusiness analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla's battery pack cost in 2021 at $112 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), versus an industry average of $132 per kWh.[159]\n\n\n\n#### 18650[edit]\n\n\nTesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical, lithium-ion battery cells. When it built the first generation Roadster, it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18 mm diameter, 65 mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge, requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention chemical.[160] However, the decision proved to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest technology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic's factories in Japan.[161]\n\n\n\n#### 2170[edit]\n\n\nThe next battery type to be used was 2170-type (21 mm diameter, 70 mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170 was introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles.[161]\n\n\nFor vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic's production line at Gigafactory Nevada.[162] In January 2021, Panasonic had the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there.[163] Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product.\n\n\nFor vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg batteries with a nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC) cathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution's factories in China.[161]\n\n\n\n#### 4680[edit]\n\n\nTesla's latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680-type (46 mm diameter, 80 mm height) introduced in 2021. The battery was developed in-house by Tesla and is physically 5-times bigger than the 2170-type, again allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack.[164][165] Currently, Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed the cathode chemistry. The company has already opened production lines in Fremont, California, and plans to open lines inside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas. The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at Gigafactory Texas.[161]\n\n\n\n#### Prismatic[edit]\n\n\nTesla also uses prismatic (rectangular) cells in many entry-level Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.[161] The prismatic cells are a lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP or LiFePO  \n4) which is a less energy-dense type, but do not contain any nickel or cobalt, which makes it less expensive to produce.[166] Tesla sources these batteries from CATL's factories in China. As of April 2022[update], nearly half of Tesla's vehicle production used prismatic cells.[167] Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its Megapack grid-scale energy storage product.[168]\n\n\n\n#### Research[edit]\n\n\nTesla invests in lithium-ion battery research. In 2016, the company established a 5-year battery research and development partnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, with lead researcher Jeff Dahn.[169][170][171][172] Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies for over $200 million[173] – and sold in 2021.[174] It also acquired Hibar Systems.[175][176] Tesla purchased several battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International, a small Canadian battery company.[177][178]\n\n\n\n### Software[edit]\n\n\nTesla uses over-the-air updates to deliver updates to vehicles, adding features or fixing problems.[179] This is enabled by tight integration between a few powerful onboard computers, compared to the way automakers had previously handled technology, by purchasing off-the-shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the software level.[180]\n\n\nThe system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to. For example, for ease of assembly all Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats, but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn them on. However, Tesla has allowed customers who didn't pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear seats.[181] Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full-Self Driving features, even though all vehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features.[182]\n\n\n\n### Motors[edit]\n\n\nTesla makes two kinds of electric motors. Its oldest design in production is a three-phase four-pole alternating current induction motor (asynchronous motor) with a copper rotor[183] (which inspired the Tesla logo). These motors use electromagnetic induction, by varying magnetic field to produce torque. Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model 3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster.\n\n\nNewer, higher efficiency permanent magnet motors have been in use since the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017. They are currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y, the front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi.[184] The permanent magnet motors are more efficient, especially in stop-start driving.[185]\n\n\n\n###  North American Charging Standard[edit]\n\n\nMain article: North American Charging Standard\n\nThe North American Charging Standard (NACS) is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla. It has been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since 2012 and was opened for use to other manufacturers in 2022. Since then, nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from 2025, their electric vehicles sold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port. Several electric vehicle charging network operators and equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors.[186]\n\n\n\n### Autopilot[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Autopilot\n\n![](image)Tesla Autopilot in operation\nAutopilot is an advanced driver-assistance system developed by Tesla. The system requires active driver supervision at all times.[187]\n\n\nSince September 2014, all Tesla cars are shipped with sensors (initially hardware version 1 or \"HW1\") and software to support Autopilot.[188] Tesla upgraded its sensors and software in October 2016 (\"HW2\") to support full self-driving in the future.[189] HW2 includes eight cameras, twelve ultrasonic sensors, and forward-facing radar.[189] HW2.5 was released in mid-2017, and it upgraded HW2 with a second graphics processing unit (GPU) and, for the Model 3 only, a driver-facing camera.[190] HW3 was released in early 2019 with an updated and more powerful computer, employing a custom Tesla-designed system on a chip.[191]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Tesla announced that all of its cars will include Autopilot software (defined as just *Traffic-Aware Cruise Control* and *Autosteer* (Beta)) as a standard feature moving forward.[192] Full self-driving software (Autopark, Navigate on Autopilot (Beta), Auto Lane Change (Beta), Summon (Beta), Smart Summon (Beta) and future abilities) is an extra cost option.[192]\n\n\nIn 2020, Tesla released software updates where its cars recognize and automatically stop at stop signs and traffic lights.[193][194][195] In May 2021, Tesla removed the radar sensor and radar features from its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, opting instead to rely on camera vision alone.[196][197][198] The *New York Times* reported in December 2021 that Musk \"repeatedly told members of the Autopilot team that humans could drive with only two eyes and that this meant cars should be able to drive with cameras alone,\" an analogy some experts and former Tesla engineers described as \"deeply flawed.\"[199] Similarly, a statistical analysis conducted in *A Methodology for Normalizing Safety Statistics of Partially Automated Vehicles* debunked a common Tesla claim that Autopilot reduced crash rates by 40 percent[200] by accounting for the relative safety of the given operating domain when using active safety measures.[201]\n\n\n\n### Full Self-Driving[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tesla Autopilot § Full Self-Driving\n\n*Full Self-Driving* (FSD) is an optional extension of Autopilot promoted as eventually being able to perform fully autonomous driving. At the end of 2016, Tesla expected to demonstrate full autonomy by the end of 2017,[202] which as of July 2022[update] has not occurred.[203] The first beta version of the software was released on October 22, 2020, to a small group of testers.[204] The release of the beta has renewed concern regarding whether the technology is ready for testing on public roads.[205][206] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has called for \"tougher requirements\" for any testing of Autopilot on public roads.[207]\n\n\nTesla's approach to achieve full autonomy is different from that of other companies.[208] Whereas Waymo, Cruise, and other companies are relying on highly detailed (centimeter-scale) three-dimensional maps, lidar, and cameras, as well as radar and ultrasonic sensors in their autonomous vehicles, Tesla's approach is to use coarse-grained two-dimensional maps and cameras (no lidar) as well as radar and ultrasonic sensors.[208][209] Tesla claims that although its approach is much more difficult, it will ultimately be more useful, because its vehicles will be able to self-drive without geofencing concerns.[210] Tesla's self-driving software has been trained on over 20 billion miles driven by Tesla vehicles as of January 2021.[211] Tesla also designed a self-driving computer chip that has been installed in its cars since March 2019.[212]\n\n\nMost experts believe that Tesla's approach of trying to achieve full self-driving by eschewing lidar and high-definition maps is not feasible.[213][214][215] In March 2021, according to a letter that Tesla sent to the California Department of Motor Vehicles about FSD's capability – acquired by PlainSite via a public records request – Tesla stated that FSD is not capable of autonomous driving and is only at Society of Automotive Engineers Level 2 automation.[216] In a May 2021 study by Guidehouse Insights, Tesla was ranked last for both strategy and execution in the autonomous driving sector.[217] In October 2021, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) called on Tesla to change the design of its Autopilot to ensure it cannot be misused by drivers, according to a letter sent to Musk.[218]\n\n\n\n### Robotics[edit]\n\n\nAhead of the start of production of the Model 3, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble vehicles. To that end, between 2015 and 2017, the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including Compass Automation,[219] Grohmann Automation,[220] Perbix Machine Company, and Riviera Tool and Die.[221] Elon Musk later admitted that the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[53]\n\n\nTesla uses massive casting machines (Giga Press) to make large single pieces of vehicle underbodies and to streamline production.[222] This saves time, labor, cost and factory space, replacing multiple robots that weld car parts together with a single machine.[223]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Tesla revealed prototypes of a humanoid robot named Optimus, which Musk has stated uses the same core software as FSD. During the presentations at Tesla's AI Day 2022, Musk suggested that, among other use cases, the finalized version of Optimus could be used in Tesla's car factories to help with repetitive tasks and relieve labor shortages.[224]\n\n\nIn July 2023, Tesla acquired Wiferion, a Germany-based developer of wireless charging systems for industrial vehicles and autonomous robots, which has since been operating as Tesla Engineering Germany GmbH.[225] Tesla sold the business to Munich-based Puls Group three months later, but retained its staff.[226][227]\n\n\n\n### Glass[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2016, the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof's solar shingles.[228]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Tesla factories\n\nThe company operates seven large factories and about a dozen smaller factories around the world. As of 2023[update], the company also operates more than 1,000 retail stores, galleries, service, delivery and body shop locations globally.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary facilities operated by Tesla\n| Opened\n | Name\n | City\n | Country\n | Employees\n | Products\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010\n | Tesla Fremont Factory | Fremont, California | United States\n | 22,000\n | Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y | [35][229][230] |\n| 2016\n | Gigafactory Nevada | Storey County, Nevada | United States\n | 7,000\n | Batteries, Powerwall, Semi | [231][232][233] |\n| 2017\n | Gigafactory New York | Buffalo, New York | United States\n | 1,500\n | Solar Roof, Supercharger | [234][235] |\n| 2019\n | Gigafactory Shanghai | Shanghai | China\n | 20,000\n | Model 3, Model Y, Supercharger\n | [236][237] |\n| 2022\n | Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg | Grünheide | Germany\n | 10,000\n | Model Y *(planned: batteries, Model 3)* | [238][239][240] |\n| 2022\n | Gigafactory Texas | Austin, Texas | United States\n | 12,000\n | Model Y *(planned: batteries, Cybertruck, Next-gen vehicle)* | [241][242][243] |\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tesla Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory New York, Gigafactory Texas, and Gigafactory Mexico\n\n![](image)New Tesla Model S cars at the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2012\nTesla was founded in San Carlos, California.[244] In 2010, Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto.[245] Tesla's first retail store was opened in 2008 in Los Angeles.[246]\n\n\nTesla's first assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, known as the Tesla Fremont Factory. The factory was originally opened by General Motors in 1962, and then operated by NUMMI, a joint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984.[247] The joint venture ended when GM entered bankruptcy in 2009. In 2010, Toyota agreed to sell the plant to Tesla at a significant discount.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gigafactory Nevada in 2019\n![](image)Gigafactory Texas in 2022\nTesla's first purpose-built facility was opened in Nevada in 2016. Gigafactory Nevada produces Powerwalls, Powerpacks and Megapacks;[231] battery cells in partnership with Panasonic;[248] and Model 3 drivetrains.[249] The factory received substantial subsidies (abatements and credits) from the local and state government, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla to operate essentially tax free for 10 years.[250]\n\n\nAs part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla gained control of Gigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant. The state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the Buffalo Billion program.[251][252] In 2017, the factory started production of the Tesla Solar Roof,[234] but faced multiple production challenges. Since 2020, Tesla has also assembled Superchargers in New York. The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state funding.[253]\n\n\nOn July 23, 2020, Tesla picked Austin, Texas, as the site of its fifth Gigafactory, since then known as Gigafactory Texas.[254] Giga Texas is planned to be the main factory for the Tesla Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi; it will also produce Model 3 and Model Y cars for the Eastern United States.[255][242] On April 7, 2022, Tesla celebrated the opening of the facility in a public event.[76]\n\n\nOn December 1, 2021, Tesla relocated its legal headquarters from Palo Alto, California, to the Gigafactory site in Austin, Texas.[256]\n\n\nTesla acquired a former JC Penney distribution center near Lathrop, California, in 2021 to build the \"Megafactory\" to manufacture the Megapack, the company's large scale energy storage product.[257][258] The location opened in 2022.\n\n\nTesla announced in February it would open a new global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard, located a couple of miles from Tesla's former headquarters.\n\n\nTesla plans to open Gigafactory Mexico, the company's sixth Gigafactory near Monterrey, Mexico in 2025.\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tesla facilities in Tilburg and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg\n\n![](image)Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg under construction in October 2021\nTesla opened its first European store in June 2009 in London.[259] Tesla's European headquarters are in the Netherlands,[260] part of a group of Tesla facilities in Tilburg, including the company's European Distribution Centre.[261]\n\n\nIn late 2016, Tesla acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering as a new division dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process.[262] After winding down existing contracts with other manufacturers, the renamed Tesla Automation now works exclusively on Tesla projects.[263]\n\n\nTesla announced its plans to build a car and battery factory in Europe in 2016.[264] Several countries campaigned to be the host,[265] and eventually Germany was chosen in November 2019.[266] On March 22, 2022, Tesla's first European Gigafactory named Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg[267][268] opened with planned capacity to produce 500,000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars.[268]\n\n\n\n### Asia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gigafactory Shanghai\n\n![](image)Tesla store in Tokyo, the first in Asia[269]\nTesla opened its first showroom in Asia in Tokyo, Japan, in October 2010.[270]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Tesla signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a factory in Shanghai, China, which was Tesla's first Gigafactory outside of the United States.[271] The factory building was finished in August 2019, and the initial Tesla Model 3s were in production from Gigafactory Shanghai in October 2019.[236] In 2021, China accounted for 26% of Tesla sales revenue, and was the second largest market for Tesla after the United States, which accounted for 45% of its sales.[272]\n\n\nTesla has expressed interest in expanding to India and perhaps building a future Gigafactory in the country.[273] The company established a legal presence in the nation in 2021 and plans to open an office in Pune starting in October 2023.[274]\n\n\n\n## Partners[edit]\n\n\n### Panasonic[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Panasonic Energy president Naoto Noguchi, presents Tesla executive JB Straubel, with lithium-ion cells\nIn January 2010, Tesla and battery cell maker Panasonic announced that they would together develop nickel-based lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles.[275] The partnership was part of Panasonic's $1 billion investment over three years in facilities for lithium-ion cell research, development and production.[276]\n\n\nBeginning in 2010, Panasonic invested $30 million for a multi-year collaboration on new battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles.[277] In July 2014, Panasonic reached a basic agreement with Tesla to participate in battery production at Giga Nevada.[278]\n\n\nTesla and Panasonic also collaborated on the manufacturing and production of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules at the Giga New York factory in Buffalo, New York.[234] The partnership started in mid-2017 and ended in early 2020, before Panasonic exited the solar business entirely in January 2021.[279][280]\n\n\nIn March 2021, the outgoing CEO of Panasonic stated that the company plans to reduce its reliance on Tesla as their battery partnership evolves.[281]\n\n\n\n### Other current partners[edit]\n\n\nTesla has long-term contracts in place for lithium supply. In September 2020, Tesla signed a sales agreement with Piedmont Lithium to buy high-purity lithium ore for up to ten years,[282] specifically to supply \"spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's North Carolina mineral deposit\".[283] In 2022, Tesla contracted for 110,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate over four years from the Core Lithium's lithium mine in the Northern Territory of Australia.[284]\n\n\nTesla also has a range of minor partnerships, for instance working with Airbnb and hotel chains to install destination chargers at selected locations.[285]\n\n\n\n### Former partners[edit]\n\n\n#### Daimler[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive used a Tesla-supplied battery pack.[286]\nDaimler and Tesla began working together in late 2007. On May 19, 2009, Daimler bought a stake of less than 10% in Tesla for a reported $50 million.[287][288] As part of the collaboration, Herbert Kohler, vice-president of E-Drive and Future Mobility at Daimler, took a Tesla board seat.[289] On July 13, 2009, Daimler sold 40% of its acquisition to Aabar, an investment company controlled by the International Petroleum Investment Company owned by the government of Abu Dhabi.[290] In October 2014, Daimler sold its remaining holdings for a reported $780 million.[291]\n\n\nTesla supplied battery packs for Freightliner Trucks in 2010.[292][293] The company also built electric-powertrain components for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-Cell, with 500 cars planned to be built for trial in Europe beginning in September 2011.[294][295] Tesla produced and co-developed the Mercedes-Benz B250e's powertrain, which ended production in 2017.[296] The electric motor was rated 134 hp (100 kW) and 230 pound force-feet (310 N⋅m), with a 36 kWh (130 MJ) battery. The vehicle had a driving range of 200 km (124 mi) with a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph).[297] Daimler division Smart produced the Smart ED2 cars from 2009 to 2012 which had a 14-kilowatt-hour (50 MJ) lithium-ion battery from Tesla.[298][299]\n\n\n\n#### Toyota[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toyota RAV4 EV, which used a Tesla-supplied battery and powertrain components\nIn May 2010, Tesla and Toyota announced a deal in which Tesla purchased the former NUMMI factory from Toyota for $42 million, Toyota purchased $50 million in Tesla stock, and the two companies collaborated on an electric vehicle.[35]\n\n\nIn July 2010, the companies announced they would work together on a second generation Toyota RAV4 EV.[300] The vehicle was unveiled at the October 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show and 35 pilot vehicles were built for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. Tesla supplied the lithium metal-oxide battery and other powertrain components[301][302] based on components from the Roadster.[303]\n\n\nThe production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from the Tesla Model S sedan (also launched in 2012).[304] The RAV4 EV had a limited production run which resulted in just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.[305][306]\n\n\nAccording to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was \"marred by clashes between engineers\".[307] Toyota engineers rejected designs that Tesla had proposed for an enclosure to protect the RAV4 EV's battery pack. Toyota took over responsibility for the enclosure's design and strengthened it. In 2014, Tesla ended up adding a titanium plate to protect the Model S sedan's battery after some debris-related crashes lead to cars catching fire.[307][158] On June 5, 2017, Toyota announced that it had sold all of its shares in Tesla and halted the partnership.[308][309]\n\n\n\n#### Mobileye[edit]\n\n\nInitial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with Mobileye beginning in 2014.[310] Mobileye ended the partnership on July 26, 2016, citing \"disagreements about how the technology was deployed.\"[311]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc. and Criticism of Tesla, Inc.\n\n### Sexual harassment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at Tesla's Fremont factory.[312] They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment. The women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, unwanted touching, and discrimination while at work. \"I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief,\" Brooks told *The Washington Post*. \"That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job.\" Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex.[313]\n\n\nWomen feared calling Human Resources for help as their supervisors were often participants.[314] Musk himself is not indicted, but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. They cite his crude remarks about women's bodies, wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to \"T.IT.S\", and his generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment.[315] \"What we're addressing for each of the lawsuits is just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla,\" said attorney David A. Lowe.[314] In 2017, another woman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired. In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired her, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee's allegations with the help of \"a neutral, third-party expert\" and concluded her complaints were unmerited.[316]\n\n\nIn May 2022, a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court, rejecting Tesla's request for closed-door arbitration.[317]\n\n\n\n### Labor disputes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tesla and unions\n\nIn June 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) took issue with Tesla's use of nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) regarding customer repairs[318] and, in October 2021, the NHTSA formally asked Tesla to explain its NDA policy regarding customers invited into the FSD Beta.[319] Tesla has used NDAs on multiple occasions with both employees[320] and customers[321] to allegedly prevent possible negative coverage.[322][323]\n\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Tesla's Fremont Factory had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations as the ten largest U.S. auto plants combined.[324] An investigation by the Reveal podcast alleged that Tesla \"failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports\" to downplay the extent of injuries.[325]\n\n\nIn January 2019, former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company had hacked employees' phones and spied on them, while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and shareholders.[326][327][328] Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla. These include the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez[329][330] and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen.[331] In 2020, the court ordered Hansen's case to arbitration.[332] In June 2022, the arbitrator filed an unopposed motion with the court stating Hansen \"has failed to establish the claims...Accordingly his claims are denied, and he shall take nothing\".[333]\n\n\nIn September 2019, a California judge ruled that 12 actions in 2017 and 2018 by Musk and other Tesla executives violated labor laws because they sabotaged employee attempts to unionize.[334][335]\n\n\nIn March 2021, the US National Labor Relations Board ordered Musk to remove a tweet and reinstate a fired employee over union organization activities.[336][337] Later, after appealing, a federal appeals court upheld the decision.[338]\n\n\nThe California Civil Rights Department filed a suit in 2022 alleging \"a pattern of racial harassment and bias\" at the Tesla Fremont factory. As of April 2023,[update] the department is also conducting a probe of the factory based on a 2021 complaint and claims that Tesla has been obstructing the investigation.[339]\n\n\n\n### Fraud allegations[edit]\n\n\nThere have been numerous concerns about Tesla's financial reporting. In 2013, *Bloomberg News* questioned whether Tesla's financial reporting violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) reporting standards.[340] *Fortune* accused Tesla in 2016 of using creative accounting to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits.[341] In 2018, analysts expressed concerns over Tesla's accounts receivable balance.[342] In September 2019, the SEC questioned Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn about Tesla's warranty reserves and lease accounting.[343] In a letter to his clients, hedge fund manager David Einhorn, whose firm suffered losses from its short position against Tesla that quarter, accused Elon Musk in November 2019 of \"significant fraud\",[344][345] and publicly questioned Tesla's accounting practices, telling Musk that he was \"beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist.\"[346]\n\n\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than $295 million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a battery-swapping technology that was never made available to customers.[347] Staff at California Air Resources Board were concerned that Tesla was \"gaming\" the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits.[348]\n\n\nA consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition, that he and the Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the deal, and failed to disclose \"troubling facts\" essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition.[349] The members of the board settled in 2020, leaving Musk as the only defendant.[350] In April 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in favor of Musk,[351][352] and its ruling was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in June 2023.[353]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\"[354] The tweet caused the stock to initially rise but then drop when it was revealed to be false.[355][356][357] Musk settled fraud charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his false statements in September 2018. According to the terms of the settlement, Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla's in-house counsel, he was removed from his chairman role at Tesla temporarily, and two new independent directors were appointed to the company's board.[358] Tesla and Musk also paid civil penalties of $20 million each.[358] A civil class-action shareholder lawsuit over Musk's statements and other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors, as then constituted, in regard to claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private.[359][360] In February 2023, a California jury unanimously found Musk and Tesla not liable in the class-action lawsuit.[361]\n\n\nIn September 2018, Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding its Model 3 production figures.[362] Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and made projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet.[362] A stockholder class action lawsuit against Tesla related to Model 3 production numbers (unrelated to the FBI investigation) was dismissed in March 2019.[363][364]\n\n\n\n### Tesla US dealership disputes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tesla US dealership disputes\n\nUnlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles and instead directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. In some areas, Tesla operates locations called \"galleries\" which \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[141] This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete with each other, lowering the price a customer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their own dealers.[144] The United States Federal Trade Commission ultimately disproved the associations' claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[365][366][367]\n\n\nTesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars.[368] The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles,[141] because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gas-powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since properly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas-powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to dealership EV sales.[144] Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles because they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after-sales service revenue, a large profit center for most dealerships.[111]\n\n\n\n### Intellectual property[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Alex Khatilov alleging that the former employee stole company information by downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his personal Dropbox account.[369] Khatilov denies the allegation that he was acting as a \"willful and malicious thief\" and attributes his actions to an accidental data transfer.[370] The case was settled in August 2021 through mediation.[371]\n\n\nTesla has sued former employees in the past for similar actions, including those who left to work for a rival such as XPeng and Zoox;[372] for example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading Tesla Autopilot source code to his iCloud account;[373] Tesla and Cao settled in April 2021, in which Cao was ordered to monetarily compensate Tesla.[374]\n\n\n\n### Misappropriation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by approving Musk's stock-based compensation plan.[360] Musk received the first portion of his stock options payout, worth more than $700 million in May 2020.[375]\n\n\nIn July 2023, Tesla board members returned $735 million to the company to settle a claim from a 2020 lawsuit alleging misappropriation of 11 million stock options granted to Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Larry Ellison, and others from 2017 to 2020.[376]\n\n\n\n### Environmental violations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, The United States Environmental Protection Agency fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in 2017.[377] In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District;[378] the violations took place around Tesla Fremont's paint shop, where there had been at least four fires between 2014 and 2019.[379] Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla's Fremont Factory increased from 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3.[380]\n\n\nIn June 2018, Tesla employee Martin Tripp leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40% of its raw materials at the Nevada Gigafactory.[381] After Tesla fired him for the leak, Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Tesla's security team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory.[382][326] The court ruled in Tesla's favor on September 17, 2020.[383][384]\n\n\n\n### Property damage[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Walmart filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that Tesla's \"negligent installation and maintenance\" of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012.[385] Walmart reached a settlement with Tesla in November 2019; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[386]\n\n\nIn May 2021, a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 over-the-air software update, awarding each of the 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit 136,000 Norwegian kroner ($16,000).[387]\n\n\n\n### Racism[edit]\n\n\nTesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination,[388][389] with one former Tesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as \"a hotbed of racist behavior\".[390] As of December 2021, three percent of leadership at the company are African American.[391] A former black worker described the work environment at Tesla's Buffalo plant as a \"very racist place\".[392] Tesla and SpaceX's treatment of Juneteenth in 2020 also came under fire.[393] Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that Tesla discriminates specifically against African Americans and \"allows a racist environment in its factories.\"[394] According to the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place where Black employees claim they are given the most menial[395] and physically demanding work.[396] The accusations of racism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for \"discriminating against its Black workers.\"[397]\n\n\nIn July 2021, former employee Melvin Berry received $1 million in his discrimination case in arbitration against Tesla after he claimed he was referred to by the n-word and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant.[398]\n\n\nIn October 2021, a jury verdict in the *Owen Diaz vs. Tesla* trial awarded the plaintiff $137 million in damages after he had faced racial harassment at Tesla's Fremont facility during 2015–2016.[399][400] In a blog, Tesla stressed that Diaz was never \"really\" a Tesla worker, and that most utterings of the n-word were expressed in a friendly manner.[401][402] In April 2022, federal judge William Orrick upheld the jury finding of Tesla's liability but reduced the total damage down to $15 million.[403] Diaz was given a two-week deadline to decide if he would collect the damages. In June 2022, Diaz announced that he would be rejecting the $15 million award, opening the door for a new trial.[404] In April 2023, Diaz was awarded $3.2 million in the new trial.[405]\n\n\nFew of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements.[406] Employees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court, and behind closed doors.\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nTesla's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been the subject of considerable criticism. Musk had sought to exempt the Tesla Fremont factory in Alameda County, California from the government's stay-at-home orders. In an earnings call in April, he was heard calling the public health orders \"fascist\".[407] He had also called the public's response to the pandemic \"dumb\" and had said online that there would be zero cases by April.[408] In May 2020, while Alameda County officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont Factory on the 18th, Musk defied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th.[409][410][78] Tesla also sued Alameda County, questioning the legality of the orders, but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen.[411][412] In June 2020, Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe,[413] however some employees still expressed concern for their health.[414]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work.[415] But in June, Tesla fired an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers from the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory.[416] Three more employees at Tesla's Fremont Factory claimed they were fired for staying home out of fear of catching COVID-19. This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the employees were still on the payroll.[417] COVID-19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December 2020, with about 450 total cases in that time period out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant (4.5%).[407][418]\n\n\nIn China, Tesla had what one executive described as \"not a green light from the government to get back to work – but a flashing-sirens police escort.\"[419] Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China, including tax breaks, cheap financing, and assistance in building its Giga Shanghai factory at breakneck speeds.[419] Musk has praised China's way of doing things, a controversial stance due to deteriorating U.S.–Chinese relations, China's ongoing persecution of Uyghurs, and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong.[419]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Criticism of Tesla, Inc.\n\n### Data privacy[edit]\n\n\nTesla was only the second product ever reviewed by Mozilla foundation which ticked all of their privacy concerns.[420][421]\n\n\nA Tesla owner filed a lawsuit in 2023 following a Reuters report that Tesla employees shared \"highly invasive videos and images recorded by customers' car cameras\" with one another.[422]\n\n\n\n### Short sellers[edit]\n\n\nTSLAQ is a collective of Tesla critics and short sellers who aim to \"shape [the] perception [of Tesla] and move its stock.\"[423] In January 2020, 20% of Tesla stock was shorted, the highest at that time of any stock in the U.S. equity markets.[424] By early 2021, according to CNN, short sellers had lost $40 billion during 2020 as the stock price climbed much higher.[425] Michael Burry, a short seller portrayed in *The Big Short*, had shorted Tesla previously via his firm Scion Asset Management, but removed his position in October 2021.[426]\n\n\n\n### Tesla's mission[edit]\n\n\nAccording to automotive journalist Jamie Kitman, when multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers approached Tesla for EV technology that Musk had claimed the company was willing to share, they instead were offered the opportunity to buy regulatory credits from Tesla. This suggested, according to Kitman, that \"the company may not be as eager for the electric revolution to occur as it claims.\"[427]\n\n\n\n### Giga New York audit[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, the New York State Comptroller released an audit of the Giga New York factory project, concluding that it presented many red flags, including lack of basic due diligence and that the factory itself produced only $0.54 in economic benefits for every $1 spent by the state.[428][429][430]\n\n\n\n### Delays[edit]\n\n\nMusk has been criticized for repeated pushing out both production and release dates of products.[431][432] By one count in 2016, Musk had missed 20 projections.[433] In October 2017, Musk predicted that Model 3 production would be 5,000 units per week by December.[434] A month later, he revised that target to \"sometime in March\" 2018.[435] Delivery dates for the Model 3 were delayed as well.[436] Other projects like converting supercharger stations to be solar-powered have also lagged projections.[437] Musk responded in late 2018: \"punctuality is not my strong suit...I never made a mass-produced car. How am I supposed to know with precision when it's gonna get done?\"[438]\n\n\n\n## Vehicle product issues[edit]\n\n\n### Recalls[edit]\n\n\nOn April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and \"prevent the vehicles from moving\".[439][440] On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to corrosion-susceptible power steering bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use \"increased force\" to control the vehicle.[441]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50,000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China for suspension issues.[442] Soon after in November, the NHTSA announced it had opened its own investigation into 115,000 Tesla cars regarding \"front suspension safety issues\", citing specifically 2015–2017 Model S and 2016–2017 Model X years. Cases of the \"whompy wheel\" phenomenon, which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars, have been documented through 2020.[443][444]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Tesla was required by the NHTSA to recall 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles built from 2012 to 2018 due to using a flash memory device that was rated to last only 5 to 6 years.[445] The problem was related to touchscreen failures that could possibly affect the rear-view camera, safety systems, Autopilot and other features.[446][447] The underlying technical reason is that the car writes a large amount of syslog content to the device, wearing it out prematurely.[448]\n\n\nAlso in February 2021, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) ordered Tesla to recall 12,300 Model X cars because of \"body mouldings problems\".[449][450]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Tesla recalled 5,974 electric vehicles due to worries that brake caliper bolts might become loose, which could lead to loss of tire pressure, potentially increasing the chance of a crash.[451]\n\n\nOn December 30, 2021, Tesla announced that they are recalling more than 475,000 US model vehicles. This included 356,309 Model 3 Tesla vehicles from 2017 to 2020 due to rear-view camera issues and a further 119,009 Tesla Model S vehicles due to potential problems with the trunk or boot. The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2021. Around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera, and around 14% of recalled model S' may have the defect. The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the Passenger Play feature, which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion.[452] After an investigation was launched by the NHTSA covering 585,000 vehicles, Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and unusable while the car is moving.[453]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 1.1 million US model vehicles because the automatic window reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury.[454][455] In response, Tesla announced an over-the-air software fix.[455]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Tesla recalled its FSD software following a recommendation from NHTSA; the recall applied to approximately 360,000 cars.[456] NHTSA found that FSD caused \"unreasonable risk\" when used on city streets.[457] In March 2023, about 3,500 Model Y Teslas were recalled for a bolting issue concerning the cars' second-row seats.[458]\n\n\n\n### Fires[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents § Tesla\n\nTesla customers have reported the company as being \"slow\" to address how their cars can ignite.[459] In 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object.[460] As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[461] In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection to its battery packs.[462] All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[463] In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an investigation into possible battery defects in Tesla's Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause \"non-crash\" fires.[464][465][466]\n\n\n\n### Autopilot crashes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tesla Autopilot § Fatal crashes\n\nA Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot.[467][468] The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safety-related defect trend.[469] In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash. Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in 'self-driving' mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.[470]\n\n\nAccording to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities.[471][472] In early September 2021, the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident[473] and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-responder vehicles.[473][474][475] In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect emergency lights at night.[476] In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it did not issue a recall when it sent out that update.[477] In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla models. The probe will be moved up from the *Preliminary Evaluation* level to the *Engineering Analysis* one. The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to \"explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver's supervision.\"[478]\n\n\nA safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[479] but there has been controversy over its conclusions.[480] Several Tesla fans responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice.[481]\n\n\n\n### Software hacking[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car's entertainment system.[482] The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[483] Tesla issued a security update for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.[484]\n\n\nIn September 2016, researchers at Tencent's Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[485] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.[486] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[487]\n\n\nIn January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[488][489] Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event.[490]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier to start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their own keys to a vehicle.[491]\n\n\n\n### Phantom braking[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2022, Tesla drivers have reported a surge in \"phantom braking\" events when using Tesla Autopilot which coincides with the automaker's removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021.[492] In response, NHTSA has opened an investigation.[493]\n\n\nIn May 2023, German business newspaper *Handelsblatt* published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla data submitted to them from informants.[494] The 100 gigabytes of data \"contain[ed] over 1,000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration\" as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot.[495] Dutch authorities responded by saying they were investigating the company for possible data privacy violations.[496]\n\n\n\n### Driving range performance[edit]\n\n\nTesla has received thousands of complaints from owners that the driving ranges of their vehicles did not meet the ranges advertised by Tesla or the projections of in-dash range meters. When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments to take care of these issues, Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible. Customers were told that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem and their appointments were canceled. The company has been fined by South Korean regulators for its exaggerated range estimates.[497]\n\n\n\n## Vehicle sales[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, Tesla ranked as the world's bestselling battery electric passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of 18%.[498] Tesla reported 2022 vehicle deliveries of 1,313,851 units, up 40% from 2021.[9][10] In March 2023, Tesla produced its 4 millionth car.[499]\n\n\n\n### Production and sales by quarter[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Tesla, Inc. § Timeline of production and sales\n\n100,000\n\n\n200,000\n\n\n300,000\n\n\n400,000\n\n\n500,000\n\n3 2012\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 2013\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 2014\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 2015\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 2016\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 2017\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 2018\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 2019\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 2020\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 2021\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 2022\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 2023\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n1 2024\n\n* Model S\n* Model X\n* Model S/X\n* Model 3\n* Model 3/Y\n\n  \n\nTesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as availability of car carriers and registration. On March 9, 2020, the company produced its 1 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[500] In the third quarter of 2021, Tesla sold its 2 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[501] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y became the world's best-selling car, surpassing the Toyota Corolla.[502]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\nTesla financial performance\n\nFor the fiscal (and calendar) year 2021, Tesla reported a net income of $5.52 billion.[10] The annual revenue was $53.8 billion, an increase of 71% over the previous fiscal year.[10]\n\n\nOf the revenue number in 2021, $314 million came from selling regulatory credits to other automakers to meet government pollution standards. That number has been a smaller percentage of revenue for multiple quarters.[10]\n\n\nTesla ended 2021 with $17.6 billion of cash on hand, down $1.8 billion from the end of 2020.[141]: 31\n\n\nIn February 2021, a 10-K filing revealed that Tesla had invested some $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and the company indicated it would soon accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.[83] Critics then pointed out how investing in cryptocurrency can run counter to Tesla's environmental goals.[503][504] Tesla made more profit from the 2021 investment than the profit from selling cars in 2020, due to the Bitcoin price increase after the investment was announced.[505][506]\n\n\nThe quarter ending June 2021 was the first time Tesla made a profit independent of Bitcoin and regulatory credits.[507]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenue(mil.

Robyn Denholm (since November 2018)[512]\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nTesla has received criticism that its board lacks enough independent directors. In an April 2017 public letter, a group of influential Tesla investors, including the California State Teachers' Retirement System, asked Tesla to add two new independent directors to its board \"who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk\".[514] The investors wrote that \"five of six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement.\"[515] Tesla's directors at the time included Brad Buss, who served as chief financial officer at SolarCity; Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who also sits on the board of SpaceX;[516] Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal; and Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias, both of whom also invested in SpaceX.[517] The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on groupthink.[515] At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the investors \"should buy Ford stock\" because \"their governance is amazing.\"[515] Two days later, he promised he would add two independent board members;[518] Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Larry Ellison were added at the end of 2018.[519] Ellison stepped down in August 2022.[520] Former Tesla CTO J. B. Straubel who left the company in 2019, was elected to the board in 2023.[521]\n\n\nAnother criticism of the board composition is that most of the independent directors lack automotive industry experience.[522] The exception is Robyn Denholm who served in finance and corporate reporting roles at Toyota Australia from 1989 to 1996.[523]\n\n\nOther previous board members include businessman Steve Westly; Daimler executive Herbert Kohler;[289] CEO and Chairman of Johnson Publishing Company Linda Johnson Rice;[524] and United Nations Special Envoy on Innovative Finance and Sustainable Investments Hiromichi Mizuno.[525][526]\n\n\nAs of May 2023[update], the board members are:[527]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Joined\n | Name\n | Titles\n | Independent |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014[528] | Robyn Denholm | Chair (since November 2018); former CFO and Head of Strategy of Telstra[523] | Yes\n |\n| 2004[18] | Elon Musk | CEO, product architect, former chairman; founder, CEO and CTO of SpaceX\n | No\n |\n| 2004[529] | Kimbal Musk | SpaceX board member[530] | No\n |\n| 2007[531] | Ira Ehrenpreis\n | General Partner at Technology Partners[524] | Disputed[514] |\n| 2017[524] | James Murdoch | Former CEO of 21st Century Fox[524] | Yes\n |\n| 2018[516] | Kathleen Wilson-Thompson | Global head of Human Resources of Walgreens Boots Alliance[516] | Yes\n |\n| 2022[532] | Joe Gebbia | Co-founder, board member and advisor of Airbnb[533] | Yes\n |\n| 2023[521] | J.

Nvidia is a dominant supplier of artificial intelligence hardware and software.[5][6] Its professional line of GPUs are used in workstations for applications in such fields as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design.[7]\n\n\nIn addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides an API called CUDA that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs.[8][9] They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world.[10][11] More recently, it has moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems.[12][13][14] Its competitors include AMD, Intel,[15] Qualcomm[16] and AI-accelerator companies such as Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing, e.g. Nvidia Maxine.[17]\n\n\nNvidia's GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and supercomputers. Nvidia expanded its presence in the gaming industry with its handheld game consoles Shield Portable, Shield Tablet, and Shield TV and its cloud gaming service GeForce Now.\n\n\nNvidia's offer to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Denny's roadside diner in East San Jose, c. 2023, where Nvidia's three co-founders agreed to start the company in 1993\n![](image)Aerial view of the new Nvidia headquarters building and surrounding campus and area in Santa Clara, California, in 2017. Apple Park is visible in the distance.\n![](image)Entrance of headquarters building in 2018\nNvidia was founded on April 5, 1993,[20][21][22] by Jensen Huang (CEO as of 2023[update]), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems.[23][24] The three men founded the company in a meeting at a Denny's roadside diner in East San Jose (just off Interstate 680 at the Berryessa Road interchange).[25]\n\n\nIn 1993, the trio of co-founders envisioned that the ideal trajectory for the forthcoming wave of computing lay in the realm of accelerated computing, specifically in graphics-based processing. This path was chosen due to its unique ability to tackle challenges that eluded general-purpose computing methods.[26] They also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume; the two conditions do not happen very often.[26] Video games became the company's flywheel to reach large markets and fund huge R&D to solve massive computational problems.[26] With $40,000 in the bank, the company was born.[26] The company subsequently received $20 million of venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital and others.[27] Nvidia initially had no name and the co-founders named all their files NV, as in \"next version\".[26] The need to incorporate the company prompted the co-founders to review all words with those two letters, leading them to \"invidia\", the Latin word for \"envy\".[26] The company's original headquarters office was in Sunnyvale, California.[26] Nvidia went public on January 22, 1999.[28][29][30]\n\n\n\n### Releases and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nThe release of the RIVA TNT in 1998, solidified Nvidia's reputation for developing capable graphics adapters. In late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), most notably introducing on-board transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.\n\n\nDue to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft's Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project took many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000. In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from the mid-1990s until 2000.[31][32] The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.[33]\n\n\nIn July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software-rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project.[34] In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million.[35] On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high-performance TCP/IP and iSCSI offload solutions.[36] In December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) in the PlayStation 3 game console. On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia's competitor.[37] In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[38] In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[39]\n\n\n*Forbes* named Nvidia its *Company of the Year* for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous five years.[40] On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc.[41] In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia, developer of the PhysX physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.[42][43]\n\n\nIn July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had \"abnormal failure rates\" due to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008, Nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September 2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or, in some cases, replacement.[44][45] On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-licensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.[46]\n\n\nIn November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its Tegra 3 ARM system-on-a-chip for mobile devices. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-core mobile CPU.[47][48] In May 2011, it was announced that NVIDIA had agreed to acquire Icera, a baseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million.[49] In January 2013, NVIDIA unveiled the Tegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new system-on-chip.[50] On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from STMicroelectronics.[51]\n\n\nIn 2014, Nvidia ported the Valve games Portal and Half Life 2 to its Nvidia Shield tablet as Lightspeed Studio.[52][53] Since 2014, Nvidia has diversified its business focusing on three markets: gaming, automotive electronics, and mobile devices.[54]\n\n\nOn May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GPUs of the GeForce 10 series, the GTX 1080 and 1070, based on the company's new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its Maxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and use a 16 nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as simultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and virtual reality rendering.[55][56][57] Laptops that include these GPUs and are sufficiently thin – as of late 2017, under 0.8 inches (20 mm) – have been designated as meeting NVIDIA's \"Max-Q\" design standard.[58]\n\n\nIn July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model, as the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4 GB of RAM due to limitations brought by the design of its hardware.[59] In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota which will use Nvidia's Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles.[60] In July 2017, Nvidia and Chinese search giant Baidu announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud computing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu's open-source AI framework PaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that Nvidia's Drive PX 2 AI will be the foundation of its autonomous-vehicle platform.[61]\n\n\nNvidia officially released the Titan V on December 7, 2017.[62][63]\n\n\nNvidia officially released the Nvidia Quadro GV100 on March 27, 2018.[64] Nvidia officially released the RTX 2080 GPUs on September 27, 2018. In 2018, Google announced that Nvidia's Tesla P4 graphic cards would be integrated into Google Cloud service's artificial intelligence.[65]\n\n\nIn May 2018, on the Nvidia user forum, a thread was started[66] asking the company to update users when they would release web drivers for its cards installed on legacy Mac Pro machines up to mid-2012 5,1 running the macOS Mojave operating system 10.14. Web drivers are required to enable graphics acceleration and multiple display monitor capabilities of the GPU. On its Mojave update info website, Apple stated that macOS Mojave would run on legacy machines with 'Metal compatible' graphics cards[67] and listed Metal compatible GPUs, including some manufactured by Nvidia.[68] However, this list did not include Metal compatible cards that currently work in macOS High Sierra using Nvidia-developed web drivers. In September, Nvidia responded, \"Apple fully controls drivers for Mac OS. But if Apple allows, our engineers are ready and eager to help Apple deliver great drivers for Mac OS 10.14 (Mojave).\"[69] In October, Nvidia followed this up with another public announcement, \"Apple fully controls drivers for Mac OS. Unfortunately, Nvidia currently cannot release a driver unless it is approved by Apple,\"[70] suggesting a possible rift between the two companies.[71] By January 2019, with still no sign of the enabling web drivers, Apple Insider weighed into the controversy with a claim that Apple management \"doesn't want Nvidia support in macOS\".[72] The following month, Apple Insider followed this up with another claim that Nvidia support was abandoned because of \"relational issues in the past\",[73] and that Apple was developing its own GPU technology.[74] Without Apple-approved Nvidia web drivers, Apple users are faced with replacing their Nvidia cards with a competing supported brand, such as AMD Radeon from the list recommended by Apple.[75]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nvidia Yokneam office (former Mellanox Technologies), Israel, March 2023\nOn March 11, 2019, Nvidia announced a deal to buy Mellanox Technologies for $6.9 billion[76] to substantially expand its footprint in the high-performance computing market. In May 2019, Nvidia announced new RTX Studio laptops. The creators say that the new laptop is going to be seven times faster than a top-end MacBook Pro with a Core i9 and AMD's Radeon Pro Vega 20 graphics in apps like Maya and RedCine-X Pro.[77] In August 2019, Nvidia announced *Minecraft RTX*, an official Nvidia-developed patch for the game *Minecraft* adding real-time DXR ray tracing exclusively to the Windows 10 version of the game. The whole game is, in Nvidia's words, \"refit\" with path tracing, which dramatically affects the way light, reflections, and shadows work inside the engine.[78]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Nvidia's top scientists developed an open-source ventilator to address the shortage resulting from the global coronavirus pandemic.[79] On May 14, 2020, Nvidia officially announced their Ampere GPU microarchitecture and the Nvidia A100 GPU accelerator.[80][81] In July 2020, it was reported that Nvidia was in talks with SoftBank to buy Arm, a UK-based chip designer, for $32 billion.[82]\n\n\nOn September 1, 2020, Nvidia officially announced the GeForce 30 series based on the company's new Ampere microarchitecture.[83][84]\n\n\nOn September 13, 2020, it was announced that Nvidia would buy Arm from SoftBank Group for $40 billion, subject to the usual scrutiny, with the latter retaining a 10% share of Nvidia.[85][86][87][88]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Nvidia announced its plan to build the most powerful computer in Cambridge, England. Named Cambridge-1, the computer will employ AI to support healthcare research, with an expected completion by the end of 2020, at a cost of approximately £40 million. According to Jensen Huang, \"The Cambridge-1 supercomputer will serve as a hub of innovation for the UK, and further the groundbreaking work being done by the nation's researchers in critical healthcare and drug discovery.\"[89]\n\n\nAlso in October 2020, along with the release of Nvidia RTX A6000, Nvidia announced it is retiring its workstation GPU brand Quadro, shifting its product name to Nvidia RTX for future products and the manufacturing to be Nvidia Ampere architecture based.[7]\n\n\nIn August 2021, the proposed takeover of Arm was stalled after the UK's Competition and Markets Authority raised \"significant competition concerns\".[90] In October 2021, the European Commission opened a competition investigation into the takeover. The Commission stated that Nvidia's acquisition could restrict competitors' access to Arm's products and provide Nvidia with too much internal information on its competitors due to their deals with Arm. SoftBank (the parent company of Arm) and Nvidia announced in early February 2022 that they \"had agreed not to move forward with the transaction 'because of significant regulatory challenges'\".[91] The investigation is set to end on March 15, 2022.[92][93] That same month, Nvidia was reportedly compromised by a cyberattack. The attack coincided with the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, though there is no indication that the attack came from Russia or Russian hackers.[94]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang mentioned that they are open to having Intel manufacture their chips in the future.[95] This was the first time the company mentioned that they would work together with Intel's upcoming foundry services.\n\n\nIn April 2022, it was reported that Nvidia planned to open a new research center in Yerevan, Armenia.[96]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Nvidia announced its next-generation automotive-grade chip, Drive Thor.[97][98]\n\n\nFollowing U.S. Department of Commerce regulations which placed an embargo on exports to China of advanced microchips, which went into effect in October 2022, Nvidia saw its data center chip added to the export control list. The next month, the company unveiled a new advanced chip in China, called the A800 GPU, that met the export control rules.[99]\n\n\nIn September 2023, Getty Images announced that it was partnering with Nvidia to launch Generative AI by Getty Images, a new tool that lets people create images using Getty's library of licensed photos. Getty will use Nvidia's Edify model, which is available on Nvidia's generative AI model library Picasso.[100]\n\n\nOn September 26, 2023, Denny's CEO Kelli Valade joined Huang in East San Jose to celebrate the founding of Nvidia at the Denny's on Berryessa Road, where a plaque was installed to mark the relevant corner booth.[101]\n\n\nIn October 2023, it was reported that Nvidia had quietly begun designing ARM-based central processing units (CPUs) for Microsoft`s Windows operating system with a target to start selling them in 2025.[102]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)NVIDIA Stock Price 1999-2023\nFor the fiscal year 2020, Nvidia reported earnings of US$2.796 billion, with an annual revenue of US$10.918 billion, a decline of 6.8% over the previous fiscal cycle. Nvidia's shares traded at over $531 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$328.7 billion in January 2021.[103]\n\n\nFor the Q2 of 2020, Nvidia reported sales of $3.87 billion, which was a 50% rise from the same period in 2019. The surge in sales and people's higher demand for computer technology. According to the financial chief of the company, Colette Kress, the effects of the pandemic will \"likely reflect this evolution in enterprise workforce trends with a greater focus on technologies, such as Nvidia laptops and virtual workstations, that enable remote work and virtual collaboration.\"[104]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year[103] | Revenuein mil.

Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open-source driver that only supports two-dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X.Org distribution.[116]\n\n\nThe proprietary nature of Nvidia's drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free-software communities.[117] Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open-source drivers and regard Nvidia's insistence on providing nothing more than a binary-only driver as inadequate, given that competing manufacturers such as Intel offer support and documentation for open-source developers and that others (like AMD) release partial documentation and provide some active development.[118][119]\n\n\nBecause of the closed nature of the drivers, Nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures, given that the company only provides x86/x64 and ARMv7-A driver builds.[120] As a result, support for 3D graphics acceleration in Linux on PowerPC does not exist, nor does support for Linux on the hypervisor-restricted PlayStation 3 console.\n\n\nSome users claim that Nvidia's Linux drivers impose artificial restrictions, like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time, but the company has not commented on these accusations.[121]\n\n\nIn 2014, with Maxwell GPUs, Nvidia started to require firmware by them to unlock all features of its graphics cards. Up to now, this state has not changed and makes writing open-source drivers difficult.[122][123][124]\n\n\nOn 12 May 2022, Nvidia announced that they are opensourcing their GPU kernel drivers. They are still maintaining closed source userland utilities, hence making users still dependent on their proprietary software.[125][126][127]\n\n\n\n## Deep learning[edit]\n\n\nNvidia GPUs are used in deep learning, and accelerated analytics due to Nvidia's API CUDA which allows programmers to utilize the higher number of cores present in GPUs to parallelize BLAS operations which are extensively used in machine learning algorithms.[9] They were included in many Tesla vehicles before Elon Musk announced at Tesla Autonomy Day in 2019 that the company developed its own SoC and full self-driving computer now and would stop using Nvidia hardware for their vehicles.[128][129] These GPUs are used by researchers, laboratories, tech companies and enterprise companies.[130] In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the \"big bang\" of deep learning, \"as deep-learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs)\".[131] That year, the Google Brain used Nvidia GPUs to create Deep Neural Networks capable of machine learning, where Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times.[132]\n\n\n\n### DGX[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nvidia DGX\n\nDGX is a line of supercomputers by Nvidia.\n\n\nIn April 2016, Nvidia produced the DGX-1 based on an 8 GPU cluster, to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining GPUs with integrated deep learning software.[133] Nvidia gifted its first DGX-1 to OpenAI in August 2016 to help it train larger and more complex AI models with the capability of reducing processing time from six days to two hours.[134][135] It also developed Nvidia Tesla K80 and P100 GPU-based virtual machines, which are available through Google Cloud, which Google installed in November 2016.[136] Microsoft added GPU servers in a preview offering of its N series based on Nvidia's Tesla K80s, each containing 4992 processing cores. Later that year, AWS's P2 instance was produced using up to 16 Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs. That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software kit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson,[137] called IBM PowerAI.[138][139] Nvidia also offers its own Nvidia Deep Learning software development kit.[140] In 2017, the GPUs were also brought online at the Riken Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu.[141] The company's deep learning technology led to a boost in its 2017 earnings.[142]\n\n\nIn May 2018, researchers at the artificial intelligence department of Nvidia realized the possibility that a robot can learn to perform a job simply by observing the person doing the same job. They have created a system that, after a short revision and testing, can already be used to control the universal robots of the next generation. In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications.[143]\n\n\n\n## Inception Program[edit]\n\n\nNvidia's **Inception Program** was created to support startups making exceptional advances in the fields of artificial intelligence and data science. Award winners are announced at Nvidia's GTC Conference. As of March 2018, there were 2,800 startups in the Inception Program. As of August 2021, Nvidia Inception has surpassed 8,500 members in 90 countries, with cumulative funding of US$60 billion.[144][145][146]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Maxwell advertising dispute[edit]\n\n\n#### GTX 970 hardware specifications[edit]\n\n\nIssues with the GeForce GTX 970's specifications were first brought up by users when they found out that the cards, while featuring 4 GB of memory, rarely accessed memory over the 3.5 GB boundary. Further testing and investigation eventually led to Nvidia issuing a statement that the card's initially announced specifications had been altered without notice before the card was made commercially available, and that the card took a performance hit once memory over the 3.5 GB limit were put into use.[147][148][149]\n\n\nThe card's back-end hardware specifications, initially announced as being identical to those of the GeForce GTX 980, differed in the amount of L2 cache (1.75 MB versus 2 MB in the GeForce GTX 980) and the number of ROPs (56 versus 64 in the 980). Additionally, it was revealed that the card was designed to access its memory as a 3.5 GB section, plus a 0.5 GB one, access to the latter being 7 times slower than the first one.[150] The company then went on to promise a specific driver modification in order to alleviate the performance issues produced by the cutbacks suffered by the card.[151] However, Nvidia later clarified that the promise had been a miscommunication and there would be no specific driver update for the GTX 970.[152] Nvidia claimed that it would assist customers who wanted refunds in obtaining them.[153] On February 26, 2015, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang went on record in Nvidia's official blog to apologize for the incident.[154] In February 2015 a class-action lawsuit alleging false advertising was filed against Nvidia and Gigabyte Technology in the U.S. District Court for Northern California.[155][156]\n\n\nNvidia revealed that it is able to disable individual units, each containing 256 KB of L2 cache and 8 ROPs, without disabling whole memory controllers.[157] This comes at the cost of dividing the memory bus into high speed and low speed segments that cannot be accessed at the same time unless one segment is reading while the other segment is writing because the L2/ROP unit managing both of the GDDR5 controllers shares the read return channel and the write data bus between the two GDDR5 controllers and itself.[157] This is used in the GeForce GTX 970, which therefore can be described as having 3.5 GB in its high speed segment on a 224-bit bus and 0.5 GB in a low speed segment on a 32-bit bus.[157]\n\n\nOn July 27, 2016, Nvidia agreed to a preliminary settlement of the U.S. class action lawsuit,[155] offering a $30 refund on GTX 970 purchases. The agreed upon refund represents the portion of the cost of the storage and performance capabilities the consumers assumed they were obtaining when they purchased the card.[158]\n\n\n\n#### Async compute support[edit]\n\n\nWhile the Maxwell series was marketed as fully DirectX 12 compliant,[159][160] Oxide Games, developer of *Ashes of the Singularity*, uncovered that Maxwell-based cards do not perform well when async compute is utilized.[161][162][163][159]\n\n\nIt appears that while this core feature is in fact exposed by the driver,[164] Nvidia partially implemented it through a driver-based shim, coming at a high performance cost.[163] Unlike AMD's competing GCN-based graphics cards which include a full implementation of hardware-based asynchronous compute,[165][166] Nvidia planned to rely on the driver to implement a software queue and a software distributor to forward asynchronous tasks to the hardware schedulers, capable of distributing the workload to the correct units.[167] Asynchronous compute on Maxwell therefore requires that both a game and the GPU driver be specifically coded for asynchronous compute on Maxwell in order to enable this capability.[168] The 3DMark Time Spy benchmark shows no noticeable performance difference between asynchronous compute being enabled or disabled.[168] Asynchronous compute is disabled by the driver for Maxwell.[168]\n\n\nOxide claims that this led to Nvidia pressuring them not to include the asynchronous compute feature in their benchmark at all, so that the 900 series would not be at a disadvantage against AMD's products which implement asynchronous compute in hardware.[162]\n\n\nMaxwell requires that the GPU be statically partitioned for asynchronous compute to allow tasks to run concurrently.[169] Each partition is assigned to a hardware queue. If any of the queues that are assigned to a partition empty out or are unable to submit work for any reason (e.g. a task in the queue must be delayed until a hazard is resolved), the partition and all of the resources in that partition reserved for that queue will idle.[169] Asynchronous compute therefore could easily hurt performance on Maxwell if it is not coded to work with Maxwell's static scheduler.[169] Furthermore, graphics tasks saturate Nvidia GPUs much more easily than they do to AMD's GCN-based GPUs which are much more heavily weighted towards compute, so Nvidia GPUs have fewer scheduling holes that could be filled by asynchronous compute than AMD's.[169] For these reasons, the driver forces a Maxwell GPU to place all tasks into one queue and execute each task in serial, and give each task the undivided resources of the GPU no matter whether or not each task can saturate the GPU or not.[169]\n\n\n\n### GeForce Partner Program[edit]\n\n\nMain article: GeForce Partner Program\nThe Nvidia GeForce Partner Program was a marketing program designed to provide partnering companies with benefits such as public relations support, video game bundling, and marketing development funds.[170] The program proved to be controversial, with complaints about it possibly being an anti-competitive practice.[171]\n\n\nFirst announced in a blog post on March 1, 2018,[172] it was canceled on May 4, 2018.[173]\n\n\n\n### Hardware Unboxed controversy[edit]\n\n\nOn December 10, 2020, Nvidia told popular YouTube tech reviewer Steven Walton of Hardware Unboxed that it would no longer supply him with GeForce Founders Edition graphics card review units.[174][175] In a Twitter message, Hardware Unboxed said, \"Nvidia have officially decided to ban us from receiving GeForce Founders Edition GPU review samples. Their reasoning is that we are focusing on rasterization instead of ray tracing. They have said they will revisit this 'should your editorial direction change.'\"[176]\n\n\n\nIn emails that were disclosed by Walton from Nvidia Senior PR Manager Bryan Del Rizzo, Nvidia had said:\n\n\n> ...your GPU reviews and recommendations have continued to focus singularly on rasterization performance, and you have largely discounted all of the other technologies we offer gamers. It is very clear from your community commentary that you do not see things the same way that we, gamers, and the rest of the industry do.[177]\n> \n> \n\nTechSpot, partner site of Hardware Unboxed, said, \"this and other related incidents raise serious questions around journalistic independence and what they are expecting of reviewers when they are sent products for an unbiased opinion.\"[177]\n\n\nA number of prominent technology reviewers came out strongly against Nvidia's move.[178][179] Linus Sebastian, of Linus Tech Tips, titled the episode of his popular weekly WAN Show, \"NVIDIA might ACTUALLY be EVIL...\"[180] and was highly critical of the company's move to dictate specific outcomes of technology reviews.[181] The popular review site Gamers Nexus said it was, \"Nvidia's latest decision to shoot both its feet: They've now made it so that any reviewers covering RT will become subject to scrutiny from untrusting viewers who will suspect subversion by the company. Shortsighted self-own from NVIDIA.\"[182]\n\n\nTwo days later, Nvidia reversed their stance.[183][184] Hardware Unboxed sent out a Twitter message, \"I just received an email from Nvidia apologizing for the previous email & they've now walked everything back.\"[185][178] On December 14, Hardware Unboxed released a video explaining the controversy from their viewpoint.[186] Via Twitter, they also shared a second apology sent by Nvidia's Del Rizzo that said \"to withhold samples because I didn't agree with your commentary is simply inexcusable and crossed the line.\"[187][188]\n\n\n\n### Improper disclosures about cryptomining[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Nvidia's chips became popular for cryptomining, the process of obtaining crypto rewards in exchange for verifying transactions on distributed ledgers, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said. However, the company failed to disclose that it was a \"significant element\" of its revenue growth from sales of chips designed for gaming, the SEC further added in a statement and charging order. Those omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of cryptomining on Nvidia's business, the SEC emphasized. Nvidia, which did not admit or deny the findings, has agreed to pay $5.5 million to settle civil charges, according to a statement made by the SEC in May 2022.[189]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Fast approximate anti-aliasing\n* General-purpose computing on graphics processing units\n* Nvidia G-Sync\n* Huang's law\n* List of Nvidia 3D Vision Ready games\n* List of Nvidia graphics processing units\n* Molecular modeling on GPUs\n* Nvision\n* Nvidia Ion\n* Nvidia ShadowPlay\n* OpenCL\n* OptiX\n* Project Denver\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Officially written as **NVIDIA** and stylized in its logo as **n****VIDIA** with the lowercase \"n\" the same height as the uppercase \"VIDIA\"; formerly stylized as ***n*****VIDIA** with a large italicized lowercase \"n\" on products from the mid 1990s to early-mid 2000s. \"NVIDIA Logo Guidelines at a Glance\" (PDF). *nvidia.com*.

Nvidia is a dominant supplier of artificial intelligence hardware and software.[5][6] Its professional line of GPUs are used in workstations for applications in such fields as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design.[7]\n\n\nIn addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides an API called CUDA that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs.[8][9] They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world.[10][11] More recently, it has moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems.[12][13][14] Its competitors include AMD, Intel,[15] Qualcomm[16] and AI-accelerator companies such as Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing, e.g. Nvidia Maxine.[17]\n\n\nNvidia's GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and supercomputers. Nvidia expanded its presence in the gaming industry with its handheld game consoles Shield Portable, Shield Tablet, and Shield TV and its cloud gaming service GeForce Now.\n\n\nNvidia's offer to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Denny's roadside diner in East San Jose, c. 2023, where Nvidia's three co-founders agreed to start the company in 1993\n![](image)Aerial view of the new Nvidia headquarters building and surrounding campus and area in Santa Clara, California, in 2017. Apple Park is visible in the distance.\n![](image)Entrance of headquarters building in 2018\nNvidia was founded on April 5, 1993,[20][21][22] by Jensen Huang (CEO as of 2023[update]), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems.[23][24] The three men founded the company in a meeting at a Denny's roadside diner in East San Jose (just off Interstate 680 at the Berryessa Road interchange).[25]\n\n\nIn 1993, the trio of co-founders envisioned that the ideal trajectory for the forthcoming wave of computing lay in the realm of accelerated computing, specifically in graphics-based processing. This path was chosen due to its unique ability to tackle challenges that eluded general-purpose computing methods.[26] They also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume; the two conditions do not happen very often.[26] Video games became the company's flywheel to reach large markets and fund huge R&D to solve massive computational problems.[26] With $40,000 in the bank, the company was born.[26] The company subsequently received $20 million of venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital and others.[27] Nvidia initially had no name and the co-founders named all their files NV, as in \"next version\".[26] The need to incorporate the company prompted the co-founders to review all words with those two letters, leading them to \"invidia\", the Latin word for \"envy\".[26] The company's original headquarters office was in Sunnyvale, California.[26] Nvidia went public on January 22, 1999.[28][29][30]\n\n\n\n### Releases and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nThe release of the RIVA TNT in 1998, solidified Nvidia's reputation for developing capable graphics adapters. In late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), most notably introducing on-board transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.\n\n\nDue to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft's Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project took many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000. In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from the mid-1990s until 2000.[31][32] The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.[33]\n\n\nIn July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software-rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project.[34] In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million.[35] On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high-performance TCP/IP and iSCSI offload solutions.[36] In December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) in the PlayStation 3 game console. On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia's competitor.[37] In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[38] In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[39]\n\n\n*Forbes* named Nvidia its *Company of the Year* for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous five years.[40] On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc.[41] In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia, developer of the PhysX physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.[42][43]\n\n\nIn July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had \"abnormal failure rates\" due to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008, Nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September 2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or, in some cases, replacement.[44][45] On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-licensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.[46]\n\n\nIn November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its Tegra 3 ARM system-on-a-chip for mobile devices. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-core mobile CPU.[47][48] In May 2011, it was announced that NVIDIA had agreed to acquire Icera, a baseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million.[49] In January 2013, NVIDIA unveiled the Tegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new system-on-chip.[50] On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from STMicroelectronics.[51]\n\n\nIn 2014, Nvidia ported the Valve games Portal and Half Life 2 to its Nvidia Shield tablet as Lightspeed Studio.[52][53] Since 2014, Nvidia has diversified its business focusing on three markets: gaming, automotive electronics, and mobile devices.[54]\n\n\nOn May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GPUs of the GeForce 10 series, the GTX 1080 and 1070, based on the company's new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its Maxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and use a 16 nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as simultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and virtual reality rendering.[55][56][57] Laptops that include these GPUs and are sufficiently thin – as of late 2017, under 0.8 inches (20 mm) – have been designated as meeting NVIDIA's \"Max-Q\" design standard.[58]\n\n\nIn July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model, as the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4 GB of RAM due to limitations brought by the design of its hardware.[59] In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota which will use Nvidia's Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles.[60] In July 2017, Nvidia and Chinese search giant Baidu announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud computing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu's open-source AI framework PaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that Nvidia's Drive PX 2 AI will be the foundation of its autonomous-vehicle platform.[61]\n\n\nNvidia officially released the Titan V on December 7, 2017.[62][63]\n\n\nNvidia officially released the Nvidia Quadro GV100 on March 27, 2018.[64] Nvidia officially released the RTX 2080 GPUs on September 27, 2018. In 2018, Google announced that Nvidia's Tesla P4 graphic cards would be integrated into Google Cloud service's artificial intelligence.[65]\n\n\nIn May 2018, on the Nvidia user forum, a thread was started[66] asking the company to update users when they would release web drivers for its cards installed on legacy Mac Pro machines up to mid-2012 5,1 running the macOS Mojave operating system 10.14. Web drivers are required to enable graphics acceleration and multiple display monitor capabilities of the GPU. On its Mojave update info website, Apple stated that macOS Mojave would run on legacy machines with 'Metal compatible' graphics cards[67] and listed Metal compatible GPUs, including some manufactured by Nvidia.[68] However, this list did not include Metal compatible cards that currently work in macOS High Sierra using Nvidia-developed web drivers. In September, Nvidia responded, \"Apple fully controls drivers for Mac OS. But if Apple allows, our engineers are ready and eager to help Apple deliver great drivers for Mac OS 10.14 (Mojave).\"[69] In October, Nvidia followed this up with another public announcement, \"Apple fully controls drivers for Mac OS. Unfortunately, Nvidia currently cannot release a driver unless it is approved by Apple,\"[70] suggesting a possible rift between the two companies.[71] By January 2019, with still no sign of the enabling web drivers, Apple Insider weighed into the controversy with a claim that Apple management \"doesn't want Nvidia support in macOS\".[72] The following month, Apple Insider followed this up with another claim that Nvidia support was abandoned because of \"relational issues in the past\",[73] and that Apple was developing its own GPU technology.[74] Without Apple-approved Nvidia web drivers, Apple users are faced with replacing their Nvidia cards with a competing supported brand, such as AMD Radeon from the list recommended by Apple.[75]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nvidia Yokneam office (former Mellanox Technologies), Israel, March 2023\nOn March 11, 2019, Nvidia announced a deal to buy Mellanox Technologies for $6.9 billion[76] to substantially expand its footprint in the high-performance computing market. In May 2019, Nvidia announced new RTX Studio laptops. The creators say that the new laptop is going to be seven times faster than a top-end MacBook Pro with a Core i9 and AMD's Radeon Pro Vega 20 graphics in apps like Maya and RedCine-X Pro.[77] In August 2019, Nvidia announced *Minecraft RTX*, an official Nvidia-developed patch for the game *Minecraft* adding real-time DXR ray tracing exclusively to the Windows 10 version of the game. The whole game is, in Nvidia's words, \"refit\" with path tracing, which dramatically affects the way light, reflections, and shadows work inside the engine.[78]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Nvidia's top scientists developed an open-source ventilator to address the shortage resulting from the global coronavirus pandemic.[79] On May 14, 2020, Nvidia officially announced their Ampere GPU microarchitecture and the Nvidia A100 GPU accelerator.[80][81] In July 2020, it was reported that Nvidia was in talks with SoftBank to buy Arm, a UK-based chip designer, for $32 billion.[82]\n\n\nOn September 1, 2020, Nvidia officially announced the GeForce 30 series based on the company's new Ampere microarchitecture.[83][84]\n\n\nOn September 13, 2020, it was announced that Nvidia would buy Arm from SoftBank Group for $40 billion, subject to the usual scrutiny, with the latter retaining a 10% share of Nvidia.[85][86][87][88]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Nvidia announced its plan to build the most powerful computer in Cambridge, England. Named Cambridge-1, the computer will employ AI to support healthcare research, with an expected completion by the end of 2020, at a cost of approximately £40 million. According to Jensen Huang, \"The Cambridge-1 supercomputer will serve as a hub of innovation for the UK, and further the groundbreaking work being done by the nation's researchers in critical healthcare and drug discovery.\"[89]\n\n\nAlso in October 2020, along with the release of Nvidia RTX A6000, Nvidia announced it is retiring its workstation GPU brand Quadro, shifting its product name to Nvidia RTX for future products and the manufacturing to be Nvidia Ampere architecture based.[7]\n\n\nIn August 2021, the proposed takeover of Arm was stalled after the UK's Competition and Markets Authority raised \"significant competition concerns\".[90] In October 2021, the European Commission opened a competition investigation into the takeover. The Commission stated that Nvidia's acquisition could restrict competitors' access to Arm's products and provide Nvidia with too much internal information on its competitors due to their deals with Arm. SoftBank (the parent company of Arm) and Nvidia announced in early February 2022 that they \"had agreed not to move forward with the transaction 'because of significant regulatory challenges'\".[91] The investigation is set to end on March 15, 2022.[92][93] That same month, Nvidia was reportedly compromised by a cyberattack. The attack coincided with the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, though there is no indication that the attack came from Russia or Russian hackers.[94]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang mentioned that they are open to having Intel manufacture their chips in the future.[95] This was the first time the company mentioned that they would work together with Intel's upcoming foundry services.\n\n\nIn April 2022, it was reported that Nvidia planned to open a new research center in Yerevan, Armenia.[96]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Nvidia announced its next-generation automotive-grade chip, Drive Thor.[97][98]\n\n\nFollowing U.S. Department of Commerce regulations which placed an embargo on exports to China of advanced microchips, which went into effect in October 2022, Nvidia saw its data center chip added to the export control list. The next month, the company unveiled a new advanced chip in China, called the A800 GPU, that met the export control rules.[99]\n\n\nIn September 2023, Getty Images announced that it was partnering with Nvidia to launch Generative AI by Getty Images, a new tool that lets people create images using Getty's library of licensed photos. Getty will use Nvidia's Edify model, which is available on Nvidia's generative AI model library Picasso.[100]\n\n\nOn September 26, 2023, Denny's CEO Kelli Valade joined Huang in East San Jose to celebrate the founding of Nvidia at the Denny's on Berryessa Road, where a plaque was installed to mark the relevant corner booth.[101]\n\n\nIn October 2023, it was reported that Nvidia had quietly begun designing ARM-based central processing units (CPUs) for Microsoft`s Windows operating system with a target to start selling them in 2025.[102]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)NVIDIA Stock Price 1999-2023\nFor the fiscal year 2020, Nvidia reported earnings of US$2.796 billion, with an annual revenue of US$10.918 billion, a decline of 6.8% over the previous fiscal cycle. Nvidia's shares traded at over $531 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$328.7 billion in January 2021.[103]\n\n\nFor the Q2 of 2020, Nvidia reported sales of $3.87 billion, which was a 50% rise from the same period in 2019. The surge in sales and people's higher demand for computer technology. According to the financial chief of the company, Colette Kress, the effects of the pandemic will \"likely reflect this evolution in enterprise workforce trends with a greater focus on technologies, such as Nvidia laptops and virtual workstations, that enable remote work and virtual collaboration.\"[104]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year[103] | Revenuein mil.

Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open-source driver that only supports two-dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X.Org distribution.[116]\n\n\nThe proprietary nature of Nvidia's drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free-software communities.[117] Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open-source drivers and regard Nvidia's insistence on providing nothing more than a binary-only driver as inadequate, given that competing manufacturers such as Intel offer support and documentation for open-source developers and that others (like AMD) release partial documentation and provide some active development.[118][119]\n\n\nBecause of the closed nature of the drivers, Nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures, given that the company only provides x86/x64 and ARMv7-A driver builds.[120] As a result, support for 3D graphics acceleration in Linux on PowerPC does not exist, nor does support for Linux on the hypervisor-restricted PlayStation 3 console.\n\n\nSome users claim that Nvidia's Linux drivers impose artificial restrictions, like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time, but the company has not commented on these accusations.[121]\n\n\nIn 2014, with Maxwell GPUs, Nvidia started to require firmware by them to unlock all features of its graphics cards. Up to now, this state has not changed and makes writing open-source drivers difficult.[122][123][124]\n\n\nOn 12 May 2022, Nvidia announced that they are opensourcing their GPU kernel drivers. They are still maintaining closed source userland utilities, hence making users still dependent on their proprietary software.[125][126][127]\n\n\n\n## Deep learning[edit]\n\n\nNvidia GPUs are used in deep learning, and accelerated analytics due to Nvidia's API CUDA which allows programmers to utilize the higher number of cores present in GPUs to parallelize BLAS operations which are extensively used in machine learning algorithms.[9] They were included in many Tesla vehicles before Elon Musk announced at Tesla Autonomy Day in 2019 that the company developed its own SoC and full self-driving computer now and would stop using Nvidia hardware for their vehicles.[128][129] These GPUs are used by researchers, laboratories, tech companies and enterprise companies.[130] In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the \"big bang\" of deep learning, \"as deep-learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs)\".[131] That year, the Google Brain used Nvidia GPUs to create Deep Neural Networks capable of machine learning, where Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times.[132]\n\n\n\n### DGX[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nvidia DGX\n\nDGX is a line of supercomputers by Nvidia.\n\n\nIn April 2016, Nvidia produced the DGX-1 based on an 8 GPU cluster, to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining GPUs with integrated deep learning software.[133] Nvidia gifted its first DGX-1 to OpenAI in August 2016 to help it train larger and more complex AI models with the capability of reducing processing time from six days to two hours.[134][135] It also developed Nvidia Tesla K80 and P100 GPU-based virtual machines, which are available through Google Cloud, which Google installed in November 2016.[136] Microsoft added GPU servers in a preview offering of its N series based on Nvidia's Tesla K80s, each containing 4992 processing cores. Later that year, AWS's P2 instance was produced using up to 16 Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs. That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software kit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson,[137] called IBM PowerAI.[138][139] Nvidia also offers its own Nvidia Deep Learning software development kit.[140] In 2017, the GPUs were also brought online at the Riken Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu.[141] The company's deep learning technology led to a boost in its 2017 earnings.[142]\n\n\nIn May 2018, researchers at the artificial intelligence department of Nvidia realized the possibility that a robot can learn to perform a job simply by observing the person doing the same job. They have created a system that, after a short revision and testing, can already be used to control the universal robots of the next generation. In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications.[143]\n\n\n\n## Inception Program[edit]\n\n\nNvidia's **Inception Program** was created to support startups making exceptional advances in the fields of artificial intelligence and data science. Award winners are announced at Nvidia's GTC Conference. As of March 2018, there were 2,800 startups in the Inception Program. As of August 2021, Nvidia Inception has surpassed 8,500 members in 90 countries, with cumulative funding of US$60 billion.[144][145][146]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Maxwell advertising dispute[edit]\n\n\n#### GTX 970 hardware specifications[edit]\n\n\nIssues with the GeForce GTX 970's specifications were first brought up by users when they found out that the cards, while featuring 4 GB of memory, rarely accessed memory over the 3.5 GB boundary. Further testing and investigation eventually led to Nvidia issuing a statement that the card's initially announced specifications had been altered without notice before the card was made commercially available, and that the card took a performance hit once memory over the 3.5 GB limit were put into use.[147][148][149]\n\n\nThe card's back-end hardware specifications, initially announced as being identical to those of the GeForce GTX 980, differed in the amount of L2 cache (1.75 MB versus 2 MB in the GeForce GTX 980) and the number of ROPs (56 versus 64 in the 980). Additionally, it was revealed that the card was designed to access its memory as a 3.5 GB section, plus a 0.5 GB one, access to the latter being 7 times slower than the first one.[150] The company then went on to promise a specific driver modification in order to alleviate the performance issues produced by the cutbacks suffered by the card.[151] However, Nvidia later clarified that the promise had been a miscommunication and there would be no specific driver update for the GTX 970.[152] Nvidia claimed that it would assist customers who wanted refunds in obtaining them.[153] On February 26, 2015, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang went on record in Nvidia's official blog to apologize for the incident.[154] In February 2015 a class-action lawsuit alleging false advertising was filed against Nvidia and Gigabyte Technology in the U.S. District Court for Northern California.[155][156]\n\n\nNvidia revealed that it is able to disable individual units, each containing 256 KB of L2 cache and 8 ROPs, without disabling whole memory controllers.[157] This comes at the cost of dividing the memory bus into high speed and low speed segments that cannot be accessed at the same time unless one segment is reading while the other segment is writing because the L2/ROP unit managing both of the GDDR5 controllers shares the read return channel and the write data bus between the two GDDR5 controllers and itself.[157] This is used in the GeForce GTX 970, which therefore can be described as having 3.5 GB in its high speed segment on a 224-bit bus and 0.5 GB in a low speed segment on a 32-bit bus.[157]\n\n\nOn July 27, 2016, Nvidia agreed to a preliminary settlement of the U.S. class action lawsuit,[155] offering a $30 refund on GTX 970 purchases. The agreed upon refund represents the portion of the cost of the storage and performance capabilities the consumers assumed they were obtaining when they purchased the card.[158]\n\n\n\n#### Async compute support[edit]\n\n\nWhile the Maxwell series was marketed as fully DirectX 12 compliant,[159][160] Oxide Games, developer of *Ashes of the Singularity*, uncovered that Maxwell-based cards do not perform well when async compute is utilized.[161][162][163][159]\n\n\nIt appears that while this core feature is in fact exposed by the driver,[164] Nvidia partially implemented it through a driver-based shim, coming at a high performance cost.[163] Unlike AMD's competing GCN-based graphics cards which include a full implementation of hardware-based asynchronous compute,[165][166] Nvidia planned to rely on the driver to implement a software queue and a software distributor to forward asynchronous tasks to the hardware schedulers, capable of distributing the workload to the correct units.[167] Asynchronous compute on Maxwell therefore requires that both a game and the GPU driver be specifically coded for asynchronous compute on Maxwell in order to enable this capability.[168] The 3DMark Time Spy benchmark shows no noticeable performance difference between asynchronous compute being enabled or disabled.[168] Asynchronous compute is disabled by the driver for Maxwell.[168]\n\n\nOxide claims that this led to Nvidia pressuring them not to include the asynchronous compute feature in their benchmark at all, so that the 900 series would not be at a disadvantage against AMD's products which implement asynchronous compute in hardware.[162]\n\n\nMaxwell requires that the GPU be statically partitioned for asynchronous compute to allow tasks to run concurrently.[169] Each partition is assigned to a hardware queue. If any of the queues that are assigned to a partition empty out or are unable to submit work for any reason (e.g. a task in the queue must be delayed until a hazard is resolved), the partition and all of the resources in that partition reserved for that queue will idle.[169] Asynchronous compute therefore could easily hurt performance on Maxwell if it is not coded to work with Maxwell's static scheduler.[169] Furthermore, graphics tasks saturate Nvidia GPUs much more easily than they do to AMD's GCN-based GPUs which are much more heavily weighted towards compute, so Nvidia GPUs have fewer scheduling holes that could be filled by asynchronous compute than AMD's.[169] For these reasons, the driver forces a Maxwell GPU to place all tasks into one queue and execute each task in serial, and give each task the undivided resources of the GPU no matter whether or not each task can saturate the GPU or not.[169]\n\n\n\n### GeForce Partner Program[edit]\n\n\nMain article: GeForce Partner Program\nThe Nvidia GeForce Partner Program was a marketing program designed to provide partnering companies with benefits such as public relations support, video game bundling, and marketing development funds.[170] The program proved to be controversial, with complaints about it possibly being an anti-competitive practice.[171]\n\n\nFirst announced in a blog post on March 1, 2018,[172] it was canceled on May 4, 2018.[173]\n\n\n\n### Hardware Unboxed controversy[edit]\n\n\nOn December 10, 2020, Nvidia told popular YouTube tech reviewer Steven Walton of Hardware Unboxed that it would no longer supply him with GeForce Founders Edition graphics card review units.[174][175] In a Twitter message, Hardware Unboxed said, \"Nvidia have officially decided to ban us from receiving GeForce Founders Edition GPU review samples. Their reasoning is that we are focusing on rasterization instead of ray tracing. They have said they will revisit this 'should your editorial direction change.'\"[176]\n\n\n\nIn emails that were disclosed by Walton from Nvidia Senior PR Manager Bryan Del Rizzo, Nvidia had said:\n\n\n> ...your GPU reviews and recommendations have continued to focus singularly on rasterization performance, and you have largely discounted all of the other technologies we offer gamers. It is very clear from your community commentary that you do not see things the same way that we, gamers, and the rest of the industry do.[177]\n> \n> \n\nTechSpot, partner site of Hardware Unboxed, said, \"this and other related incidents raise serious questions around journalistic independence and what they are expecting of reviewers when they are sent products for an unbiased opinion.\"[177]\n\n\nA number of prominent technology reviewers came out strongly against Nvidia's move.[178][179] Linus Sebastian, of Linus Tech Tips, titled the episode of his popular weekly WAN Show, \"NVIDIA might ACTUALLY be EVIL...\"[180] and was highly critical of the company's move to dictate specific outcomes of technology reviews.[181] The popular review site Gamers Nexus said it was, \"Nvidia's latest decision to shoot both its feet: They've now made it so that any reviewers covering RT will become subject to scrutiny from untrusting viewers who will suspect subversion by the company. Shortsighted self-own from NVIDIA.\"[182]\n\n\nTwo days later, Nvidia reversed their stance.[183][184] Hardware Unboxed sent out a Twitter message, \"I just received an email from Nvidia apologizing for the previous email & they've now walked everything back.\"[185][178] On December 14, Hardware Unboxed released a video explaining the controversy from their viewpoint.[186] Via Twitter, they also shared a second apology sent by Nvidia's Del Rizzo that said \"to withhold samples because I didn't agree with your commentary is simply inexcusable and crossed the line.\"[187][188]\n\n\n\n### Improper disclosures about cryptomining[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Nvidia's chips became popular for cryptomining, the process of obtaining crypto rewards in exchange for verifying transactions on distributed ledgers, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said. However, the company failed to disclose that it was a \"significant element\" of its revenue growth from sales of chips designed for gaming, the SEC further added in a statement and charging order. Those omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of cryptomining on Nvidia's business, the SEC emphasized. Nvidia, which did not admit or deny the findings, has agreed to pay $5.5 million to settle civil charges, according to a statement made by the SEC in May 2022.[189]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Fast approximate anti-aliasing\n* General-purpose computing on graphics processing units\n* Nvidia G-Sync\n* Huang's law\n* List of Nvidia 3D Vision Ready games\n* List of Nvidia graphics processing units\n* Molecular modeling on GPUs\n* Nvision\n* Nvidia Ion\n* Nvidia ShadowPlay\n* OpenCL\n* OptiX\n* Project Denver\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Officially written as **NVIDIA** and stylized in its logo as **n****VIDIA** with the lowercase \"n\" the same height as the uppercase \"VIDIA\"; formerly stylized as ***n*****VIDIA** with a large italicized lowercase \"n\" on products from the mid 1990s to early-mid 2000s. \"NVIDIA Logo Guidelines at a Glance\" (PDF). *nvidia.com*.
