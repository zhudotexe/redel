Allentown's warmest month (on average) is July with a daily average temperature of 74.7 °F (23.7 °C) and the coldest month (on average) being January with a daily average of 29.4 °F (−1.4 °C). The average precipitation of Allentown is 45.35 inches (1,152 mm) per year. \n\n\nAllentown occasionally has some severe weather, mostly thunderstorms and flooding. Winters can bring snow, with some years receiving very little of it while others seeing several major snowstorms, often Nor'easters. Winter also brings the more dangerous ice, sleet, and freezing rain, which has caused several traffic accidents over the years. Tropical storms and hurricanes occasionally survive up the coast of the Atlantic Ocean and cross into Pennsylvania. Storms such as Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 caused light to severe damage in Allentown and its surrounding suburbs.\n\n\n\n\n## Average temperatures[edit]\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for Allentown, Pennsylvania at Lehigh Valley International Airport, 1991–2020 normals,[a] extremes 1922–present[b]\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 72(22)\n | 81(27)\n | 87(31)\n | 93(34)\n | 97(36)\n | 100(38)\n | 105(41)\n | 100(38)\n | 99(37)\n | 93(34)\n | 81(27)\n | 72(22)\n | 105(41)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 60.2(15.7)\n | 60.6(15.9)\n | 70.6(21.4)\n | 83.2(28.4)\n | 89.3(31.8)\n | 92.6(33.7)\n | 94.8(34.9)\n | 92.8(33.8)\n | 89.2(31.8)\n | 80.4(26.9)\n | 70.9(21.6)\n | 61.7(16.5)\n | 95.9(35.5)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 38.4(3.6)\n | 41.6(5.3)\n | 50.8(10.4)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n | 73.5(23.1)\n | 81.9(27.7)\n | 86.4(30.2)\n | 84.3(29.1)\n | 77.4(25.2)\n | 65.5(18.6)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 43.1(6.2)\n | 63.3(17.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 30.1(−1.1)\n | 32.4(0.2)\n | 40.7(4.8)\n | 51.8(11.0)\n | 62.0(16.7)\n | 70.9(21.6)\n | 75.6(24.2)\n | 73.6(23.1)\n | 66.3(19.1)\n | 54.6(12.6)\n | 43.9(6.6)\n | 35.0(1.7)\n | 53.1(11.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 21.8(−5.7)\n | 23.2(−4.9)\n | 30.5(−0.8)\n | 40.3(4.6)\n | 50.6(10.3)\n | 59.9(15.5)\n | 64.7(18.2)\n | 62.8(17.1)\n | 55.2(12.9)\n | 43.8(6.6)\n | 34.1(1.2)\n | 26.8(−2.9)\n | 42.8(6.0)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 4.2(−15.4)\n | 5.9(−14.5)\n | 14.1(−9.9)\n | 25.9(−3.4)\n | 35.3(1.8)\n | 46.5(8.1)\n | 53.7(12.1)\n | 51.1(10.6)\n | 39.9(4.4)\n | 28.7(−1.8)\n | 19.1(−7.2)\n | 11.7(−11.3)\n | 1.8(−16.8)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −15(−26)\n | −12(−24)\n | −5(−21)\n | 12(−11)\n | 28(−2)\n | 39(4)\n | 46(8)\n | 41(5)\n | 30(−1)\n | 21(−6)\n | 3(−16)\n | −8(−22)\n | −15(−26)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 3.30(84)\n | 2.77(70)\n | 3.63(92)\n | 3.67(93)\n | 3.65(93)\n | 4.40(112)\n | 5.30(135)\n | 4.56(116)\n | 4.84(123)\n | 4.14(105)\n | 3.24(82)\n | 3.86(98)\n | 47.36(1,203)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 9.8(25)\n | 10.8(27)\n | 6.3(16)\n | 0.5(1.3)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.2(0.51)\n | 0.9(2.3)\n | 4.6(12)\n | 33.1(84)\n |\n| Average extreme snow depth inches (cm)\n | 6.4(16)\n | 7.9(20)\n | 4.9(12)\n | 0.3(0.76)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.2(0.51)\n | 0.6(1.5)\n | 2.9(7.4)\n | 12.4(31)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 11.4\n | 10.1\n | 10.9\n | 11.8\n | 12.4\n | 11.4\n | 11.0\n | 10.2\n | 9.6\n | 9.9\n | 8.9\n | 11.5\n | 129.1\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 5.1\n | 4.3\n | 2.6\n | 0.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.5\n | 2.9\n | 15.7\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 70\n | 66\n | 62\n | 61\n | 66\n | 68\n | 70\n | 72\n | 74\n | 72\n | 70\n | 71\n | 69\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 43\n | 48\n | 53\n | 47\n | 54\n | 63\n | 57\n | 56\n | 54\n | 53\n | 45\n | 42\n | 51\n |\n| Source: NOAA (relative humidity 1981–2010)[1][2][3] |\n\n## Extremes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An Allentown snow storm in 1918\n[[F\n\n![](image)Hamilton and Front Streets in Center City Allentown during the 1942 Allentown floodile:1933 - Phoenix Mills Flood.jpg|thumb|The Great Flood of Allentown in 1933]]\n\n\n![](image)A winter snow storm in Allentown in 2016\nAllentown began maintaining weather records in 1922. Records from 1922 to date include:[4]\n\n\n\n### Temperature[edit]\n\n\n* Highest recorded temperature: 105 °F (41 °C) on July 3, 1966\n* Lowest daily maximum temperature: 2 °F (−17 °C) on January 19, 1994\n* Highest daily minimum temperature: 79 °F (26 °C) on July 15, 1995\n* Lowest recorded temperature: −15 °F (−26 °C) on January 21, 1994\n* Highest daily average temperature: 91.0 °F (32.8 °C) on July 22, 2011\n* Lowest daily average temperature: −4.5 °F (−20.3 °C) on January 19, 1994\n\n\n### Precipitation and snow[edit]\n\n\n* Most precipitation in 24 hours: 8.71 in (221.2 mm) October 8, 2005\n* Heaviest 24-hour snowfall: 24.0 in (61.0 cm) on February 11, 1983\n* Greatest daily snow depth: 28 in (71 cm) on February 12, 1983\n\n\n## Summer[edit]\n\n\nSummers in Allentown and the surrounding Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania are hot and very humid, with temperatures in the mid-80s and low-90s. The average high temperature peaks at 84 °F (29 °C), but highs can often surpass that, with the all-time record high standing at 105 °F (41 °C). Humidity is often around 80 percent, which is a drastic change for someone living in the Southwest United States. Rain is common, and is often accompanied by strong or severe thunderstorms. These will cause quite a large amount of rain, but they do not last long at all. Air conditioning is popular among most households in the summer months, because high temperatures and high humidity can make the air feel much warmer than the actual temperature.\n\n\n\n## Autumn[edit]\n\n\nAutumn is fairly mild, with daytime temperatures in the 70s and 60s. Autumn brings more wind, and sometimes heavier rainfall. Trees begin to lose their leaves before the cold winter season. Indian summer may occur.\n\n\n\n## Winter[edit]\n\n\nWinters are cool to cold, with January's high temperature at 35 °F (2 °C). The highest temperature recorded was 76 °F (24 °C) in February, 87 °F (31 °C) in March, and 72 °F (22 °C) in both December and January. Snowfall is common, with amounts varying greatly between seasons. Snow, ice, sleet, and freezing rain can cause road problems and school closures. In February 2007, Interstate Highway 78 was closed just west of the city. Drivers were stranded on the stretch of highway for as much as 24 hours, with overturned tractor trailers blocking the way. Winter sports are popular, such as snowboarding and skiing, and they can be enjoyed in the Pocono Mountains, just north of the Lehigh Valley.\n\n\n\n## Spring[edit]\n\n\nSpring is a season of growth, with new grass growing and flowers blooming. Animals come out of hibernation, and sun fills the city and its surroundings. Temperatures are on the rise, but March and April bring much rain, with light rain that can last for hours on end. That gives way to warm May and June months, and shore weather is in the forecast for many residents.\n\n\n\n## Natural disasters[edit]\n\n\nHurricanes, tropical storms, and Tropical Depressions are all summer threats. Severe thunderstorms are an even bigger threat, and can cause flash flooding. When flash flooding occurs, mudslides are rare but are possible. Tornadoes and earthquakes are also rare but have been reported. Blizzards occur approximately ever every ten or fifteen years.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lehigh Valley\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1981 to 2010.\n2. **^** Official records for Allentown were kept at Allentown Gas Company from March 1922 to December 1943, and at Lehigh Valley Int'l since January 1944.

Allentown's warmest month (on average) is July with a daily average temperature of 74.7 °F (23.7 °C) and the coldest month (on average) being January with a daily average of 29.4 °F (−1.4 °C). The average precipitation of Allentown is 45.35 inches (1,152 mm) per year. \n\n\nAllentown occasionally has some severe weather, mostly thunderstorms and flooding. Winters can bring snow, with some years receiving very little of it while others seeing several major snowstorms, often Nor'easters. Winter also brings the more dangerous ice, sleet, and freezing rain, which has caused several traffic accidents over the years. Tropical storms and hurricanes occasionally survive up the coast of the Atlantic Ocean and cross into Pennsylvania. Storms such as Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 caused light to severe damage in Allentown and its surrounding suburbs.\n\n\n\n\n## Average temperatures[edit]\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for Allentown, Pennsylvania at Lehigh Valley International Airport, 1991–2020 normals,[a] extremes 1922–present[b]\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 72(22)\n | 81(27)\n | 87(31)\n | 93(34)\n | 97(36)\n | 100(38)\n | 105(41)\n | 100(38)\n | 99(37)\n | 93(34)\n | 81(27)\n | 72(22)\n | 105(41)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 60.2(15.7)\n | 60.6(15.9)\n | 70.6(21.4)\n | 83.2(28.4)\n | 89.3(31.8)\n | 92.6(33.7)\n | 94.8(34.9)\n | 92.8(33.8)\n | 89.2(31.8)\n | 80.4(26.9)\n | 70.9(21.6)\n | 61.7(16.5)\n | 95.9(35.5)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 38.4(3.6)\n | 41.6(5.3)\n | 50.8(10.4)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n | 73.5(23.1)\n | 81.9(27.7)\n | 86.4(30.2)\n | 84.3(29.1)\n | 77.4(25.2)\n | 65.5(18.6)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 43.1(6.2)\n | 63.3(17.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 30.1(−1.1)\n | 32.4(0.2)\n | 40.7(4.8)\n | 51.8(11.0)\n | 62.0(16.7)\n | 70.9(21.6)\n | 75.6(24.2)\n | 73.6(23.1)\n | 66.3(19.1)\n | 54.6(12.6)\n | 43.9(6.6)\n | 35.0(1.7)\n | 53.1(11.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 21.8(−5.7)\n | 23.2(−4.9)\n | 30.5(−0.8)\n | 40.3(4.6)\n | 50.6(10.3)\n | 59.9(15.5)\n | 64.7(18.2)\n | 62.8(17.1)\n | 55.2(12.9)\n | 43.8(6.6)\n | 34.1(1.2)\n | 26.8(−2.9)\n | 42.8(6.0)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 4.2(−15.4)\n | 5.9(−14.5)\n | 14.1(−9.9)\n | 25.9(−3.4)\n | 35.3(1.8)\n | 46.5(8.1)\n | 53.7(12.1)\n | 51.1(10.6)\n | 39.9(4.4)\n | 28.7(−1.8)\n | 19.1(−7.2)\n | 11.7(−11.3)\n | 1.8(−16.8)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −15(−26)\n | −12(−24)\n | −5(−21)\n | 12(−11)\n | 28(−2)\n | 39(4)\n | 46(8)\n | 41(5)\n | 30(−1)\n | 21(−6)\n | 3(−16)\n | −8(−22)\n | −15(−26)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 3.30(84)\n | 2.77(70)\n | 3.63(92)\n | 3.67(93)\n | 3.65(93)\n | 4.40(112)\n | 5.30(135)\n | 4.56(116)\n | 4.84(123)\n | 4.14(105)\n | 3.24(82)\n | 3.86(98)\n | 47.36(1,203)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 9.8(25)\n | 10.8(27)\n | 6.3(16)\n | 0.5(1.3)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.2(0.51)\n | 0.9(2.3)\n | 4.6(12)\n | 33.1(84)\n |\n| Average extreme snow depth inches (cm)\n | 6.4(16)\n | 7.9(20)\n | 4.9(12)\n | 0.3(0.76)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.2(0.51)\n | 0.6(1.5)\n | 2.9(7.4)\n | 12.4(31)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 11.4\n | 10.1\n | 10.9\n | 11.8\n | 12.4\n | 11.4\n | 11.0\n | 10.2\n | 9.6\n | 9.9\n | 8.9\n | 11.5\n | 129.1\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 5.1\n | 4.3\n | 2.6\n | 0.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.5\n | 2.9\n | 15.7\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 70\n | 66\n | 62\n | 61\n | 66\n | 68\n | 70\n | 72\n | 74\n | 72\n | 70\n | 71\n | 69\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 43\n | 48\n | 53\n | 47\n | 54\n | 63\n | 57\n | 56\n | 54\n | 53\n | 45\n | 42\n | 51\n |\n| Source: NOAA (relative humidity 1981–2010)[1][2][3] |\n\n## Extremes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An Allentown snow storm in 1918\n[[F\n\n![](image)Hamilton and Front Streets in Center City Allentown during the 1942 Allentown floodile:1933 - Phoenix Mills Flood.jpg|thumb|The Great Flood of Allentown in 1933]]\n\n\n![](image)A winter snow storm in Allentown in 2016\nAllentown began maintaining weather records in 1922. Records from 1922 to date include:[4]\n\n\n\n### Temperature[edit]\n\n\n* Highest recorded temperature: 105 °F (41 °C) on July 3, 1966\n* Lowest daily maximum temperature: 2 °F (−17 °C) on January 19, 1994\n* Highest daily minimum temperature: 79 °F (26 °C) on July 15, 1995\n* Lowest recorded temperature: −15 °F (−26 °C) on January 21, 1994\n* Highest daily average temperature: 91.0 °F (32.8 °C) on July 22, 2011\n* Lowest daily average temperature: −4.5 °F (−20.3 °C) on January 19, 1994\n\n\n### Precipitation and snow[edit]\n\n\n* Most precipitation in 24 hours: 8.71 in (221.2 mm) October 8, 2005\n* Heaviest 24-hour snowfall: 24.0 in (61.0 cm) on February 11, 1983\n* Greatest daily snow depth: 28 in (71 cm) on February 12, 1983\n\n\n## Summer[edit]\n\n\nSummers in Allentown and the surrounding Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania are hot and very humid, with temperatures in the mid-80s and low-90s. The average high temperature peaks at 84 °F (29 °C), but highs can often surpass that, with the all-time record high standing at 105 °F (41 °C). Humidity is often around 80 percent, which is a drastic change for someone living in the Southwest United States. Rain is common, and is often accompanied by strong or severe thunderstorms. These will cause quite a large amount of rain, but they do not last long at all. Air conditioning is popular among most households in the summer months, because high temperatures and high humidity can make the air feel much warmer than the actual temperature.\n\n\n\n## Autumn[edit]\n\n\nAutumn is fairly mild, with daytime temperatures in the 70s and 60s. Autumn brings more wind, and sometimes heavier rainfall. Trees begin to lose their leaves before the cold winter season. Indian summer may occur.\n\n\n\n## Winter[edit]\n\n\nWinters are cool to cold, with January's high temperature at 35 °F (2 °C). The highest temperature recorded was 76 °F (24 °C) in February, 87 °F (31 °C) in March, and 72 °F (22 °C) in both December and January. Snowfall is common, with amounts varying greatly between seasons. Snow, ice, sleet, and freezing rain can cause road problems and school closures. In February 2007, Interstate Highway 78 was closed just west of the city. Drivers were stranded on the stretch of highway for as much as 24 hours, with overturned tractor trailers blocking the way. Winter sports are popular, such as snowboarding and skiing, and they can be enjoyed in the Pocono Mountains, just north of the Lehigh Valley.\n\n\n\n## Spring[edit]\n\n\nSpring is a season of growth, with new grass growing and flowers blooming. Animals come out of hibernation, and sun fills the city and its surroundings. Temperatures are on the rise, but March and April bring much rain, with light rain that can last for hours on end. That gives way to warm May and June months, and shore weather is in the forecast for many residents.\n\n\n\n## Natural disasters[edit]\n\n\nHurricanes, tropical storms, and Tropical Depressions are all summer threats. Severe thunderstorms are an even bigger threat, and can cause flash flooding. When flash flooding occurs, mudslides are rare but are possible. Tornadoes and earthquakes are also rare but have been reported. Blizzards occur approximately ever every ten or fifteen years.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lehigh Valley\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1981 to 2010.\n2. **^** Official records for Allentown were kept at Allentown Gas Company from March 1922 to December 1943, and at Lehigh Valley Int'l since January 1944.

It is one of the most historically significant cities in the United States and served as the nation's capital until 1800.[13] Philadelphia is the nation's sixth-most populous city with a population of 1,603,797 as of the 2020 census. Since 1854, the city has been coextensive with Philadelphia County, the most populous county in Pennsylvania. Philadelphia serves as the urban core of the larger Delaware Valley (or Philadelphia metropolitan area), the nation's seventh-largest and one of the world's largest metropolitan regions consisting of 6.245 million residents in the metropolitan statistical area and 7.366 million residents in its combined statistical area.[14] Philadelphia is known for its extensive contributions to American history, especially the American Revolution, and for its contemporary influence in business and industry, culture, sports, and music.[15][16]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was founded in 1682 by William Penn, an English Quaker and advocate of religious freedom. The city served as the capital of the Pennsylvania Colony during the British colonial era[5][17] and went on to play a historic and vital role as the central meeting place for the nation's founding fathers whose plans and actions in Philadelphia ultimately inspired the American Revolution and the nation's independence following the Revolutionary War. Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress in 1774, preserved the Liberty Bell, and hosted the Second Continental Congress during which the founders signed the Declaration of Independence, which historian Joseph Ellis has described as \"the most potent and consequential words in American history\".[18] Once the Revolutionary War commenced, the Battle of Germantown and the siege of Fort Mifflin were fought within Philadelphia's city limits. The U.S. Constitution was later ratified in Philadelphia at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until 1790, when it was surpassed by New York City, and it served as the nation's first capital from May 10, 1775, until December 12, 1776, and on four subsequent occasions during and following the American Revolution, including from 1790 to 1800 during the construction of the new national capital of Washington, D.C.\n\n\nWith 18 four-year universities and colleges, Philadelphia is one of the nation's leading centers for higher education and academic research.[19][20] As of 2018[update], the Philadelphia metropolitan area was the state's largest and nation's ninth-largest metropolitan economy with a gross metropolitan product of US$444.1 billion. The city is home to five Fortune 500 corporate headquarters as of 2022.[21] As of 2023, metropolitan Philadelphia ranks among the top five U.S. venture capital centers, facilitated by its proximity to New York City's entrepreneurial and financial ecosystems.[22] The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, owned by Nasdaq since 2008, is the nation's oldest stock exchange and a global leader in options trading.[23] 30th Street Station, the city's primary rail station, is the third-busiest Amtrak hub in the nation, and the city's multimodal transport and logistics infrastructure, includes Philadelphia International Airport, and the rapidly-growing PhilaPort seaport.[24] A migration pattern has been established from New York City to Philadelphia by residents opting for a large city with relative proximity and a lower cost of living.[25][26]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a national cultural center, hosting more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other city in the nation.[27][28] Fairmount Park, when combined with adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park in the same watershed, is 2,052 acres (830 ha), representing one of the nation's largest and the world's 45th-largest urban park.[29] The city is known for its arts, culture, cuisine, and colonial and Revolution-era history; in 2016, it attracted 42 million domestic tourists who spent $6.8 billion, representing $11 billion in economic impact to the city and its surrounding Pennsylvania counties.[30]\n\n\nWith five professional sports teams and one of the nation's most loyal fan bases, Philadelphia is often ranked as the nation's best city for professional sports fans.[31][32][33][34] The city has a culturally and philanthropically active LGBTQ+ community. Philadelphia also has played an immensely influential historic and ongoing role in the development and evolution of American music, especially R&B, soul, and rock.[35][36]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a city of many firsts, including the nation's first library (1731),[37] hospital (1751),[37] medical school (1765),[38] national capital (1774),[39] university (by some accounts) (1779),[40] stock exchange (1790),[37] zoo (1874),[41] and business school (1881).[42] Philadelphia contains 67 National Historic Landmarks, including Independence Hall.[43][44][20] From the city's 17th century founding through the present, Philadelphia has been the birthplace or home to an extensive number of prominent and influential Americans. In 2021, *Time* magazine named Philadelphia one of the world's greatest 100 places.[45]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Philadelphia\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Philadelphia.\n\nSee also: List of National Historic Landmarks in Philadelphia and National Register of Historic Places listings in Philadelphia\n\n### Native peoples[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 17th century, the Philadelphia area was home to the Lenape (Delaware) Indians in the village of Shackamaxon. They were also called the Delaware Indians,[46] and their historical territory was along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley.[a] Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts.[46] Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly smallpox, and conflict with Europeans. The Iroquois occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper Ohio River basin. The American Revolutionary War and the United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory to present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territories under the Indian removal policy.\n\n\n\n### Colonial[edit]\n\n\n![](image)William Penn (holding paper) and King Charles II depicted in *The Birth of Pennsylvania*, an 1680 portrait by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris\n![A Portraiture of the City of Philadelphia, by Thomas Holme](image)A 1683 portrait of Philadelphia by Thomas Holme that is believed to be the city's first map\n![](image)William Penn's 1682 Treaty of Shackamaxon with the Lenape tribe depicted in *Penn's Treaty with the Indians*, a 1772 portrait by Benjamin West\nEuropeans came to the Delaware Valley in the early 17th century. The first settlements were founded by Dutch colonists, who built Fort Nassau on the Delaware River in 1623 in what is now Brooklawn, New Jersey. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their New Netherland colony. In 1638, Swedish settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of New Sweden at Fort Christina, located in present-day Wilmington, Delaware, and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the Susquehannocks in their war against Maryland colonists.[47] In 1648, the Dutch built Fort Beversreede on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill River near the present-day Eastwick section of Philadelphia, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building Fort Nya Korsholm, or New Korsholm, named after a town in Finland with a Swedish majority. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General Peter Stuyvesant took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence. The Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. An English fleet captured the New Netherland colony in 1664, though the situation did not change substantially until 1682, when the area was included in William Penn's charter for Pennsylvania.[48]\n\n\nIn 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, Charles II of England granted Penn a charter for what would become the Pennsylvania colony. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape in an effort to establish good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for the colony.[49] Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon, in what is now the city's Fishtown neighborhood.[5] Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for \"brotherly love\", derived from the Ancient Greek terms φίλος *phílos* (beloved, dear) and ἀδελφός *adelphós* (brother, brotherly). There were a number of cities named *Philadelphia* in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Greek and Roman periods, including modern Alaşehir, mentioned as the site of an early Christian congregation in the Book of Revelation. As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, which exceeded that of other colonies, led to better relations with the local native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city.[50]\n\n\nPenn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a grid plan to keep houses and businesses spread far apart with areas for gardens and orchards.\n\n\nThe city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, however, and instead crowded the present-day Port of Philadelphia on the Delaware River and subdivided and resold their lots.[51] Before Penn left Philadelphia for the final time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city. Though poor at first, Philadelphia became an important trading center with tolerable living conditions by the 1750s. Benjamin Franklin, a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones that were among the first in the nation, including a fire company, library, and hospital.\n\n\nA number of philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life, including the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the Academy of Natural Sciences (1812), and the Franklin Institute (1824).[52] These societies developed and financed new industries that attracted skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe.\n\n\n\n### American Revolution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution and Philadelphia campaign\n\n![](image)The Committee of Five presenting their draft of the Declaration of Independence in Independence Hall on June 28, 1776, depicted in an 1818 painting by John Trumbull; historian Joseph Ellis called the Declaration \"the most potent and consequential words in American history.\"[53]\n![](image)President's House on Market Street served as the presidential mansion for the nation's first two presidents, George Washington and John Adams, from 1790 to 1800 prior to the completion of the White House and the development of Washington, D.C. as the nation's new capital\n![](image)Independence Hall on Chestnut Street between 5th and 6th Streets, where the Declaration of Independence was signed and the Constitution was ratified, on July 4, 1776, and June 21, 1788, respectively\nPhiladelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for America's revolutionaries. By the 1750s, Philadelphia surpassed Boston as the largest city and busiest port in British America, and the second-largest city in the entire British Empire after London.[54][55] In 1774, as resentment of British colonial practices and support for independence was burgeoning in the colonies, Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress.\n\n\nFrom 1775 to 1781, Philadelphia hosted the Second Continental Congress,[56] which adopted the Declaration of Independence in what was then called the Pennsylvania State House and was later renamed Independence Hall. Historian Joseph Ellis, in 2007, described the Declaration of Independence, written predominantly by Thomas Jefferson, as \"the most potent and consequential words in American history,\"[18] and its adoption represented a declaration of war against the British Army, which was then the world's most powerful military force. Since the Declaration's July 4, 1776, adoption, its signing has been cited globally and repeatedly by various peoples of the world seeking independence and liberty. It also has been, since its adoption, the basis for annual celebration by Americans; in 1938, this celebration of the Declaration was formalized as Independence Day, one of only ten designated U.S. federal holidays.\n\n\nAfter George Washington's defeat at the Battle of Brandywine in Chadds Ford Township, on September 11, 1777, during the Philadelphia campaign, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless and the city prepared for what was perceived to be an inevitable British attack. Because bells could easily be recast into munitions, the Liberty Bell, then known as the Pennsylvania State Bell, and bells from two Philadelphia churches, Christ Church and St. Peter's Church, were hastily taken down and transported by heavily guarded wagon train out of the city. The Liberty Bell was taken to Zion German Reformed Church in Northampton Town, which is present-day Allentown, where it was hidden under the church's floor boards for nine months from September 1777 until the British Army's departure from Philadelphia in June 1778.[57] Two Revolutionary War battles, the Siege of Fort Mifflin, fought between September 26 and November 16, 1777, and the Battle of Germantown, fought on October 4, 1777, took place within Philadelphia's city limits.\n\n\nIn Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation on November 15, 1777, and the city later served as the meeting place for the Constitutional Convention, which ratified the Constitution in Independence Hall in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787.\n\n\nPhiladelphia served as capital of the United States for much of the colonial and early post-colonial periods, including for a decade, from 1790 to 1800, while Washington, D.C., was being constructed and prepared to serve as the new national capital.[58] In 1793, the largest yellow fever epidemic in U.S. history killed approximately 4,000 to 5,000 people in Philadelphia, or about ten percent of the city's population at the time.[59][60] The capital of the United States was moved to Washington, D.C. in 1800 upon completion of the White House and U.S. Capitol buildings.\n\n\nThe state capital was moved from Philadelphia to Lancaster in 1799, then ultimately to Harrisburg in 1812 Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until the late 18th century. It also was the nation's financial and cultural center until ultimately being eclipsed in total population by New York City in 1790. In 1816, the city's free Black community founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent Black denomination in the country, and the first Black Episcopal Church. The free Black community also established many schools for its children with the help of Quakers. Large-scale construction projects for new roads, canals, and railroads made Philadelphia the first major industrial city in the United States.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\n![](image)Loan of the City of Philadelphia, issued March 7, 1866\n![](image)Opening day ceremonies at the Centennial Exposition at Memorial Hall in Fairmount Park in 1876, the first world fair held in the U.S. on the centennial anniversary of the nation's founding\nThroughout the 19th century, Philadelphia hosted a variety of industries and businesses; the largest was the textile industry. Major corporations in the 19th and early 20th centuries included the Baldwin Locomotive Works, William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company, and the Pennsylvania Railroad.[61] Established in 1870, the Philadelphia Conveyancers' Association was chartered by the state in 1871. Along with the U.S. Centennial in 1876, the city's industry was celebrated in the Centennial Exposition, the first official World's fair in the U.S.\n\n\nImmigrants, mostly from Ireland and Germany, settled in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts. These immigrants were largely responsible for the first general strike in North America in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday. The city was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine in the 1840s; housing for them was developed south of South Street and later occupied by succeeding immigrants. They established a network of Catholic churches and schools and dominated the Catholic clergy for decades. Anti-Irish, anti-Catholic nativist riots erupted in Philadelphia in 1844. The rise in population of the surrounding districts helped lead to the Act of Consolidation of 1854, which extended the city limits from the 2 square miles (5.2 km2) of Center City to the roughly 134 square miles (350 km2) of Philadelphia County.[62][63]\nIn the latter half of the 19th century and leading into the 20th century, immigrants from Russia, Eastern Europe, and Italy, and African Americans from the southern U.S. settled in the city.[64]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was represented by the Washington Grays in the American Civil War. The African-American population of Philadelphia increased from 31,699 to 219,559 between 1880 and 1930.[65][66] Black newcomers in the 20th century were part of the Great Migration out of the rural south and into northern and midwestern industrial cities.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chestnut Street in Center City at night in February 2016\nBy the 20th century, Philadelphia had an entrenched Republican political machine and a complacent population.[67] In 1910, a general strike shut down the entire city.[68]\n\n\nIn 1917, following outrage over the election-year murder of a Philadelphia police officer, led to the shrinking of the City Council from two houses to just one.[69] In July 1919, Philadelphia was one of more than 36 industrial cities nationally to suffer a race riot during Red Summer in post-World War I unrest as recent immigrants competed with Blacks for jobs. In the 1920s, the public flouting of Prohibition laws, organized crime, mob violence, and corrupt police involvement in illegal activities led to the appointment of Brig. Gen. Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps as the city's director of public safety, but political pressure still prevented long-term success in fighting crime and corruption.[70]\n\n\nIn 1940, non-Hispanic whites constituted 86.8% of the city's population.[71] In 1950, the population peaked at more than two million residents, then began to decline with the restructuring of industry that led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs. In addition, suburbanization enticed many affluent residents to depart the city for its outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. The resulting reduction in Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government caused the city to struggle through a long period of adjustment, and it approached bankruptcy by the late 1980s.[72][73]\n\n\nIn 1985, the MOVE Bombing of the Cobbs Creek neighborhood by city helicopters occurred, killing 11 and destroying 61 homes.[74]\n\n\nRevitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century with much of the development occurring in the Center City and University City neighborhoods. But this expanded a shortage of affordable housing in the city. After many manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down, the city started attracting service businesses and began to market itself more aggressively as a tourist destination. Contemporary glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the 1980s. Historic areas such as Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s, making both areas among the most desirable Center City neighborhoods. Immigrants from around the world began to enter the U.S. through Philadelphia as their gateway, leading to a reversal of the city's population decline between 1950 and 2000, during which it lost about 25 percent of its residents.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia eventually began experiencing a growth in its population in 2007, which continued with gradual yearly increases through the present.[77][78]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's geographic center is about 40° 0′ 34″ north latitude and 75° 8′ 0″ west longitude. The 40th parallel north passes through neighborhoods in Northeast Philadelphia, North Philadelphia, and West Philadelphia including Fairmount Park. The city encompasses 142.71 square miles (369.62 km2), of which 134.18 square miles (347.52 km2) is land and 8.53 square miles (22.09 km2), or 6%, is water.[79] Natural bodies of water include the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, lakes in Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park, and Cobbs, Wissahickon, and Pennypack creeks. The largest artificial body of water is East Park Reservoir in Fairmount Park.\n\n\nThe lowest point is sea level and the highest point is in Chestnut Hill about 446 feet (136 m) above sea level on Summit Street near the intersection of Germantown Avenue and Bethlehem Pike at: 40.07815 N, 75.20747 W.[80][81] Philadelphia is located on the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line that separates the Atlantic Plain from the Piedmont.[82] The Schuylkill River's rapids at East Falls were inundated by completion of the dam at Fairmount Water Works.[83]\n\n\nThe city is the seat of its own county. The city is bordered by six adjacent counties: Montgomery to the northwest; Bucks to the north and northeast; Burlington County, New Jersey to the east; Camden County, New Jersey to the southeast; Gloucester County, New Jersey to the south; and Delaware County to the southwest.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of Philadelphia and List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)\nThe skyline of Philadelphia seen from the northwest on the Spring Garden Street Bridge over the Schuylkill River in April 2018 (annotated version)\n\n![](image)\nPhiladelphia's skyline at twilight from the southwest on the South Street Bridge with the Schuylkill River on the left in July 2016 (annotated version)\n\n#### City planning[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Philadelphia neighborhoods\n\nPhiladelphia was created in the 17th century following the plan by William Penn's surveyor Thomas Holme. Center City is structured with long, straight streets running nearly due east–west and north–south, forming a grid pattern between the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers that is aligned with their courses. The original city plan was designed to allow for easy travel and to keep residences separated by open space that would help prevent the spread of fire.[84] In keeping with the idea of a \"Greene Countrie Towne\", and inspired by the many types of trees that grew in the region, Penn named many of the east–west streets for local trees.[85] Penn planned the creation of five public parks in the city which were renamed in 1824.[84] Centre Square was renamed Penn Square;[86] Northeast Square was renamed Franklin Square; Southeast Square was renamed Washington Square; Southwest Square was renamed Rittenhouse Square; and Northwest Square was renamed Logan Circle/Square.[87] Center City had an estimated 183,240 residents as of 2015[update], making it the second-most populated downtown area in the United States after Midtown Manhattan in New York City.[88]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's neighborhoods are divided into six large sections that surround Center City: North Philadelphia, Northeast Philadelphia, South Philadelphia, Southwest Philadelphia, West Philadelphia, and Northwest Philadelphia. The city's geographic boundaries have been largely unchanged since these neighborhoods were consolidated in 1854. However, each of these large areas contains numerous neighborhoods, some of whose boundaries derive from the boroughs, townships, and other communities that constituted Pennsylvania County before their inclusion within the city.[89]\n\n\nThe City Planning Commission, tasked with guiding growth and development of the city, has divided the city into 18 planning districts as part of the *Philadelphia2035* physical development plan.[90][91] Much of the city's 1980 zoning code was overhauled from 2007 to 2012 as part of a joint effort between former mayors John F. Street and Michael Nutter. The zoning changes were intended to rectify incorrect zoning maps to facilitate future community development, as the city forecasts an additional 100,000 residents and 40,000 jobs will be added by 2035.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) is the largest landlord in Pennsylvania. Established in 1937, the PHA is the nation's fourth-largest housing authority, serving about 81,000 people with affordable housing, while employing 1,400 on a budget of $371 million.[92] The Philadelphia Parking Authority is responsible for ensuring adequate parking for city residents, businesses, and visitors.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Architecture of Philadelphia and List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Philadelphia City Hall at night in December 2012\n![](image)Two of Center City Philadelphia's most prominent high-rise buildings, One Liberty Place, built between 1985 and 1987 (in background), and Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901 (in foreground)\nPhiladelphia's architectural history dates back to colonial times and includes a wide range of styles. The earliest structures were constructed with logs, but brick structures were common by 1700. During the 18th century, the cityscape was dominated by Georgian architecture, including Independence Hall and Christ Church.\n\n\nIn the first decades of the 19th century, Federal and Greek Revival architecture were the dominant styles produced by Philadelphia architects such as Benjamin Latrobe, William Strickland, John Haviland, John Notman, Thomas Walter, and Samuel Sloan.[94] Frank Furness is considered Philadelphia's greatest architect of the second half of the 19th century. His contemporaries included John McArthur Jr., Addison Hutton, Wilson Eyre, the Wilson Brothers, and Horace Trumbauer. In 1871, construction began on the Second Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall. The Philadelphia Historical Commission was created in 1955 to preserve the cultural and architectural history of the city. The commission maintains the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places, adding historic buildings, structures, sites, objects and districts as it sees fit.[95]\n\n\nIn 1932, Philadelphia became home to the first modern International Style skyscraper in the United States, the PSFS Building, designed by George Howe and William Lescaze. The 548 ft (167 m) City Hall remained the tallest building in the city until 1987 when One Liberty Place was completed. Numerous glass and granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the late 1980s. In 2007, the Comcast Center surpassed One Liberty Place to become the city's tallest building. The Comcast Technology Center was completed in 2018, reaching a height of 1,121 ft (342 m), as the tallest building in the United States outside of Manhattan and Chicago.[96]\n\n\nFor much of Philadelphia's history, the typical home has been the row house. The row house was introduced to the United States via Philadelphia in the early 19th century and, for a time, row houses built elsewhere in the United States were known as \"Philadelphia rows\".[94] A variety of row houses are found throughout the city, from Federal-style continuous blocks in Old City and Society Hill to Victorian-style homes in North Philadelphia to twin row houses in West Philadelphia. While newer homes have been built recently, much of the housing dates to the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, which has created problems such as urban decay and vacant lots. Some neighborhoods, including Northern Liberties and Society Hill, have been rehabilitated through gentrification.[97][98]\n\n\n\n* ![Elfreth's Alley, first developed in 1703, is the nation's oldest residential street.[99]](image)\n\nElfreth's Alley, first developed in 1703, is the nation's oldest residential street.[99]\n* ![Carpenters' Hall, built between 1770 and 1774 in Georgian architecture style](image)\n\nCarpenters' Hall, built between 1770 and 1774 in Georgian architecture style\n* ![The Second Bank of the United States, built between 1818 and 1824, exhibiting Greek Revival architecture](image)\n\nThe Second Bank of the United States, built between 1818 and 1824, exhibiting Greek Revival architecture\n* ![Second Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901, on South Broad Street](image)\n\nSecond Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901, on South Broad Street\n* ![The Art Deco-style grand concourse at 30th Street Station, one of the nation's busiest passenber train stations, built between 1927 and 1933](image)\n\nThe Art Deco-style grand concourse at 30th Street Station, one of the nation's busiest passenber train stations, built between 1927 and 1933\n\n\n#### Parks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Drinking fountains in Philadelphia, Fairmount Park, and List of parks in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's Fairmount Park on the Schuylkill River, the city's largest and one of the world's largest public parks\nAs of 2014[update], the city's total park space, including municipal, state, and federal parks in the city, amounts to 11,211 acres (17.5 sq mi).[29] Philadelphia's largest park is Fairmount Park, which includes the Philadelphia Zoo and encompasses 2,052 acres (3.2 sq mi) of the total parkland. Fairmount Park's adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park contains 2,042 acres (3.2 sq mi).[100] Fairmount Park, when combined with Wissahickon Valley Park, is one of the largest contiguous urban park areas in the U.S.[29] The two parks, along with the Colonial Revival, Georgian and Federal-style mansions in them, have been listed as one entity on the National Register of Historic Places since 1972.[101]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 3.1\n\n\n\n41\n\n26\n | 2.8\n\n\n\n44\n\n28\n | 4\n\n\n\n53\n\n34\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n65\n\n44\n | 3.3\n\n\n\n74\n\n54\n | 4\n\n\n\n83\n\n64\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n88\n\n70\n | 4.3\n\n\n\n86\n\n68\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n79\n\n61\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n67\n\n49\n | 2.9\n\n\n\n56\n\n39\n | 4\n\n\n\n46\n\n31\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Metric conversion |\n| --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 80\n\n\n\n5\n\n−3\n | 70\n\n\n\n7\n\n−3\n | 101\n\n\n\n12\n\n1\n | 88\n\n\n\n18\n\n7\n | 85\n\n\n\n24\n\n12\n | 103\n\n\n\n28\n\n18\n | 111\n\n\n\n31\n\n21\n | 109\n\n\n\n30\n\n20\n | 112\n\n\n\n26\n\n16\n | 88\n\n\n\n20\n\n10\n | 74\n\n\n\n13\n\n4\n | 101\n\n\n\n8\n\n0\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification, Philadelphia falls under the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen *Cfa*),[102] whereas according to the Trewartha climate classification, the city has a temperate maritime climate (*Do*) limited to the north by the continental climate (*Dc*).[103] Summers are typically hot and muggy, fall and spring are generally mild, and winter is moderately cold. The plant life hardiness zones are 7a and 7b, representing an average annual extreme minimum temperature between 0 and 10 °F (−18 and −12 °C).[104]\n\n\nSnowfall is highly variable, with some winters experiencing only light snow, while others include major snowstorms. The normal seasonal snowfall averages 22.4 in (57 cm), with rare snowfalls in November or April, and rarely any sustained snow cover.[105] Seasonal snowfall accumulation has ranged from trace amounts in 1972–73 to 78.7 inches (200 cm) in the winter of 2009–10.[105][b] The city's heaviest single-storm snowfall was 30.7 in (78 cm) which occurred in January 1996.[106]\n\n\nPrecipitation is generally spread throughout the year, with eight to eleven wet days per month,[107] at an average annual rate of 44.1 inches (1,120 mm), but historically ranging from 29.31 in (744 mm) in 1922 to 64.33 in (1,634 mm) in 2011.[105] The most rain recorded in one day occurred on July 28, 2013, when 8.02 in (204 mm) fell at Philadelphia International Airport.[105] Philadelphia has a moderately sunny climate with an average of 2,498 hours of sunshine annually, and a percentage of sunshine ranging from 47% in December to 61% in June, July, and August.[108]\n\n\nThe January daily average temperature is 33.7 °F (0.9 °C), though the temperature frequently rises to 50 °F (10 °C) during thaws. July averages 78.7 °F (25.9 °C), although heat waves accompanied by high humidity and heat indices are frequent, with highs reaching or exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) on 30 days of the year. The average window for freezing temperatures is November 6 thru April 2,[105] allowing a growing season of 217 days. Early fall and late winter are generally dry with February having the lowest average precipitation at 2.75 inches (70 mm). The dewpoint in the summer averages between 59.1 and 64.5 °F (15 and 18 °C).[105]\n\n\nThe highest recorded temperature was 106 °F (41 °C) on August 7, 1918, but temperatures at or above 100 °F (38 °C) are not common, with the last occurrence of such a temperature was July 21, 2019.[109] The lowest officially recorded temperature was −11 °F (−24 °C) on February 9, 1934.[109] Temperatures at or below 0 °F (−18 °C) are rare with the last such occurrence being January 19, 1994.[105] The record low maximum is 5 °F (−15 °C) on February 10, 1899, and December 30, 1880, while the record high minimum is 83 °F (28 °C) on July 23, 2011, and July 24, 2010.[110]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for Philadelphia (Philadelphia Airport), 1991–2020 normals,[c] extremes 1872–present[d]\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 74(23)\n | 79(26)\n | 87(31)\n | 95(35)\n | 97(36)\n | 102(39)\n | 104(40)\n | 106(41)\n | 102(39)\n | 96(36)\n | 84(29)\n | 73(23)\n | 106(41)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 63.3(17.4)\n | 63.5(17.5)\n | 73.8(23.2)\n | 84.3(29.1)\n | 90.2(32.3)\n | 94.8(34.9)\n | 97.1(36.2)\n | 94.8(34.9)\n | 90.6(32.6)\n | 82.6(28.1)\n | 72.4(22.4)\n | 64.2(17.9)\n | 98.1(36.7)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 41.3(5.2)\n | 44.3(6.8)\n | 52.8(11.6)\n | 64.7(18.2)\n | 74.4(23.6)\n | 83.2(28.4)\n | 87.8(31.0)\n | 85.8(29.9)\n | 78.9(26.1)\n | 67.2(19.6)\n | 55.9(13.3)\n | 46.0(7.8)\n | 65.2(18.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 33.7(0.9)\n | 35.9(2.2)\n | 43.6(6.4)\n | 54.5(12.5)\n | 64.3(17.9)\n | 73.5(23.1)\n | 78.7(25.9)\n | 76.8(24.9)\n | 69.9(21.1)\n | 58.2(14.6)\n | 47.4(8.6)\n | 38.6(3.7)\n | 56.3(13.5)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 26.0(−3.3)\n | 27.5(−2.5)\n | 34.3(1.3)\n | 44.3(6.8)\n | 54.2(12.3)\n | 63.9(17.7)\n | 69.6(20.9)\n | 67.9(19.9)\n | 60.9(16.1)\n | 49.2(9.6)\n | 38.8(3.8)\n | 31.2(−0.4)\n | 47.3(8.5)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 10.7(−11.8)\n | 13.7(−10.2)\n | 20.8(−6.2)\n | 33.0(0.6)\n | 43.1(6.2)\n | 53.2(11.8)\n | 62.2(16.8)\n | 60.3(15.7)\n | 49.5(9.7)\n | 37.1(2.8)\n | 26.4(−3.1)\n | 19.0(−7.2)\n | 8.6(−13.0)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −7(−22)\n | −11(−24)\n | 5(−15)\n | 14(−10)\n | 28(−2)\n | 44(7)\n | 51(11)\n | 44(7)\n | 35(2)\n | 25(−4)\n | 8(−13)\n | −5(−21)\n | −11(−24)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 3.13(80)\n | 2.75(70)\n | 3.96(101)\n | 3.47(88)\n | 3.34(85)\n | 4.04(103)\n | 4.38(111)\n | 4.29(109)\n | 4.40(112)\n | 3.47(88)\n | 2.91(74)\n | 3.97(101)\n | 44.11(1,120)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 7.1(18)\n | 8.4(21)\n | 3.6(9.1)\n | 0.3(0.76)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.2(0.51)\n | 3.5(8.9)\n | 23.1(59)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 11.0\n | 9.7\n | 10.9\n | 10.9\n | 11.0\n | 10.3\n | 10.1\n | 8.9\n | 9.3\n | 9.1\n | 8.6\n | 11.0\n | 120.8\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 4.1\n | 3.8\n | 2.0\n | 0.2\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n | 1.8\n | 12.0\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 66.2\n | 63.6\n | 61.7\n | 60.4\n | 65.4\n | 67.8\n | 69.6\n | 70.4\n | 71.6\n | 70.8\n | 68.4\n | 67.7\n | 67.0\n |\n| Average dew point °F (°C)\n | 19.8(−6.8)\n | 21.0(−6.1)\n | 28.6(−1.9)\n | 37.0(2.8)\n | 49.5(9.7)\n | 59.2(15.1)\n | 64.6(18.1)\n | 63.7(17.6)\n | 57.2(14.0)\n | 45.7(7.6)\n | 35.6(2.0)\n | 25.5(−3.6)\n | 42.3(5.7)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 155.7\n | 154.7\n | 202.8\n | 217.0\n | 245.1\n | 271.2\n | 275.6\n | 260.1\n | 219.3\n | 204.5\n | 154.7\n | 137.7\n | 2,498.4\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 52\n | 52\n | 55\n | 55\n | 55\n | 61\n | 61\n | 61\n | 59\n | 59\n | 52\n | 47\n | 56\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 6\n | 8\n | 9\n | 9\n | 8\n | 6\n | 4\n | 2\n | 2\n | 5\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA (relative humidity, dew point and sun 1961–1990)[113][108][105] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV index)[114] |\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Philadelphia\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Average sea temperature °F (°C)\n | 41.8(5.5)\n | 39.9(4.4)\n | 41.2(5.1)\n | 46.7(8.2)\n | 53.9(12.2)\n | 66.3(19.0)\n | 74.0(23.3)\n | 75.9(24.4)\n | 71.4(21.9)\n | 64.2(17.9)\n | 55.1(12.8)\n | 47.7(8.8)\n | 56.5(13.6)\n |\n| Mean daily daylight hours\n | 10.0\n | 11.0\n | 12.0\n | 13.0\n | 14.0\n | 15.0\n | 15.0\n | 14.0\n | 12.0\n | 11.0\n | 10.0\n | 9.0\n | 12.2\n |\n| Source: Weather Atlas [114] |\n\n\n### Time Series[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Many smaller CSAs were also ranked higher for ozone including Sacramento (8th), Las Vegas (10th), Denver (11th), El Paso (16th), and Salt Lake City (20th); however, only two of those same ten CSAs—San Jose and Los Angeles—were ranked higher than Philadelphia for both year-round and short-term particle pollution.[117]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Chinese in Philadelphia; History of Irish Americans in Philadelphia; History of Italian Americans in Philadelphia; Koreans in Philadelphia; Little Saigon, Philadelphia; History of Jews in Philadelphia; LGBT culture in Philadelphia; and Puerto Ricans in Philadelphia\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1683 | 600 | —     |\n| 1731 | 12,000 | +1900.0% |\n| 1790 | 28,522 | +137.7% |\n| 1800 | 41,220 | +44.5% |\n| 1810 | 53,722 | +30.3% |\n| 1820 | 63,802 | +18.8% |\n| 1830 | 80,462 | +26.1% |\n| 1840 | 93,665 | +16.4% |\n| 1850 | 121,376 | +29.6% |\n| 1860 | 565,529 | +365.9% |\n| 1870 | 674,022 | +19.2% |\n| 1880 | 847,170 | +25.7% |\n| 1890 | 1,046,964 | +23.6% |\n| 1900 | 1,293,697 | +23.6% |\n| 1910 | 1,549,008 | +19.7% |\n| 1920 | 1,823,779 | +17.7% |\n| 1930 | 1,950,961 | +7.0% |\n| 1940 | 1,931,334 | −1.0% |\n| 1950 | 2,071,605 | +7.3% |\n| 1960 | 2,002,512 | −3.3% |\n| 1970 | 1,948,609 | −2.7% |\n| 1980 | 1,688,210 | −13.4% |\n| 1990 | 1,585,577 | −6.1% |\n| 2000 | 1,517,550 | −4.3% |\n| 2010 | 1,526,006 | +0.6% |\n| 2020 | 1,603,797 | +5.1% |\n| 2022 | 1,567,258 | −2.3% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[118]2010–2020[12]Source: U.S. Decennial Census[119] |\n\n\nAccording to the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau's tabulation, there were 1,603,797 people residing in Philadelphia, representing a 1.2% increase from the 2019 census estimate.[78] The racial composition of the city was 39.3% Black alone (42.0% Black alone or in combination), 36.3% White alone (41.9% White alone or in combination), 8.7% Asian alone, 0.4% American Indian and Alaska Native alone, 8.7% some other race, and 6.9% multiracial. 14.9% of residents were Hispanic or Latino. 34.8% had a bachelor's degree or higher. 23.9% spoke a language other than English at home, the most common of which was Spanish (10.8%). 15.0% of the populations foreign born, roughly half of whom are naturalized U.S. citizens. 3.7% of the population are veterans. The median household income was $52,889 and 22.8% of the population lived in poverty. 49.5% of the population drove alone to work, while 23.2% used public transit, 8.2% carpooled, 7.9% walked, and 7.0% worked from home. The average commute is 31 minutes.[120]\n\n\nAfter the 1950 census, when a record high of 2,071,605 was recorded, the city's population began a long decline. The population dropped to a low of 1,488,710 residents in 2006 before beginning to rise again. Between 2006 and 2017, Philadelphia added 92,153 residents. In 2017, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the racial composition of the city was 41.3% Black (non-Hispanic), 34.9% White (non-Hispanic), 14.1% Hispanic or Latino, 7.1% Asian, 0.4% Native American, 0.05% Pacific Islander, and 2.8% multiracial.[121]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Census racial composition | 2020[120] | 2010[122] | 2000 | 1990[123] | 1980[123] | 1970[123] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Black or African American (non-Hispanic) | 38.3% | 42.2% | 42.6% | 39.3% | 37.5% | 33.3%[e] |\n| White (non-Hispanic) | 34.3% | 36.9% | 42.5% | 52.1% | 57.1% | 63.8[e] |\n| Hispanic or Latino (of any race) | 14.9% | 12.3% | 8.5% | 5.6% | 3.8% | 2.4%[e] |\n| Asian | 8.3% | 6.3% | 4.5% | 2.7% | 1.1% | 0.3%\n |\n| Pacific Islanders | 0.1% | <0.1% | <0.1% | <0.1%\n |\n| Native Americans | 0.4% | 0.5% | 0.3% | 0.2% | 0.1% | 0.1%\n |\n| Two or more races | 6.9% | 2.8% | 2.2% | n/a[124] | n/a | n/a\n |\n\n\n![](image)Ethnic origins in Philadelphia\n### Immigration and cultural diversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's famed Italian Market in South Philadelphia\n![](image)A Gayborhood street sign near Washington Square\nIn addition to the city's economic growth, the city's population has been fueled by foreign immigration. According to The Pew Charitable Trusts, the city's foreign-born population increased by 69% between 2000 and 2016 to constitute nearly 20% of Philadelphia's workforce,[125] and it doubled between 1990 and 2017 to constitute 13.8% of the city's total population, with the top five countries of origin being China by a significant margin followed by the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, India, and Vietnam.[126]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 countries of origin for foreign-born Philadelphians, 2017[127]\n| Country | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) China | 22,140\n |\n| ![](image) Dominican Republic | 13,792\n |\n| ![](image) Jamaica | 13,500\n |\n| ![](image) India | 11,382\n |\n| ![](image) Vietnam | 10,132\n |\n| ![](image) Haiti | 9,186\n |\n| ![](image) Mexico | 7,823\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | 6,898\n |\n| ![](image) Albania | 5,258\n |\n| ![](image) South Korea/![](image) North Korea | 4,385\n |\n\n\nIrish, Italian, German, Polish, English, Russian, Ukrainian, and French ancestries constitute the largest European ethnic groups in the city.[128] Philadelphia has the second-largest Irish and Italian populations in the United States after New York City. South Philadelphia remains one of the largest Italian neighborhoods in the country and is home to the Italian Market.\n\n\nThe Pennsport neighborhood and Gray's Ferry section of South Philadelphia, home to many Mummer clubs, are well known as Irish neighborhoods. The Kensington, Port Richmond, and Fishtown neighborhoods have historically been heavily Irish and Polish. Port Richmond is a center for the Polish-American community in Philadelphia, and it remains a common destination for Polish immigrants. Northeast Philadelphia, although known for its Irish and Irish-American population, is home to a Jewish and Russian population. Mount Airy in Northwest Philadelphia also contains a Jewish community. Nearby Chestnut Hill is historically known as an Anglo-Saxon Protestant community.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Black American population is the fourth-largest in the country after New York City, Chicago, and Houston. West Philadelphia and North Philadelphia are largely African-American neighborhoods, but many are leaving those areas in favor of the Northeast and Southwest sections of Philadelphia. A higher proportion of African-American Muslims reside in Philadelphia than most other major U.S. cities. West Philadelphia and Southwest Philadelphia are home to various Afro-Caribbean and African immigrant communities.[129]\n\n\nThe Puerto Rican population in Philadelphia is the second-largest on the U.S. mainland after New York City, and the second-fastest growing after Orlando.[130] Eastern North Philadelphia, particularly Fairhill and surrounding areas to the north and east, has one of the highest concentrations of Puerto Ricans outside Puerto Rico, with many large swaths of blocks being close to 100% Puerto Rican.[131][132] Puerto Rican and Dominican populations reside in North Philadelphia and the Northeast, and Mexican and Central American populations exist in South Philadelphia.[133] South American migrants were being transported by bus from Texas to Philadelphia beginning in 2022.[134]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Asian American population includes those of Chinese, Indians, Vietnamese, South Koreans, and Filipinos. Over 35,000 Chinese Americans lived in the city in 2015,[135] including a Fuzhounese population. Center City hosts a Chinatown that is served by Chinatown bus lines with service to/from Chinatown, Manhattan.[136] A Korean community initially settled in the North Philadelphia neighborhood of Olney; however, the primary Koreatown has subsequently shifted further north, straddling the city's border with adjacent Cheltenham in Montgomery County and Cherry Hill in South Jersey. South Philadelphia is home to Vietnamese-Americans in Little Saigon, as well as Cambodian Americans, Thai Americans, and Chinese communities.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Gay village near Washington Square is home to a concentration of gay and lesbian-friendly businesses, restaurants, and bars.[137][138]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Philadelphia\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 68% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christian.[139] Approximately 41% of Christians in the city and area professed attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, while 26% professed Catholic beliefs.\n\n\nThe Protestant Christian community in Philadelphia is dominated by mainline Protestant denominations including the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church in the United States, Presbyterian Church (USA) and American Baptist Churches USA. One of the most prominent mainline Protestant jurisdictions is the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. The African Methodist Episcopal Church was established in Philadelphia. Historically, the city has strong connections to the Quakers, Unitarian Universalism, and the Ethical Culture movement, all of which continue to be represented in the city. The Quaker Friends General Conference is based in Philadelphia. Evangelical Protestants making up less than 15% of the population were also prevalent. Evangelical Protestant bodies included the Anglican Church in North America, Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod, Presbyterian Church in America, and National Baptist Convention of America.\nThe Catholic community is primarily served by the Latin Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia, and the Syro-Malankara Catholic Eparchy of the United States of America and Canada, though some independent Catholic churches exist throughout Philadelphia and its suburbs. The Latin Church-based jurisdiction is headquartered in the city, and its see is the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul. The Ukrainian Catholic jurisdiction is also headquartered in Philadelphia, and is seated at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.\n\n\nLess than 1% of Philadelphia's Christians were Mormons. The remainder of the Christian demographic is spread among smaller Protestant denominations and the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox among others. The Diocese of Eastern Pennsylvania (Orthodox Church in America) and Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America (Ecumenical Patriarchate) divide the Eastern Orthodox in Philadelphia. The Russian Orthodox St. Andrew's Cathedral is in the city.\nThe same study says that other religions collectively compose about 8% of the population, including Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, and Sikhism.[140] Philadelphia has the fifth-largest Muslim population among U.S. cities.[141] The remaining 24% claimed no religious affiliation.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia metropolitan area's Jewish population was estimated at 206,000 in 2001, which was the sixth-largest in the U.S. at that time.[142] Jewish traders were operating in southeastern Pennsylvania long before William Penn. Furthermore, Jews in Philadelphia took a prominent part in the War of Independence. Although the majority of the early Jewish residents were of Portuguese or Spanish descent, some among them had emigrated from Germany and Poland. About the beginning of the 19th century, a number of Jews from the latter countries, finding the services of the Congregation Mickvé Israel unfamiliar to them, resolved to form a new congregation which would use the ritual to which they had been accustomed.\n\n\nAfrican diasporic religions are practiced in some Latino and Hispanic and Caribbean communities in North and West Philadelphia.[143][144]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2010[update], 79.12% (1,112,441) of Philadelphia residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 9.72% (136,688) spoke Spanish, 1.64% (23,075) Chinese, 0.89% (12,499) Vietnamese, 0.77% (10,885) Russian, 0.66% (9,240) French, 0.61% (8,639) other Asian languages, 0.58% (8,217) African languages, 0.56% (7,933) Cambodian (Mon-Khmer), and Italian was spoken as a main language by 0.55% (7,773) of the population over the age of five.

The culture of American popular music has been influenced by significant contributions of Philadelphia area musicians and producers, in both the recording and broadcasting industries. In 1952, the teen dance party program called *Bandstand* premiered on local television, hosted by Bob Horn. The show was renamed *American Bandstand* in 1957, when it began national syndication on ABC, hosted by Dick Clark and produced in Philadelphia until 1964 when it moved to Los Angeles.[196] Promoters marketed youthful musical artists known as teen idols to appeal to the young audience. Philadelphia-born singers such as Frankie Avalon, James Darren, Eddie Fisher, Fabian Forte, and Bobby Rydell, along with South Philly-raised Chubby Checker, topped the music charts, establishing a clean-cut rock and roll image.\n\n\nPhilly soul music of the late 1960s–1970s is a highly produced version of soul music which led to later forms of popular music such as disco and urban contemporary rhythm and blues.[197] On July 13, 1985, John F. Kennedy Stadium was the American venue for the Live Aid concert.[198] The city also hosted the Live 8 concert, which attracted about 700,000 people to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway on July 2, 2005.[199]\n\n\nNotable rock and pop musicians from Philadelphia and its suburbs include Bill Haley & His Comets, Nazz, Todd Rundgren, Hall & Oates, the Hooters, Cinderella, DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, Ween, Schoolly D, Pink, the Roots, Beanie Sigel, State Property, Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes, Meek Mill, Lil Uzi Vert, and others.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuisine of Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Pat's Steaks (foreground) and Geno's Steaks (background) in South Philadelphia\nThe city is known for its hoagies, stromboli, roast pork sandwich, scrapple, soft pretzels, water ice, Irish potato candy, tastykakes, and the cheesesteak sandwich which was developed by Italian immigrants.[200] The Philadelphia area has many establishments that serve cheesesteaks, including restaurants, taverns, delicatessens and pizza parlors.[201][202][203] The originator of the thinly-sliced steak sandwich in the 1930s, initially without cheese, is Pat's King of Steaks, which faces its rival Geno's Steaks, founded in 1966,[204] across the intersection of 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue in the Italian Market of South Philadelphia.[205]\n\n\nMcGillin's Olde Ale House, opened in 1860 on Drury Street in Center City, is the oldest continuously operated tavern in the city.[206] The City Tavern is a replica of a historic 18th-century building first opened in 1773, demolished in 1854 after a fire, and rebuilt in 1975 on the same site as part of Independence National Historical Park.[207] The tavern offers authentic 18th-century recipes, served in seven period dining rooms, three wine cellar rooms and an outdoor garden.[208]\n\n\nThe Reading Terminal Market is a historic food market founded in 1893 in the Reading Terminal building, a designated National Historic Landmark.

Additionally, it shares many similarities with the New York accent. Owing to over a century of linguistic data collected by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania under sociolinguist William Labov, the Philadelphia dialect has been one of the best-studied forms of American English.[211][212][f] The accent is especially found within the Irish American and Italian American working-class neighborhoods.[213] Philadelphia also has its own unique collection of neologisms and slang terms.[214]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Philadelphia 76ers, Philadelphia Flyers, Philadelphia Eagles, Philadelphia Phillies, and Philadelphia Union\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nCitizens Bank Park, home of the Phillies since 2004, and Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Eagles since 2003\n\n![](image)The Philadelphia Eagles are presented with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018\n![](image)Wells Fargo Center in South Philadelphia, home of the two-time Stanley Cup champion Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL) and three-time champion Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA)\n![](image)Historic Boathouse Row at night on the Schuylkill River, a symbol of the city's rich rowing history\nPhiladelphia's first professional sports team was baseball's Athletics, organized in 1860.[215] The Athletics were initially an amateur league team that turned professional in 1871, and then became a founding team of the current National League in 1876.[216] The city is one of 13 U.S. cities to have teams in all four major league sports: the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB), the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL), the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL), and the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).[217] The Phillies, formed in 1883 as the Quakers and renamed in 1884,[218] are the oldest team continuously playing under the same name in the same city in the history of American professional sports.[219]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia metro area is also home to the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer (MLS). The Union began playing their home games in 2010 at PPL Park, a soccer-specific stadium in Chester, Pennsylvania.[220] The stadium's name was changed to Talen Energy Stadium in 2016[221] and to Subaru Park in 2020.[222]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was the second of eight American cities to have won titles in all four major leagues (MLB, NFL, NHL and NBA), and also has a title in soccer from the now-defunct North American Soccer League in the 1970s. The city's professional teams and their fans endured 25 years without a championship, from the 76ers 1983 NBA Finals win[223] until the Phillies 2008 World Series win.[224][225] The lack of championships was sometimes attributed in jest to the Curse of Billy Penn after One Liberty Place became the first building to surpass the height of the William Penn statue on top of City Hall's tower in 1987.[226] After nine years passed without another championship, the Eagles won their first Super Bowl following the 2017 season.[227] In 2004, ESPN placed Philadelphia second on its list of The Fifteen Most Tortured Sports Cities.[228][229] Fans of the Eagles and Phillies were singled out as the worst fans in the country by *GQ* magazine in 2011, which used the subtitle of \"Meanest Fans in America\" to summarize incidents of drunken behavior and a history of booing.[230][231]\n\n\nMajor professional sports teams that originated in Philadelphia but later moved to other cities include the Golden State Warriors basketball team, which played in Philadelphia from 1946 to 1962[232] and the Oakland Athletics baseball team, which was originally the Philadelphia Athletics and played in Philadelphia from 1901 to 1954.[233]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is home to professional, semi-professional, and elite amateur teams in cricket, rugby league (Philadelphia Fight), and rugby union.

The Spinners were one of the original eight teams of the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) that began in 2012. They played at Franklin Field and won the inaugural AUDL championship and the final MLU championship in 2016.[242] The MLU was suspended indefinitely by its investors in December 2016.[243] As of 2018[update], the Philadelphia Phoenix continue to play in the AUDL.[244]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is home to the Philadelphia Big 5, a group of five NCAA Division I college basketball programs. The Big 5 include La Salle, Penn, Saint Joseph's, Temple, and Villanova universities.[245] The sixth NCAA Division I school in Philadelphia is Drexel University. Villanova won the 1985,[246] 2016,[247] and 2018[248] championship of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Philadelphia will be one of the eleven US host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[249]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | League\n | Sport\n | Venue\n | Capacity\n | Founded\n | Championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Philadelphia Phillies | MLB | Baseball\n | Citizens Bank Park | 46,528\n | 1883\n | 1980, 2008\n |\n| Philadelphia Eagles | NFL | American football\n | Lincoln Financial Field | 69,176\n | 1933\n | 1948, 1949, 1960, 2017\n |\n| Philadelphia 76ers | NBA | Basketball\n | Wells Fargo Center | 21,600\n | 1963\n | 1966–67, 1982–83 |\n| Philadelphia Flyers | NHL | Ice hockey\n | Wells Fargo Center | 19,786\n | 1967\n | 1973–74, 1974–75 |\n| Philadelphia Union | MLS | Soccer\n | Subaru Park | 18,500\n | 2010\n | none\n |\n| Philadelphia Wings | NLL | Lacrosse\n | Wells Fargo Center | 19,786\n | 2018\n | none\n |\n\n\n## Law and government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Philadelphia City Hall\n\n![](image)Old City Hall at 5th and Chestnut Street served as Philadelphia's town hall from 1800 to 1854.\n![](image)The James A.

All county functions were assumed by the city in 1952.[252] The city has been coterminous with the county since 1854.[63]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's 1952 Home Rule Charter was written by the City Charter Commission, which was created by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in an act of April 21, 1949, and a city ordinance of June 15, 1949. The existing city council received a proposed draft on February 14, 1951, and the electors approved it in an election held April 17, 1951.[253] The first elections under the new Home Rule Charter were held in November 1951, and the newly elected officials took office in January 1952.[252]\n\n\nThe city uses the strong-mayor version of the mayor–council form of government, which is led by one mayor in whom executive authority is vested. The mayor has the authority to appoint and dismiss members of all boards and commissions without the approval of the city council. Elected at-large, the mayor is limited to two consecutive four-year terms, but can run for the position again after an intervening term.[253]\n\n\n\n### Courts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: District Attorney of Philadelphia, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia County is coterminous with the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania. The Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas is the trial court of general jurisdiction for the city, hearing felony-level criminal cases and civil suits above the minimum jurisdictional limit of $10,000. The court also has appellate jurisdiction over rulings from the Municipal and Traffic Courts, and some administrative agencies and boards. The trial division has 70 commissioned judges elected by the voters, along with about one thousand other employees.[254] The court also has a family division with 25 judges[255] and an orphans' court with three judges.[256]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the city's District Attorney is Larry Krasner, a Democrat.[257] The last Republican to hold the office is Ronald D. Castille, who left in 1991 and later served as the Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court from 2008 to 2014.[258]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Municipal Court handles traffic cases, misdemeanor and felony criminal cases with maximum incarceration of five years, and civil cases involving $12,000 or less ($15,000 in real estate and school tax cases), and all landlord-tenant disputes. The municipal court has 27 judges elected by the voters.[259]\n\n\nPennsylvania's three appellate courts also have sittings in Philadelphia. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the court of last resort in the state, regularly hears arguments in Philadelphia City Hall.[260] The Superior Court of Pennsylvania and the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania also sit in Philadelphia several times a year.[261][262] Judges for these courts are elected at large.[263] The state Supreme Court and Superior Court have deputy prothonotary offices in Philadelphia.[264][265]\n\n\nAdditionally, Philadelphia is home to the federal United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, both of which are housed in the James A. Byrne United States Courthouse.[266][267]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mayors of Philadelphia; Philadelphia City Council; and Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania § Politics\n\n![](image)Jim Kenney (D), the 99th and current Mayor of Philadelphia\nThe current mayor is Jim Kenney who won the election in November 2015.[268] Kenney's predecessor was Michael Nutter who had served two terms from 2009 to January 2016.[269] Kenney is a member of the Democratic Party as all Philadelphia mayors have been since 1952. Philadelphia City Council is the legislative branch which consists of ten council members representing individual districts and seven members elected at-large, all of whom are elected to four-year terms.[270] Democrats are currently the majority and hold 14 seats including nine of the ten districts and five at-large seats. Republicans hold two seats: one at-large seat and the Northeast-based Tenth District. The Working Families Party holds one at-large seat. The current council president is Darrell L. Clarke.[271]\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were 1,102,620 registered voters in Philadelphia.[272] Registered voters constitute 70.3% of the total population.[g]\n\n\n\n* Democratic: 853,140 (77.4%)\n* Republican: 125,530 (11.4%)\n* Other parties and unaffiliated: 123,950 (11.2%)[272]\n\n\n\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania[273]\n| Year\n | Republican | Democratic | Third party |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| No.  | % | No.  | % | No.  | %\n |\n| **2020** | 132,870\n | 17.86%\n | 604,175\n | **81.21%** | 6,921\n | 0.93%\n |\n| **2016** | 108,748\n | 15.32%\n | 584,025\n | **82.30%** | 16,845\n | 2.37%\n |\n| **2012** | 96,467\n | 13.97%\n | 588,806\n | **85.24%** | 5,503\n | 0.80%\n |\n| **2008** | 117,221\n | 16.33%\n | 595,980\n | **83.00%** | 4,824\n | 0.67%\n |\n| **2004** | 130,099\n | 19.30%\n | 542,205\n | **80.44%** | 1,765\n | 0.26%\n |\n| **2000** | 100,959\n | 17.99%\n | 449,182\n | **80.04%** | 11,039\n | 1.97%\n |\n| **1996** | 85,345\n | 16.00%\n | 412,988\n | **77.44%** | 34,944\n | 6.55%\n |\n| **1992** | 133,328\n | 20.90%\n | 434,904\n | **68.16%** | 69,826\n | 10.94%\n |\n| **1988** | 219,053\n | 32.45%\n | 449,566\n | **66.60%** | 6,358\n | 0.94%\n |\n| **1984** | 267,178\n | 34.60%\n | 501,369\n | **64.94%** | 3,555\n | 0.46%\n |\n| **1980** | 244,108\n | 33.99%\n | 421,253\n | **58.66%** | 52,739\n | 7.34%\n |\n| **1976** | 239,000\n | 32.03%\n | 494,579\n | **66.28%** | 12,618\n | 1.69%\n |\n| **1972** | 344,096\n | 43.89%\n | 431,736\n | **55.07%** | 8,138\n | 1.04%\n |\n| **1968** | 254,153\n | 29.90%\n | 525,768\n | **61.85%** | 70,196\n | 8.26%\n |\n| **1964** | 239,733\n | 26.24%\n | 670,645\n | **73.42%** | 3,094\n | 0.34%\n |\n| **1960** | 291,000\n | 31.79%\n | 622,544\n | **68.02%** | 1,733\n | 0.19%\n |\n| **1956** | 383,414\n | 42.97%\n | 507,289\n | **56.85%** | 1,618\n | 0.18%\n |\n| **1952** | 396,874\n | 41.40%\n | 557,352\n | **58.15%** | 4,321\n | 0.45%\n |\n| **1948** | 425,962\n | 48.12%\n | 432,699\n | **48.88%** | 26,636\n | 3.01%\n |\n| **1944** | 346,380\n | 40.96%\n | 496,367\n | **58.70%** | 2,883\n | 0.34%\n |\n| **1940** | 354,878\n | 39.81%\n | 532,149\n | **59.69%** | 4,459\n | 0.50%\n |\n| **1936** | 329,881\n | 36.94%\n | 539,757\n | **60.45%** | 23,310\n | 2.61%\n |\n| **1932** | 331,092\n | **54.54%** | 260,276\n | 42.88%\n | 15,651\n | 2.58%\n |\n| **1928** | 420,320\n | **59.99%** | 276,573\n | 39.48%\n | 3,703\n | 0.53%\n |\n| **1924** | 347,457\n | **77.73%** | 54,213\n | 12.13%\n | 45,352\n | 10.15%\n |\n| **1920** | 307,826\n | **73.43%** | 90,151\n | 21.50%\n | 21,235\n | 5.07%\n |\n| **1916** | 194,163\n | **66.81%** | 90,800\n | 31.25%\n | 5,638\n | 1.94%\n |\n| **1912** | 91,944\n | **36.53%** | 66,308\n | 26.35%\n | 93,438\n | 37.12%\n |\n| **1908** | 185,263\n | **69.09%** | 75,310\n | 28.09%\n | 7,568\n | 2.82%\n |\n| **1904** | 227,709\n | **80.85%** | 48,784\n | 17.32%\n | 5,161\n | 1.83%\n |\n| **1900** | 173,657\n | **73.93%** | 58,179\n | 24.77%\n | 3,053\n | 1.30%\n |\n| **1896** | 176,462\n | **72.06%** | 63,323\n | 25.86%\n | 5,102\n | 2.08%\n |\n| **1892** | 116,685\n | **57.45%** | 84,470\n | 41.59%\n | 1,947\n | 0.96%\n |\n| **1888** | 111,358\n | **54.20%** | 92,786\n | 45.16%\n | 1,300\n | 0.63%\n |\n| **1884** | 101,288\n | **58.00%** | 71,288\n | 40.82%\n | 2,057\n | 1.18%\n |\n| **1880** | 97,220\n | **55.92%** | 76,330\n | 43.91%\n | 294\n | 0.17%\n |\n\n\nPhiladelphia had historically been a bastion of the Republican Party from the American Civil War until the mid-1930s.[274][275] The city hosted the first Republican National Convention in 1856.[276] Democratic registrations increased after the Great Depression; however, the city was not carried by Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt in his landslide victory of 1932 as Pennsylvania was one of only six states won by Republican Herbert Hoover. Voter turnout surged from 600,000 in 1932 to nearly 900,000 in 1936 and Roosevelt carried Philadelphia with over 60% of the vote. The city has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1936. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama drew 83% of the city's vote. Obama's win was even greater in 2012, capturing 85% of the vote. In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton won 82% of the vote.[273]\n\n\nAs a result of the previously declining population in the city and state,[277] Philadelphia has only three congressional districts of the 18 districts in Pennsylvania, based on the 2010 census apportionment:[278] the 2nd district, represented by Brendan Boyle; the 3rd, represented by Dwight Evans; and the 5th, represented by Mary Gay Scanlon.[279] All three representatives are Democrats though Republicans still have some support in the city, primarily in the Northeast.[280] Sam Katz ran competitive mayoral races as the Republican nominee in 1999 and 2003, losing to Democrat John Street both times.[281][282]\n\n\nPennsylvania's longest-serving Senator, Arlen Specter,[283] was an alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania who opened his first law practice in Philadelphia.[284] Specter served as a Republican from 1981 and as a Democrat from 2009, losing that party's primary in 2010 and leaving office in January 2011.[285] He had also been assistant counsel on the Warren Commission in 1964 and the city's district attorney from 1966 to 1974.[284]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has hosted various national conventions, including in 1848 (Whig), 1856 (Republican), 1872 (Republican), 1900 (Republican), 1936 (Democratic), 1940 (Republican), 1948 (Republican), 1948 (Progressive), 2000 (Republican), and 2016 (Democratic).[286] Philadelphia has been home to one vice president, George M. Dallas,[287] and one general of the American Civil War, George B. McClellan, who won his party's nomination for president but lost in the general election to Abraham Lincoln in 1864.[288] In May 2019, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden chose Philadelphia to be his 2020 U.S. presidential campaign headquarters.[289]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\n\"Green Cities, Clean Water\" is an environmental policy initiative based in Philadelphia that has shown promising results in mitigating the effects of climate change.[290] The researchers on the policy have stated that despite such promising plans of green infrastructure building, \"the city is forecasted to grow warmer, wetter, and more urbanized over the century, runoff and local temperatures will increase on average throughout the city\".[290] Even though landcover predictive models on the effects of the policy initiative have indicated that green infrastructure could be useful at decreasing the amount of runoff in the city over time, the city government would have to expand its current plans and \"consider the cobenefit of climate change adaptation when planning new projects'' in limiting the scope of city-wide temperature increase.[290]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Crime in Philadelphia and Philadelphia crime family\n\n#### Police and law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Police Department\n\n![](image)The Philadelphia Police Department administration building, known as the Roundhouse, in Center City east of Chinatown\n![](image)A Philadelphia police cruiser on Benjamin Franklin Parkway\nAccording to a 2015 report by Pew Charitable Trusts, the police districts with the highest rates of violent crime were Frankford (15th district) and Kensington (24th district) in the Near Northeast, and districts to the North (22nd, 25th, and 35th districts), West (19th district) and Southwest (12th district) of Center City. Each of those seven districts recorded more than a thousand violent crimes in 2014. The lowest rates of violent crime occurred in Center City, South Philadelphia, the Far Northeast, and Roxborough districts, the latter of which includes Manayunk.[150]\n\n\nPhiladelphia had 500 (503 according to some sources) murders in 1990, a rate of 31.5 per 100,000. An average of about 400 murders occurred each year for most of the 1990s. The murder count dropped in 2002 to 288, then rose to 406 by 2006, before dropping slightly to 392 in 2007.[291][292] A few years later, Philadelphia began to see a rapid decline in homicides and violent crime. In 2013, the city had 246 murders, which is a decrease of nearly 40% since 2006.[293] In 2014, 248 homicides were committed. The homicide rate rose to 280 in 2015, then fell slightly to 277 in 2016, before rising again to 317 in 2017.[294] Homicides increased dramatically in the late 2010s/early 2020s, reaching 499 homicides in 2020[291] and surpassing the 1990 \"record\" in 2021, with 501st murder on November 27 and 510 by the end of the month.[295]\n\n\nIn 2006, Philadelphia's homicide rate of 27.7 per 100,000 people was the highest of the country's 10 most populous cities.[296] In 2012, Philadelphia had the fourth-highest homicide rate among the country's most populous cities. The rate dropped to 16 homicides per 100,000 residents by 2014 placing Philadelphia as the sixth-highest city in the country.[150]\n\n\nThe number of shootings in the city has declined significantly since the early years of the 21st century. Shooting incidents peaked at 1,857 in 2006 before declining nearly 44 percent to 1,047 shootings in 2014.[150] Major crimes have decreased gradually since a peak in 2006 when 85,498 major crimes were reported. The number of reported major crimes fell 11 percent in three years to 68,815 occurrences in 2014. Violent crimes, which include homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery, decreased 14 percent in three years to 15,771 occurrences in 2014.[150]\n\n\nIn 2014, Philadelphia enacted an ordinance decriminalizing the possession of less than 30 grams of marijuana or 8 grams of hashish; the ordinance gave police officers the discretion to treat possession of these amounts as a civil infraction punishable by a $25 ticket, rather than a crime.[297][298] Philadelphia was at the time the largest city to decriminalize the possession of marijuana.[298] From 2013 to 2018, marijuana arrests in the city dropped by more than 85%.[297] The purchase or sale of marijuana remains a criminal offense in Philadelphia.[298]\n\n\n\n#### Firefighting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Fire Department\n\nThe Philadelphia Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency medical services (EMS). The department's official mission is to protect public safety by quick and professional response to emergencies and the promotion of sound emergency prevention measures. This mandate encompasses all traditional firefighting functions, including fire suppression, with 60 engine companies and 30 ladder companies[299] as well as specialty and support units deployed throughout the city; specialized firefighting units for Philadelphia International Airport and the Port of Philadelphia; investigations conducted by the fire marshal's office to determine the origins of fires and develop preventive strategies; prevention programs to educate the public; and support services including research and planning, management of the fire communications center within the city's 911 system, and operation of the Philadelphia Fire Academy.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Media in Philadelphia\n\n### Newspapers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Inquirer Building at 400 North Broad Street was home of *The Philadelphia Inquirer*, the nation's third-longest continuously published newspaper, until 2012 when it moved its headquarters to Market Street. The building is currently undergoing renovations to become the new headquarters of the Philadelphia Police Department.\nPhiladelphia's two major daily newspapers are *The Philadelphia Inquirer*, first published in 1829—the third-oldest surviving daily newspaper in the country—and the *Philadelphia Daily News*, first published in 1925.[300] The *Daily News* has been published as an edition of the *Inquirer* since 2009.[301] Recent owners of the *Inquirer* and *Daily News* have included Knight Ridder, The McClatchy Company, and Philadelphia Media Holdings, with the latter organization declaring bankruptcy in 2010.[302] After two years of financial struggle, the newspapers were sold to Interstate General Media in 2012.[302] The two newspapers had a combined daily circulation of 306,831 and a Sunday circulation of 477,313 in 2013[update], the 18th-largest circulation in the country, and the website of the newspapers, Philly.com,[303] was ranked 13th in popularity among online U.S. newspapers by Alexa Internet that same year.[304]\n\n\nSmaller publications include the *Philadelphia Tribune* published five days each week for the African-American community;[305] *Philadelphia* magazine, a monthly regional magazine;[306] *Philadelphia Weekly*, a weekly alternative newspaper;[307] *Philadelphia Gay News*, a weekly newspaper for the LGBT community;[308] *The Jewish Exponent*, a weekly newspaper for the Jewish community;[309] *Al Día*, a weekly newspaper for the Latino community;[310] and *Philadelphia Metro*, a free daily newspaper.[311]\n\n\nStudent-run newspapers include the University of Pennsylvania's *The Daily Pennsylvanian*,[312] Temple University's *The Temple News*,[313] and Drexel University's *The Triangle*.[314]\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nThe first experimental radio license was issued in Philadelphia in August 1912 to St. Joseph's College. The first commercial AM radio stations began broadcasting in 1922: first WIP, then owned by Gimbels department store, followed by WFIL, then owned by Strawbridge & Clothier department store, and WOO, a defunct station owned by Wanamaker's department store, as well as WCAU and WDAS.[315]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the FCC lists 28 FM and 11 AM stations for Philadelphia.[316][317] As of December 2017, the ten highest-rated stations in Philadelphia were adult contemporary WBEB-FM (101.1), sports talk WIP-FM (94.1), classic rock WMGK-FM (102.9), urban adult contemporary WDAS-FM (105.3), classic hits WOGL-FM (98.1), album-oriented rock WMMR-FM (93.3), country music WXTU-FM (92.5), all-news KYW-AM (1060), talk radio WHYY-FM (90.9), and urban adult contemporary WRNB-FM (100.3).[318][319] Philadelphia is served by three non-commercial public radio stations: WHYY-FM (NPR),[320] WRTI-FM (classical and jazz),[321] and WXPN-FM (adult alternative music).[322]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRadio stations in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, metropolitan area\n |\n| --- |\n| By AM frequency | * 560\n* 610\n* 640\n* 690\n* 740\n* 800\n* 860\n* 900\n* 950\n* 990\n* 10601\n* 1180\n* 12101\n* 1310\n* 1340\n* 1370\n* 1420\n* 1440\n* 1460\n* 1480\n* 1490\n* 1520\n* 1540\n* 1570\n* 1590\n* 1640\n* 1680\n |\n| By FM frequency | * 88.1\n\t+ WPEB\n\t+ WTHA\n\t+ WZZD\n* 88.3\n* 88.5\n* 88.7\n* 88.9\n\t+ WBYO\n\t+ WBZC\n* 89.1\n* 89.3\n\t+ WRDV\n\t+ WRTJ\n* 89.5\n* 89.7\n* 90.1\n* 90.9\n* 91.5\n\t+ WDBK\n\t+ WSRN-FM\n* 91.7\n\t+ WBMR\n\t+ WCUR\n\t+ WKDU\n\t+ WLBS\n* 92.5\n* 93.3\n* 93.7\n* 94.1\n* 94.5\n* 94.9\n* 95.7\n* 96.5\n* 97.5\n* 98.1\n* 98.9\n* 99.5\n* 99.9\n* 100.3\n* 101.1\n* 101.5\n* 102.1\n* 102.9\n* 103.9\n* 104.5\n* 105.3\n* 106.1\n* 106.9\n* 107.9\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| LPFM | * 92.9\n\t+ WGGT-LP\n\t+ WOOM-LP\n\t+ WRGU-LP\n\t+ WRLG-LP\n\t+ WZML-LP\n* 98.5\n\t+ WJYN-LP\n\t+ WNUW-LP\n\t+ WQEW-LP\n* 106.5\n |\n| Translators | * 92.9\n* 94.9\n* 95.1\n* 95.3\n* 96.1\n* 97.1\n\t+ W246AR\n\t+ W246AQ\n* 98.5\n* 99.9\n* 100.7\n* 102.5\n* 103.3\n* 103.5\n* 103.9\n* 104.1\n* 105.7\n\t+ W289AZ\n\t+ W289CZ\n* 107.3\n |\n\n |\n| NOAA Weather Radiofrequency | * 162.425\n* 162.475\n |\n| Digital radioby frequency & subchannel | * 1210\n* 88.5-1\n* 88.5-2\n* 89.3-1\n* 89.3-2\n* 89.5-1\n* 89.5-2\n* 90.1-1\n* 90.1-2\n* 90.9-1\n* 92.5-1\n* 92.5-2\n* 93.3-1\n* 93.3-2\n* 93.7-1\n* 93.7-2\n* 93.7-3\n* 94.1-1\n* 94.1-2\n* 94.1-3\n* 95.7-1\n* 95.7-2\n* 96.5-1\n* 96.5-2\n* 97.5-1\n* 97.5-2\n* 97.5-3\n* 98.1-1\n* 98.1-2\n* 98.1-3\n* 98.9-1\n* 99.5-1\n* 100.3-1\n* 100.3-2\n* 100.3-3\n* 101.1-1\n* 101.1-2\n* 101.5-1\n* 101.5-2\n* 102.1-1\n* 102.1-2\n* 102.1-3\n* 102.9-1\n* 102.9-2\n* 102.9-3\n* 104.5-1\n* 104.5-2\n* 105.3-1\n* 105.3-2\n* 106.1-1\n* 106.1-2\n* 106.9-1\n* 106.9-2\n* 106.9-3\n* 107.9-1\n* 107.9-2\n |\n| By call sign | * KIH28\n* KYW1\n* W225DJ\n* W235CE\n* W236CL\n* W237EH\n* W241CH\n* W246AR\n* W246AQ\n* W253CA\n* W260CZ\n* W264BH\n* W273DO\n* W277DL\n* W278AK\n* W280CP\n* W281CL\n* W289AZ\n* W289CZ\n* W297AD\n* WBCB\n* WBEB\n\t+ HD2\n* WBEN-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WBMR\n* WBYO\n* WBZC\n* WCHE\n* WCHR\n* WCOJ\n* WCUR\n* WDAS\n* WDAS-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WDBK\n* WEMG\n* WFIL\n* WFYL\n* WGGT-LP\n* WGLS-FM\n* WHAT\n* WHHS\n* WHYY\n* WIFI\n* WIOQ\n* WIP-FM\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WISP\n* WJFP\n* WJYN-LP\n* WKDN\n* WKDU\n* WKVP\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WKXW\n\t+ HD2\n* WLBS\n* WMGK\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WMMR\n\t+ HD2\n* WNG704\n* WNPV\n* WNTP\n* WNUW-LP\n* WNWR\n* WOGL\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WOOM-LP\n* WPAZ\n* WPEB\n* WPEN\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WPHE\n* WPHI-FM\n* WPHT1\n* WPNX700\n* WPPM-LP\n* WPPZ-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WPST\n* WPWA\n* WQEW-LP\n* WQHS\n* WRDV\n* WRFF\n\t+ HD2\n* WRGU-LP\n* WRLG-LP\n* WRNB\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WRSD\n* WRTI\n\t+ HD2\n* WRTJ\n\t+ HD2\n* WSRN-FM\n* WSTW\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WTDY-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WTEL\n* WTHA\n* WTMR\n* WTTM\n* WUMR\n\t+ HD2\n* WURD\n* WUSL\n* WVCW\n* WWDB\n* WWJZ\n* WWLU\n* WXPN\n\t+ HD2\n* WXTU\n\t+ HD2\n* WXVU\n* WYPA\n\t+ HD2\n* WZML-LP\n* WZXE\n* WZZD\n |\n| Internet | * WEXP\n* WQHS\n* WYBF\n |\n| Defunct | * WDNR (89.5 FM)\n* WEXP (1600 AM)\n* WJJZ (1460 AM)\n* WNAP (1110 AM)\n* WNJC (1360 AM)\n* WOO\n* WQHS\n* WYBF (89.1 FM)\n* WZZE (97.3 FM)\n |\n| Radio stations in the Delaware Valley\nPhiladelphia\nVineland-Millville-Bridgeton\nWilmington\n\nOther nearby regions\nAllentown-Bethlehem\nAtlantic City-Cape May\nDover\nLancaster\nReading\nTrenton\nSee also\nList of radio stations in Pennsylvania\n* Mass media in the Philadelphia Area\n\t+ Radio stations\n\t+ TV stations\n\t+ Newspapers\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nNotes\n1.

The station became NBC's first affiliate in 1939, and later became KYW-TV (currently a CBS affiliate). WCAU-TV, WFIL-TV, and WHYY-TV were all founded by the 1960s.[315] In 1952, WFIL (renamed WPVI) premiered the television show *Bandstand*, which later became the nationally broadcast *American Bandstand* hosted by Dick Clark.[323]\n\n\nEach commercial network has an affiliate in Philadelphia: KYW-TV 3 (CBS), WPVI-TV 6 (ABC), WCAU 10 (NBC), WPHL-TV 17 (The CW with MyNetworkTV on DT2), WFPA-CD 28 (UniMás), WTXF-TV 29 (Fox), WPSG 57 (Independent), WWSI 62 (Telemundo), and WUVP-DT 65 (Univision). The region is served also by public broadcasting stations WPPT-TV (Philadelphia), WHYY-TV (Wilmington, Delaware and Philadelphia), WLVT-TV (Lehigh Valley), and NJTV (New Jersey).[324]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has owned-and-operated stations for five major English-language broadcast networks: NBC – WCAU-TV, CBS – KYW-TV, ABC – WPVI-TV, Fox – WTXF-TV and The CW – WPHL-TV. The major Spanish-language networks are Univision – WUVP-DT, UniMás – WFPA-CD, and Telemundo – WWSI-TV.[324]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the city is the nation's fourth-largest consumer in media market, as ranked by the Nielsen Media Research firm, with nearly 2.9 million TV households.[325]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBroadcast television in the Delaware Valley region\n |\n| --- |\n| This region

Philadelphia\n\nSince at least the 1700s, hundreds of books and articles have been written about Philadelphia's history, culture, sports teams, crime, politics, and other themes related to the city's past, present, and future.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Philadelphia\n\nSee also: 30th Street Station, List of Philadelphia subway stations, and Philadelphia International Airport\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's 30th Street Station serves both SEPTA regional and Amtrak national trains and is Amtrak's third-busiest train station in the nation.\n![](image)A Market–Frankford Line train departing 52nd Street station\nPhiladelphia is served by SEPTA, which operates buses, trains, rapid transit (as both subways and elevated trains), trolleys, and trackless trolleys (electric buses) throughout Philadelphia, the four Pennsylvania suburban counties of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery, in addition to service to Mercer County, New Jersey (Trenton) and New Castle County, Delaware (Wilmington and Newark, Delaware).[326] The city's subway system consists of two routes: the subway section of the Market–Frankford Line running east–west under Market Street which opened in 1905 to the west and 1908 to the east of City Hall,[327] and the Broad Street Line running north–south beneath Broad Street which opened in stages from 1928 to 1938.[328]\n\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, large sections of the SEPTA Regional Rail service to the far suburbs of Philadelphia were discontinued due to a lack of funding for equipment and infrastructure maintenance.[329][330][331]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's 30th Street Station is a major railroad station on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor with 4.4 million passengers in 2017 making it the third-busiest station in the country after New York City's Pennsylvania Station and Washington's Union Station.[332] 30th Street Station offers access to Amtrak,[333] SEPTA,[334] and NJ Transit lines.[335] Over 12 million SEPTA and NJ Transit rail commuters use the station each year, and more than 100,000 people on an average weekday.[332]\n\n\nThe PATCO Speedline provides rapid transit service to Camden, Collingswood, Westmont, Haddonfield, Woodcrest (Cherry Hill), Ashland (Voorhees), and Lindenwold, New Jersey, from stations on Locust Street between 16th and 15th, 13th and 12th, and 10th and 9th Streets, and on Market Street at 8th Street.[336]\n\n\n\n#### Airports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Philadelphia International Airport\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Philadelphia International Airport, the busiest airport in Pennsylvania and 21st-busiest in the nation\nTwo airports serve Philadelphia: the Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) is 7 mi (11 km) south-southwest of Center City on the boundary with Delaware County, providing scheduled domestic and international air service,[337] while Northeast Philadelphia Airport (PNE) is a general aviation relief airport in Northeast Philadelphia serving general and corporate aviation.[338] Philadelphia International Airport is among the busiest airports in the world measured by traffic movements (i.e., takeoffs and landings).[339] More than 30 million passengers pass through the airport annually on 25 airlines, including all major domestic carriers. The airport has nearly 500 daily departures to more than 120 destinations worldwide.[337] SEPTA's Airport Regional Rail Line provides direct service between Center City railroad stations and Philadelphia International Airport.[340]\n\n\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 9,650 feet (2,940 m) long Benjamin Franklin Bridge spans the Delaware River, connecting Philadelphia and South Jersey\n![](image)The Schuylkill Expressway eastbound at I-676 and US 30, also known as the Vine Street Expressway, in Center City\nWilliam Penn planned Philadelphia with numbered streets traversing north and south, and streets named for trees, such as Chestnut, Walnut, and Mulberry (since renamed Arch Street), traversing east and west. The two main streets were named Broad Street (the north–south artery, since designated Pennsylvania Route 611) and High Street (the east–west artery, since renamed Market Street) converging at Centre Square which later became the site of City Hall.[341]\n\n\nInterstate 95 (the Delaware Expressway) traverses the southern and eastern edges of the city along the Delaware River as the main north–south controlled-access highway, connecting Philadelphia with Newark, New Jersey and New York City to the north and with Baltimore and Washington, D.C. southward. The city is also served by Interstate 76 (the Schuylkill Expressway), which runs along the Schuylkill River, intersecting the Pennsylvania Turnpike at King of Prussia and providing access to Harrisburg and points west. Interstate 676 (the Vine Street Expressway) links I-95 and I-76 through Center City by running below street level between the eastbound and westbound lanes of Vine Street. Entrance and exit ramps for the Benjamin Franklin Bridge are near the eastern end of the expressway, just west of the I-95 interchange.[342]\n\n\nThe Roosevelt Boulevard and Expressway (U.S. 1) connect Northeast Philadelphia with Center City via I-76 through Fairmount Park. Woodhaven Road (Route 63) and Cottman Avenue (Route 73) serve the neighborhoods of Northeast Philadelphia, running between I-95 and the Roosevelt Boulevard. The Fort Washington Expressway (Route 309) extends north from the city's northern border, serving Montgomery County and Bucks County. U.S. Route 30 (Lancaster Avenue) extends westward from West Philadelphia to Lancaster.[342]\n\n\nInterstate 476 (locally referred to as the Blue Route[343]) traverses Delaware County, bypassing the city to the west and serving the city's western suburbs, and provides a direct route to Allentown and points north, including the Poconos. Interstate 276, the Pennsylvania Turnpike's Delaware River extension, is a bypass and commuter route to the north of the city and a link to the New Jersey Turnpike and New York City.[342]\n\n\nThe Delaware River Port Authority operates four bridges in the Philadelphia area across the Delaware River to New Jersey: the Walt Whitman Bridge (I-76), the Benjamin Franklin Bridge (I-676 and U.S. 30), the Betsy Ross Bridge (New Jersey Route 90), and the Commodore Barry Bridge (U.S. 322 in Delaware County, south of the city).[344] The Burlington County Bridge Commission maintains two bridges across the Delaware River: the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge which connects PA Route 73 in the Tacony section of Northeast Philadelphia with New Jersey Route 73 in Palmyra, Burlington County, and the Burlington–Bristol Bridge which connects NJ Route 413/U.S. Route 130 in Burlington, New Jersey with PA Route 413/U.S. 13 in Bristol Township, north of Philadelphia.[345]\n\n\n\n#### Bus service[edit]\n\n\nThe Greyhound terminal is at 1001 Filbert Street (at 10th Street) in Center City, southeast of the Pennsylvania Convention Center and south of Chinatown.[346] Several other bus operators provide service at the Greyhound terminal including Fullington Trailways,[347] Martz Trailways,[348] Peter Pan Bus Lines,[349] and NJ Transit buses.[350]\n\n\nOther intercity bus services include Megabus with stops at 30th Street Station and the visitor center for Independence Hall,[351] BoltBus (operated by Greyhound) at 30th Street Station,[352] OurBus at various stops in the city.\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of rail transport in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Suburban Station with art deco architecture at 16th Street and JFK Boulevard\nSince the early days of rail transportation in the United States, Philadelphia has served as a hub for several major rail companies, particularly the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Railroad. The Pennsylvania Railroad first operated Broad Street Station, then 30th Street Station and Suburban Station, and the Reading Railroad operated Reading Terminal, now part of the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The two companies also operated competing commuter rail systems in the area. The two systems now operate as a single system under the control of SEPTA, the regional transit authority. Additionally, the PATCO Speedline subway system and NJ Transit's Atlantic City Line operate successor services to southern New Jersey.[353]\n\n\nIn 1911, Philadelphia had nearly 4,000 electric trolleys running on 86 lines.[354] In 2005, SEPTA reintroduced trolley service to the Girard Avenue Line, Route 15.[355] SEPTA operates six subway-surface trolleys that run on street-level tracks in West Philadelphia and subway tunnels in Center City, along with two surface trolleys in adjacent suburbs.[356]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a regional hub of the federally-owned Amtrak system, with 30th Street Station being a primary stop on the Washington-Boston Northeast Corridor and the Keystone Corridor to Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. 30th Street also serves as a major station for services via the Pennsylvania Railroad's former Pennsylvania Main Line to Chicago. As of 2018[update], 30th Street is Amtrak's third-busiest station in the country, after New York City and Washington.[159]\n\n\n\n#### Walk Score ranks[edit]\n\n\nA 2017 study by Walk Score ranked Philadelphia the fifth-most walkable major city in the United States with a score of 79 out of 100, in the middle of the \"very walkable\" range. The city was just edged out by fourth place Miami (79.2), with the top three cities being New York, San Francisco, and Boston. Philadelphia placed fifth in the public transit friendly category, behind Washington, D.C., with the same three cities for walkability topping this category. The city ranked tenth in the bike friendly cities category, with the top three cities being Minneapolis, San Francisco and Portland.[357]\n\n\n*USA Today* readers voted the Schuylkill River Trail the best urban trail in the nation in 2015.[358]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\n#### Water purity and availability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fairmount Water Works, Philadelphia's second municipal waterworks, in December 1984\nIn 1815, Philadelphia began sourcing its water via the Fairmount Water Works on the Schuylkill River, the nation's first major urban water supply system. In 1909, the Water Works was decommissioned as the city transitioned to modern sand filtration methods.[359] Today, the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) provides drinking water, wastewater collection, and stormwater services for Philadelphia, as well as surrounding counties. PWD draws about 57 percent of its drinking water from the Delaware River and the balance from the Schuylkill River.[360] The city has two filtration plants on the Schuylkill River and one on the Delaware River. The three plants can treat up to 546 million gallons of water per day, while the total storage capacity of the combined plant and distribution system exceeds one billion gallons. The wastewater system consists of three water pollution control plants, 21 pumping stations, and about 3,657 miles (5,885 km) of sewers.[360]\n\n\n\n#### Electricity[edit]\n\n\nExelon subsidiary PECO Energy Company, founded as the Brush Electric Light Company of Philadelphia in 1881 and renamed Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) in 1902, provides electricity to about 1.6 million customers and more than 500,000 natural gas customers in the southeastern Pennsylvania area including the city of Philadelphia and most of its suburbs.[361] PECO is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state with 472 power substations and nearly 23,000 miles (37,000 km) of electric transmission and distribution lines, along with 12,000 miles (19,000 km) of natural gas transmission, distribution & service lines.[362]\n\n\n\n#### Natural gas[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Philadelphia Gas Works\n\nPhiladelphia Gas Works (PGW), overseen by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, is the nation's largest municipally-owned natural gas utility. PGW serves over 500,000 homes and businesses in the Philadelphia area.[363] Founded in 1836, the company came under city ownership in 1987 and has been providing the majority of gas distributed within city limits. In 2014, the City Council refused to conduct hearings on a $1.86 billion sale of PGW, part of a two-year effort that was proposed by the mayor. The refusal led to the prospective buyer terminating its offer.[364][365]\n\n\n\n#### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Area codes 215, 267, and 445\n\nSoutheastern Pennsylvania was assigned the 215 area code in 1947 when the North American Numbering Plan of the Bell System went into effect. The geographic area covered by the code was split nearly in half in 1994 when area code 610 was created, with the city and its northern suburbs retaining 215. Overlay area code 267 was added to the 215 service area in 1997, and 484 was added to the 610 area in 1999. A plan in 2001 to introduce a third overlay code to both service areas, area code 445 to 215 and area code 835 to 610, was delayed and later rescinded.[366] Area code 445 was implemented as an overlay for area codes 215 and 267 starting on February 3, 2018.[367]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Philadelphia\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Chinatown paifang at 10th and Arch Streets, a symbol of Philadelphia's sister city relationship with Tianjin\n\n\n| City\n | Country\n | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Florence[368] | Italy\n | 1964\n |\n| Tel Aviv[369] | Israel\n | 1966\n |\n| Toruń[370] | Poland\n | 1976\n |\n| Tianjin[371] | China\n | 1979\n |\n| Incheon[372] | South Korea\n | 1984\n |\n| Douala[373] | Cameroon\n | 1986\n |\n| Nizhny Novgorod[374] | Russia\n | 1992\n |\n| Frankfurt[375] | Germany\n | 2015\n |\n\n\nPhiladelphia also has three partnership cities or regions:[376]\n\n\n\n\n\n| City\n | Country\n | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Kobe[377] | Japan\n | 1986\n |\n| Abruzzo[378] | Italy\n | 1997\n |\n| Aix-en-Provence[379] | France\n | 1999\n |\n\n\nPhiladelphia has eight official sister cities as designated by the Citizen Diplomacy International of Philadelphia:[376] Philadelphia has dedicated landmarks to its sister cities. The Sister Cities Park, a site of 0.5 acres (2,400 sq yd) at 18th and Benjamin Franklin Parkway within Logan Square, was dedicated in June 1976. The park was built to commemorate Philadelphia's first two sister city relationships, with Tel Aviv and Florence. The Toruń Triangle, honoring the sister city relationship with Toruń, Poland, was constructed in 1976, west of the United Way building at 18th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Sister Cities Park was redesigned and reopened in 2012, featuring an interactive fountain honoring Philadelphia's sister and partnership cities, a café and visitor's center, children's play area, outdoor garden, and boat pond, as well as a pavilion built to environmentally friendly standards.[380][381]\n\n\nThe Chinatown Gate, erected in 1984 and crafted by artisans of Tianjin, stands astride 10th Street, on the north side of its intersection with Arch Street, as a symbol of the sister city relationship. The CDI of Philadelphia has participated in the U.S. Department of State's \"Partners for Peace\" project with Mosul, Iraq,[382] as well as accepting visiting delegations from dozens of other countries.[383]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n* ![](image)Philadelphia portal\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* List of Pennsylvania state historical markers in Philadelphia County\n* Metropolitan areas in the Americas\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Philadelphia\n* USS *Philadelphia*, 6 ships\n* Alaşehir, ancient Philadelphia in Turkey\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Description of the Lenape peoples (Delaware nations) historic territories inside the divides of the frequently mountainous landforms flanking the Delaware River's drainage basin.

The February 2010 storms contributed to a single month record accumulation of 51.5 in (131 cm). If no snow fell outside of February that season, 2009–10 would still rank as 5th-snowiest. See the Franklin Institute for a visual representation of seasonal snowfall.\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n4. **^** Official temperature and precipitation measurements for Philadelphia were taken at the Weather Bureau Office in downtown from January 1872 to 19 June 1940, and at Philadelphia Int'l from 20 June 1940 to the present.[111] Snowfall and snow depth records date to 1 January 1884 and 1 October 1948, respectively.[105] In 2006, snowfall measurements were moved to National Park, New Jersey directly across the Delaware River from the airport.[112]\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** From 15% sample\n6. **^** E.g., in the opening chapter of *The Handbook of Language Variation and Change* (ed.

It is one of the most historically significant cities in the United States and served as the nation's capital until 1800.[13] Philadelphia is the nation's sixth-most populous city with a population of 1,603,797 as of the 2020 census. Since 1854, the city has been coextensive with Philadelphia County, the most populous county in Pennsylvania. Philadelphia serves as the urban core of the larger Delaware Valley (or Philadelphia metropolitan area), the nation's seventh-largest and one of the world's largest metropolitan regions consisting of 6.245 million residents in the metropolitan statistical area and 7.366 million residents in its combined statistical area.[14] Philadelphia is known for its extensive contributions to American history, especially the American Revolution, and for its contemporary influence in business and industry, culture, sports, and music.[15][16]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was founded in 1682 by William Penn, an English Quaker and advocate of religious freedom. The city served as the capital of the Pennsylvania Colony during the British colonial era[5][17] and went on to play a historic and vital role as the central meeting place for the nation's founding fathers whose plans and actions in Philadelphia ultimately inspired the American Revolution and the nation's independence following the Revolutionary War. Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress in 1774, preserved the Liberty Bell, and hosted the Second Continental Congress during which the founders signed the Declaration of Independence, which historian Joseph Ellis has described as \"the most potent and consequential words in American history\".[18] Once the Revolutionary War commenced, the Battle of Germantown and the siege of Fort Mifflin were fought within Philadelphia's city limits. The U.S. Constitution was later ratified in Philadelphia at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until 1790, when it was surpassed by New York City, and it served as the nation's first capital from May 10, 1775, until December 12, 1776, and on four subsequent occasions during and following the American Revolution, including from 1790 to 1800 during the construction of the new national capital of Washington, D.C.\n\n\nWith 18 four-year universities and colleges, Philadelphia is one of the nation's leading centers for higher education and academic research.[19][20] As of 2018[update], the Philadelphia metropolitan area was the state's largest and nation's ninth-largest metropolitan economy with a gross metropolitan product of US$444.1 billion. The city is home to five Fortune 500 corporate headquarters as of 2022.[21] As of 2023, metropolitan Philadelphia ranks among the top five U.S. venture capital centers, facilitated by its proximity to New York City's entrepreneurial and financial ecosystems.[22] The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, owned by Nasdaq since 2008, is the nation's oldest stock exchange and a global leader in options trading.[23] 30th Street Station, the city's primary rail station, is the third-busiest Amtrak hub in the nation, and the city's multimodal transport and logistics infrastructure, includes Philadelphia International Airport, and the rapidly-growing PhilaPort seaport.[24] A migration pattern has been established from New York City to Philadelphia by residents opting for a large city with relative proximity and a lower cost of living.[25][26]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a national cultural center, hosting more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other city in the nation.[27][28] Fairmount Park, when combined with adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park in the same watershed, is 2,052 acres (830 ha), representing one of the nation's largest and the world's 45th-largest urban park.[29] The city is known for its arts, culture, cuisine, and colonial and Revolution-era history; in 2016, it attracted 42 million domestic tourists who spent $6.8 billion, representing $11 billion in economic impact to the city and its surrounding Pennsylvania counties.[30]\n\n\nWith five professional sports teams and one of the nation's most loyal fan bases, Philadelphia is often ranked as the nation's best city for professional sports fans.[31][32][33][34] The city has a culturally and philanthropically active LGBTQ+ community. Philadelphia also has played an immensely influential historic and ongoing role in the development and evolution of American music, especially R&B, soul, and rock.[35][36]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a city of many firsts, including the nation's first library (1731),[37] hospital (1751),[37] medical school (1765),[38] national capital (1774),[39] university (by some accounts) (1779),[40] stock exchange (1790),[37] zoo (1874),[41] and business school (1881).[42] Philadelphia contains 67 National Historic Landmarks, including Independence Hall.[43][44][20] From the city's 17th century founding through the present, Philadelphia has been the birthplace or home to an extensive number of prominent and influential Americans. In 2021, *Time* magazine named Philadelphia one of the world's greatest 100 places.[45]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Philadelphia\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Philadelphia.\n\nSee also: List of National Historic Landmarks in Philadelphia and National Register of Historic Places listings in Philadelphia\n\n### Native peoples[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 17th century, the Philadelphia area was home to the Lenape (Delaware) Indians in the village of Shackamaxon. They were also called the Delaware Indians,[46] and their historical territory was along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley.[a] Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts.[46] Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly smallpox, and conflict with Europeans. The Iroquois occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper Ohio River basin. The American Revolutionary War and the United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory to present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territories under the Indian removal policy.\n\n\n\n### Colonial[edit]\n\n\n![](image)William Penn (holding paper) and King Charles II depicted in *The Birth of Pennsylvania*, an 1680 portrait by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris\n![A Portraiture of the City of Philadelphia, by Thomas Holme](image)A 1683 portrait of Philadelphia by Thomas Holme that is believed to be the city's first map\n![](image)William Penn's 1682 Treaty of Shackamaxon with the Lenape tribe depicted in *Penn's Treaty with the Indians*, a 1772 portrait by Benjamin West\nEuropeans came to the Delaware Valley in the early 17th century. The first settlements were founded by Dutch colonists, who built Fort Nassau on the Delaware River in 1623 in what is now Brooklawn, New Jersey. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their New Netherland colony. In 1638, Swedish settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of New Sweden at Fort Christina, located in present-day Wilmington, Delaware, and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the Susquehannocks in their war against Maryland colonists.[47] In 1648, the Dutch built Fort Beversreede on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill River near the present-day Eastwick section of Philadelphia, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building Fort Nya Korsholm, or New Korsholm, named after a town in Finland with a Swedish majority. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General Peter Stuyvesant took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence. The Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. An English fleet captured the New Netherland colony in 1664, though the situation did not change substantially until 1682, when the area was included in William Penn's charter for Pennsylvania.[48]\n\n\nIn 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, Charles II of England granted Penn a charter for what would become the Pennsylvania colony. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape in an effort to establish good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for the colony.[49] Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon, in what is now the city's Fishtown neighborhood.[5] Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for \"brotherly love\", derived from the Ancient Greek terms φίλος *phílos* (beloved, dear) and ἀδελφός *adelphós* (brother, brotherly). There were a number of cities named *Philadelphia* in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Greek and Roman periods, including modern Alaşehir, mentioned as the site of an early Christian congregation in the Book of Revelation. As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, which exceeded that of other colonies, led to better relations with the local native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city.[50]\n\n\nPenn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a grid plan to keep houses and businesses spread far apart with areas for gardens and orchards.\n\n\nThe city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, however, and instead crowded the present-day Port of Philadelphia on the Delaware River and subdivided and resold their lots.[51] Before Penn left Philadelphia for the final time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city. Though poor at first, Philadelphia became an important trading center with tolerable living conditions by the 1750s. Benjamin Franklin, a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones that were among the first in the nation, including a fire company, library, and hospital.\n\n\nA number of philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life, including the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the Academy of Natural Sciences (1812), and the Franklin Institute (1824).[52] These societies developed and financed new industries that attracted skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe.\n\n\n\n### American Revolution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution and Philadelphia campaign\n\n![](image)The Committee of Five presenting their draft of the Declaration of Independence in Independence Hall on June 28, 1776, depicted in an 1818 painting by John Trumbull; historian Joseph Ellis called the Declaration \"the most potent and consequential words in American history.\"[53]\n![](image)President's House on Market Street served as the presidential mansion for the nation's first two presidents, George Washington and John Adams, from 1790 to 1800 prior to the completion of the White House and the development of Washington, D.C. as the nation's new capital\n![](image)Independence Hall on Chestnut Street between 5th and 6th Streets, where the Declaration of Independence was signed and the Constitution was ratified, on July 4, 1776, and June 21, 1788, respectively\nPhiladelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for America's revolutionaries. By the 1750s, Philadelphia surpassed Boston as the largest city and busiest port in British America, and the second-largest city in the entire British Empire after London.[54][55] In 1774, as resentment of British colonial practices and support for independence was burgeoning in the colonies, Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress.\n\n\nFrom 1775 to 1781, Philadelphia hosted the Second Continental Congress,[56] which adopted the Declaration of Independence in what was then called the Pennsylvania State House and was later renamed Independence Hall. Historian Joseph Ellis, in 2007, described the Declaration of Independence, written predominantly by Thomas Jefferson, as \"the most potent and consequential words in American history,\"[18] and its adoption represented a declaration of war against the British Army, which was then the world's most powerful military force. Since the Declaration's July 4, 1776, adoption, its signing has been cited globally and repeatedly by various peoples of the world seeking independence and liberty. It also has been, since its adoption, the basis for annual celebration by Americans; in 1938, this celebration of the Declaration was formalized as Independence Day, one of only ten designated U.S. federal holidays.\n\n\nAfter George Washington's defeat at the Battle of Brandywine in Chadds Ford Township, on September 11, 1777, during the Philadelphia campaign, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless and the city prepared for what was perceived to be an inevitable British attack. Because bells could easily be recast into munitions, the Liberty Bell, then known as the Pennsylvania State Bell, and bells from two Philadelphia churches, Christ Church and St. Peter's Church, were hastily taken down and transported by heavily guarded wagon train out of the city. The Liberty Bell was taken to Zion German Reformed Church in Northampton Town, which is present-day Allentown, where it was hidden under the church's floor boards for nine months from September 1777 until the British Army's departure from Philadelphia in June 1778.[57] Two Revolutionary War battles, the Siege of Fort Mifflin, fought between September 26 and November 16, 1777, and the Battle of Germantown, fought on October 4, 1777, took place within Philadelphia's city limits.\n\n\nIn Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation on November 15, 1777, and the city later served as the meeting place for the Constitutional Convention, which ratified the Constitution in Independence Hall in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787.\n\n\nPhiladelphia served as capital of the United States for much of the colonial and early post-colonial periods, including for a decade, from 1790 to 1800, while Washington, D.C., was being constructed and prepared to serve as the new national capital.[58] In 1793, the largest yellow fever epidemic in U.S. history killed approximately 4,000 to 5,000 people in Philadelphia, or about ten percent of the city's population at the time.[59][60] The capital of the United States was moved to Washington, D.C. in 1800 upon completion of the White House and U.S. Capitol buildings.\n\n\nThe state capital was moved from Philadelphia to Lancaster in 1799, then ultimately to Harrisburg in 1812 Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until the late 18th century. It also was the nation's financial and cultural center until ultimately being eclipsed in total population by New York City in 1790. In 1816, the city's free Black community founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent Black denomination in the country, and the first Black Episcopal Church. The free Black community also established many schools for its children with the help of Quakers. Large-scale construction projects for new roads, canals, and railroads made Philadelphia the first major industrial city in the United States.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\n![](image)Loan of the City of Philadelphia, issued March 7, 1866\n![](image)Opening day ceremonies at the Centennial Exposition at Memorial Hall in Fairmount Park in 1876, the first world fair held in the U.S. on the centennial anniversary of the nation's founding\nThroughout the 19th century, Philadelphia hosted a variety of industries and businesses; the largest was the textile industry. Major corporations in the 19th and early 20th centuries included the Baldwin Locomotive Works, William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company, and the Pennsylvania Railroad.[61] Established in 1870, the Philadelphia Conveyancers' Association was chartered by the state in 1871. Along with the U.S. Centennial in 1876, the city's industry was celebrated in the Centennial Exposition, the first official World's fair in the U.S.\n\n\nImmigrants, mostly from Ireland and Germany, settled in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts. These immigrants were largely responsible for the first general strike in North America in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday. The city was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine in the 1840s; housing for them was developed south of South Street and later occupied by succeeding immigrants. They established a network of Catholic churches and schools and dominated the Catholic clergy for decades. Anti-Irish, anti-Catholic nativist riots erupted in Philadelphia in 1844. The rise in population of the surrounding districts helped lead to the Act of Consolidation of 1854, which extended the city limits from the 2 square miles (5.2 km2) of Center City to the roughly 134 square miles (350 km2) of Philadelphia County.[62][63]\nIn the latter half of the 19th century and leading into the 20th century, immigrants from Russia, Eastern Europe, and Italy, and African Americans from the southern U.S. settled in the city.[64]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was represented by the Washington Grays in the American Civil War. The African-American population of Philadelphia increased from 31,699 to 219,559 between 1880 and 1930.[65][66] Black newcomers in the 20th century were part of the Great Migration out of the rural south and into northern and midwestern industrial cities.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chestnut Street in Center City at night in February 2016\nBy the 20th century, Philadelphia had an entrenched Republican political machine and a complacent population.[67] In 1910, a general strike shut down the entire city.[68]\n\n\nIn 1917, following outrage over the election-year murder of a Philadelphia police officer, led to the shrinking of the City Council from two houses to just one.[69] In July 1919, Philadelphia was one of more than 36 industrial cities nationally to suffer a race riot during Red Summer in post-World War I unrest as recent immigrants competed with Blacks for jobs. In the 1920s, the public flouting of Prohibition laws, organized crime, mob violence, and corrupt police involvement in illegal activities led to the appointment of Brig. Gen. Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps as the city's director of public safety, but political pressure still prevented long-term success in fighting crime and corruption.[70]\n\n\nIn 1940, non-Hispanic whites constituted 86.8% of the city's population.[71] In 1950, the population peaked at more than two million residents, then began to decline with the restructuring of industry that led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs. In addition, suburbanization enticed many affluent residents to depart the city for its outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. The resulting reduction in Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government caused the city to struggle through a long period of adjustment, and it approached bankruptcy by the late 1980s.[72][73]\n\n\nIn 1985, the MOVE Bombing of the Cobbs Creek neighborhood by city helicopters occurred, killing 11 and destroying 61 homes.[74]\n\n\nRevitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century with much of the development occurring in the Center City and University City neighborhoods. But this expanded a shortage of affordable housing in the city. After many manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down, the city started attracting service businesses and began to market itself more aggressively as a tourist destination. Contemporary glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the 1980s. Historic areas such as Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s, making both areas among the most desirable Center City neighborhoods. Immigrants from around the world began to enter the U.S. through Philadelphia as their gateway, leading to a reversal of the city's population decline between 1950 and 2000, during which it lost about 25 percent of its residents.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia eventually began experiencing a growth in its population in 2007, which continued with gradual yearly increases through the present.[77][78]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's geographic center is about 40° 0′ 34″ north latitude and 75° 8′ 0″ west longitude. The 40th parallel north passes through neighborhoods in Northeast Philadelphia, North Philadelphia, and West Philadelphia including Fairmount Park. The city encompasses 142.71 square miles (369.62 km2), of which 134.18 square miles (347.52 km2) is land and 8.53 square miles (22.09 km2), or 6%, is water.[79] Natural bodies of water include the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, lakes in Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park, and Cobbs, Wissahickon, and Pennypack creeks. The largest artificial body of water is East Park Reservoir in Fairmount Park.\n\n\nThe lowest point is sea level and the highest point is in Chestnut Hill about 446 feet (136 m) above sea level on Summit Street near the intersection of Germantown Avenue and Bethlehem Pike at: 40.07815 N, 75.20747 W.[80][81] Philadelphia is located on the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line that separates the Atlantic Plain from the Piedmont.[82] The Schuylkill River's rapids at East Falls were inundated by completion of the dam at Fairmount Water Works.[83]\n\n\nThe city is the seat of its own county. The city is bordered by six adjacent counties: Montgomery to the northwest; Bucks to the north and northeast; Burlington County, New Jersey to the east; Camden County, New Jersey to the southeast; Gloucester County, New Jersey to the south; and Delaware County to the southwest.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of Philadelphia and List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)\nThe skyline of Philadelphia seen from the northwest on the Spring Garden Street Bridge over the Schuylkill River in April 2018 (annotated version)\n\n![](image)\nPhiladelphia's skyline at twilight from the southwest on the South Street Bridge with the Schuylkill River on the left in July 2016 (annotated version)\n\n#### City planning[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Philadelphia neighborhoods\n\nPhiladelphia was created in the 17th century following the plan by William Penn's surveyor Thomas Holme. Center City is structured with long, straight streets running nearly due east–west and north–south, forming a grid pattern between the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers that is aligned with their courses. The original city plan was designed to allow for easy travel and to keep residences separated by open space that would help prevent the spread of fire.[84] In keeping with the idea of a \"Greene Countrie Towne\", and inspired by the many types of trees that grew in the region, Penn named many of the east–west streets for local trees.[85] Penn planned the creation of five public parks in the city which were renamed in 1824.[84] Centre Square was renamed Penn Square;[86] Northeast Square was renamed Franklin Square; Southeast Square was renamed Washington Square; Southwest Square was renamed Rittenhouse Square; and Northwest Square was renamed Logan Circle/Square.[87] Center City had an estimated 183,240 residents as of 2015[update], making it the second-most populated downtown area in the United States after Midtown Manhattan in New York City.[88]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's neighborhoods are divided into six large sections that surround Center City: North Philadelphia, Northeast Philadelphia, South Philadelphia, Southwest Philadelphia, West Philadelphia, and Northwest Philadelphia. The city's geographic boundaries have been largely unchanged since these neighborhoods were consolidated in 1854. However, each of these large areas contains numerous neighborhoods, some of whose boundaries derive from the boroughs, townships, and other communities that constituted Pennsylvania County before their inclusion within the city.[89]\n\n\nThe City Planning Commission, tasked with guiding growth and development of the city, has divided the city into 18 planning districts as part of the *Philadelphia2035* physical development plan.[90][91] Much of the city's 1980 zoning code was overhauled from 2007 to 2012 as part of a joint effort between former mayors John F. Street and Michael Nutter. The zoning changes were intended to rectify incorrect zoning maps to facilitate future community development, as the city forecasts an additional 100,000 residents and 40,000 jobs will be added by 2035.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) is the largest landlord in Pennsylvania. Established in 1937, the PHA is the nation's fourth-largest housing authority, serving about 81,000 people with affordable housing, while employing 1,400 on a budget of $371 million.[92] The Philadelphia Parking Authority is responsible for ensuring adequate parking for city residents, businesses, and visitors.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Architecture of Philadelphia and List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Philadelphia City Hall at night in December 2012\n![](image)Two of Center City Philadelphia's most prominent high-rise buildings, One Liberty Place, built between 1985 and 1987 (in background), and Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901 (in foreground)\nPhiladelphia's architectural history dates back to colonial times and includes a wide range of styles. The earliest structures were constructed with logs, but brick structures were common by 1700. During the 18th century, the cityscape was dominated by Georgian architecture, including Independence Hall and Christ Church.\n\n\nIn the first decades of the 19th century, Federal and Greek Revival architecture were the dominant styles produced by Philadelphia architects such as Benjamin Latrobe, William Strickland, John Haviland, John Notman, Thomas Walter, and Samuel Sloan.[94] Frank Furness is considered Philadelphia's greatest architect of the second half of the 19th century. His contemporaries included John McArthur Jr., Addison Hutton, Wilson Eyre, the Wilson Brothers, and Horace Trumbauer. In 1871, construction began on the Second Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall. The Philadelphia Historical Commission was created in 1955 to preserve the cultural and architectural history of the city. The commission maintains the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places, adding historic buildings, structures, sites, objects and districts as it sees fit.[95]\n\n\nIn 1932, Philadelphia became home to the first modern International Style skyscraper in the United States, the PSFS Building, designed by George Howe and William Lescaze. The 548 ft (167 m) City Hall remained the tallest building in the city until 1987 when One Liberty Place was completed. Numerous glass and granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the late 1980s. In 2007, the Comcast Center surpassed One Liberty Place to become the city's tallest building. The Comcast Technology Center was completed in 2018, reaching a height of 1,121 ft (342 m), as the tallest building in the United States outside of Manhattan and Chicago.[96]\n\n\nFor much of Philadelphia's history, the typical home has been the row house. The row house was introduced to the United States via Philadelphia in the early 19th century and, for a time, row houses built elsewhere in the United States were known as \"Philadelphia rows\".[94] A variety of row houses are found throughout the city, from Federal-style continuous blocks in Old City and Society Hill to Victorian-style homes in North Philadelphia to twin row houses in West Philadelphia. While newer homes have been built recently, much of the housing dates to the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, which has created problems such as urban decay and vacant lots. Some neighborhoods, including Northern Liberties and Society Hill, have been rehabilitated through gentrification.[97][98]\n\n\n\n* ![Elfreth's Alley, first developed in 1703, is the nation's oldest residential street.[99]](image)\n\nElfreth's Alley, first developed in 1703, is the nation's oldest residential street.[99]\n* ![Carpenters' Hall, built between 1770 and 1774 in Georgian architecture style](image)\n\nCarpenters' Hall, built between 1770 and 1774 in Georgian architecture style\n* ![The Second Bank of the United States, built between 1818 and 1824, exhibiting Greek Revival architecture](image)\n\nThe Second Bank of the United States, built between 1818 and 1824, exhibiting Greek Revival architecture\n* ![Second Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901, on South Broad Street](image)\n\nSecond Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901, on South Broad Street\n* ![The Art Deco-style grand concourse at 30th Street Station, one of the nation's busiest passenber train stations, built between 1927 and 1933](image)\n\nThe Art Deco-style grand concourse at 30th Street Station, one of the nation's busiest passenber train stations, built between 1927 and 1933\n\n\n#### Parks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Drinking fountains in Philadelphia, Fairmount Park, and List of parks in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's Fairmount Park on the Schuylkill River, the city's largest and one of the world's largest public parks\nAs of 2014[update], the city's total park space, including municipal, state, and federal parks in the city, amounts to 11,211 acres (17.5 sq mi).[29] Philadelphia's largest park is Fairmount Park, which includes the Philadelphia Zoo and encompasses 2,052 acres (3.2 sq mi) of the total parkland. Fairmount Park's adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park contains 2,042 acres (3.2 sq mi).[100] Fairmount Park, when combined with Wissahickon Valley Park, is one of the largest contiguous urban park areas in the U.S.[29] The two parks, along with the Colonial Revival, Georgian and Federal-style mansions in them, have been listed as one entity on the National Register of Historic Places since 1972.[101]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 3.1\n\n\n\n41\n\n26\n | 2.8\n\n\n\n44\n\n28\n | 4\n\n\n\n53\n\n34\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n65\n\n44\n | 3.3\n\n\n\n74\n\n54\n | 4\n\n\n\n83\n\n64\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n88\n\n70\n | 4.3\n\n\n\n86\n\n68\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n79\n\n61\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n67\n\n49\n | 2.9\n\n\n\n56\n\n39\n | 4\n\n\n\n46\n\n31\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Metric conversion |\n| --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 80\n\n\n\n5\n\n−3\n | 70\n\n\n\n7\n\n−3\n | 101\n\n\n\n12\n\n1\n | 88\n\n\n\n18\n\n7\n | 85\n\n\n\n24\n\n12\n | 103\n\n\n\n28\n\n18\n | 111\n\n\n\n31\n\n21\n | 109\n\n\n\n30\n\n20\n | 112\n\n\n\n26\n\n16\n | 88\n\n\n\n20\n\n10\n | 74\n\n\n\n13\n\n4\n | 101\n\n\n\n8\n\n0\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification, Philadelphia falls under the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen *Cfa*),[102] whereas according to the Trewartha climate classification, the city has a temperate maritime climate (*Do*) limited to the north by the continental climate (*Dc*).[103] Summers are typically hot and muggy, fall and spring are generally mild, and winter is moderately cold. The plant life hardiness zones are 7a and 7b, representing an average annual extreme minimum temperature between 0 and 10 °F (−18 and −12 °C).[104]\n\n\nSnowfall is highly variable, with some winters experiencing only light snow, while others include major snowstorms. The normal seasonal snowfall averages 22.4 in (57 cm), with rare snowfalls in November or April, and rarely any sustained snow cover.[105] Seasonal snowfall accumulation has ranged from trace amounts in 1972–73 to 78.7 inches (200 cm) in the winter of 2009–10.[105][b] The city's heaviest single-storm snowfall was 30.7 in (78 cm) which occurred in January 1996.[106]\n\n\nPrecipitation is generally spread throughout the year, with eight to eleven wet days per month,[107] at an average annual rate of 44.1 inches (1,120 mm), but historically ranging from 29.31 in (744 mm) in 1922 to 64.33 in (1,634 mm) in 2011.[105] The most rain recorded in one day occurred on July 28, 2013, when 8.02 in (204 mm) fell at Philadelphia International Airport.[105] Philadelphia has a moderately sunny climate with an average of 2,498 hours of sunshine annually, and a percentage of sunshine ranging from 47% in December to 61% in June, July, and August.[108]\n\n\nThe January daily average temperature is 33.7 °F (0.9 °C), though the temperature frequently rises to 50 °F (10 °C) during thaws. July averages 78.7 °F (25.9 °C), although heat waves accompanied by high humidity and heat indices are frequent, with highs reaching or exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) on 30 days of the year. The average window for freezing temperatures is November 6 thru April 2,[105] allowing a growing season of 217 days. Early fall and late winter are generally dry with February having the lowest average precipitation at 2.75 inches (70 mm).

Many smaller CSAs were also ranked higher for ozone including Sacramento (8th), Las Vegas (10th), Denver (11th), El Paso (16th), and Salt Lake City (20th); however, only two of those same ten CSAs—San Jose and Los Angeles—were ranked higher than Philadelphia for both year-round and short-term particle pollution.[117]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Chinese in Philadelphia; History of Irish Americans in Philadelphia; History of Italian Americans in Philadelphia; Koreans in Philadelphia; Little Saigon, Philadelphia; History of Jews in Philadelphia; LGBT culture in Philadelphia; and Puerto Ricans in Philadelphia\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1683 | 600 | —     |\n| 1731 | 12,000 | +1900.0% |\n| 1790 | 28,522 | +137.7% |\n| 1800 | 41,220 | +44.5% |\n| 1810 | 53,722 | +30.3% |\n| 1820 | 63,802 | +18.8% |\n| 1830 | 80,462 | +26.1% |\n| 1840 | 93,665 | +16.4% |\n| 1850 | 121,376 | +29.6% |\n| 1860 | 565,529 | +365.9% |\n| 1870 | 674,022 | +19.2% |\n| 1880 | 847,170 | +25.7% |\n| 1890 | 1,046,964 | +23.6% |\n| 1900 | 1,293,697 | +23.6% |\n| 1910 | 1,549,008 | +19.7% |\n| 1920 | 1,823,779 | +17.7% |\n| 1930 | 1,950,961 | +7.0% |\n| 1940 | 1,931,334 | −1.0% |\n| 1950 | 2,071,605 | +7.3% |\n| 1960 | 2,002,512 | −3.3% |\n| 1970 | 1,948,609 | −2.7% |\n| 1980 | 1,688,210 | −13.4% |\n| 1990 | 1,585,577 | −6.1% |\n| 2000 | 1,517,550 | −4.3% |\n| 2010 | 1,526,006 | +0.6% |\n| 2020 | 1,603,797 | +5.1% |\n| 2022 | 1,567,258 | −2.3% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[118]2010–2020[12]Source: U.S. Decennial Census[119] |\n\n\nAccording to the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau's tabulation, there were 1,603,797 people residing in Philadelphia, representing a 1.2% increase from the 2019 census estimate.[78] The racial composition of the city was 39.3% Black alone (42.0% Black alone or in combination), 36.3% White alone (41.9% White alone or in combination), 8.7% Asian alone, 0.4% American Indian and Alaska Native alone, 8.7% some other race, and 6.9% multiracial. 14.9% of residents were Hispanic or Latino. 34.8% had a bachelor's degree or higher. 23.9% spoke a language other than English at home, the most common of which was Spanish (10.8%). 15.0% of the populations foreign born, roughly half of whom are naturalized U.S. citizens. 3.7% of the population are veterans. The median household income was $52,889 and 22.8% of the population lived in poverty. 49.5% of the population drove alone to work, while 23.2% used public transit, 8.2% carpooled, 7.9% walked, and 7.0% worked from home. The average commute is 31 minutes.[120]\n\n\nAfter the 1950 census, when a record high of 2,071,605 was recorded, the city's population began a long decline. The population dropped to a low of 1,488,710 residents in 2006 before beginning to rise again. Between 2006 and 2017, Philadelphia added 92,153 residents. In 2017, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the racial composition of the city was 41.3% Black (non-Hispanic), 34.9% White (non-Hispanic), 14.1% Hispanic or Latino, 7.1% Asian, 0.4% Native American, 0.05% Pacific Islander, and 2.8% multiracial.[121]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Census racial composition | 2020[120] | 2010[122] | 2000 | 1990[123] | 1980[123] | 1970[123] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Black or African American (non-Hispanic) | 38.3% | 42.2% | 42.6% | 39.3% | 37.5% | 33.3%[e] |\n| White (non-Hispanic) | 34.3% | 36.9% | 42.5% | 52.1% | 57.1% | 63.8[e] |\n| Hispanic or Latino (of any race) | 14.9% | 12.3% | 8.5% | 5.6% | 3.8% | 2.4%[e] |\n| Asian | 8.3% | 6.3% | 4.5% | 2.7% | 1.1% | 0.3%\n |\n| Pacific Islanders | 0.1% | <0.1% | <0.1% | <0.1%\n |\n| Native Americans | 0.4% | 0.5% | 0.3% | 0.2% | 0.1% | 0.1%\n |\n| Two or more races | 6.9% | 2.8% | 2.2% | n/a[124] | n/a | n/a\n |\n\n\n![](image)Ethnic origins in Philadelphia\n### Immigration and cultural diversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's famed Italian Market in South Philadelphia\n![](image)A Gayborhood street sign near Washington Square\nIn addition to the city's economic growth, the city's population has been fueled by foreign immigration. According to The Pew Charitable Trusts, the city's foreign-born population increased by 69% between 2000 and 2016 to constitute nearly 20% of Philadelphia's workforce,[125] and it doubled between 1990 and 2017 to constitute 13.8% of the city's total population, with the top five countries of origin being China by a significant margin followed by the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, India, and Vietnam.[126]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 countries of origin for foreign-born Philadelphians, 2017[127]\n| Country | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) China | 22,140\n |\n| ![](image) Dominican Republic | 13,792\n |\n| ![](image) Jamaica | 13,500\n |\n| ![](image) India | 11,382\n |\n| ![](image) Vietnam | 10,132\n |\n| ![](image) Haiti | 9,186\n |\n| ![](image) Mexico | 7,823\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | 6,898\n |\n| ![](image) Albania | 5,258\n |\n| ![](image) South Korea/![](image) North Korea | 4,385\n |\n\n\nIrish, Italian, German, Polish, English, Russian, Ukrainian, and French ancestries constitute the largest European ethnic groups in the city.[128] Philadelphia has the second-largest Irish and Italian populations in the United States after New York City. South Philadelphia remains one of the largest Italian neighborhoods in the country and is home to the Italian Market.\n\n\nThe Pennsport neighborhood and Gray's Ferry section of South Philadelphia, home to many Mummer clubs, are well known as Irish neighborhoods. The Kensington, Port Richmond, and Fishtown neighborhoods have historically been heavily Irish and Polish. Port Richmond is a center for the Polish-American community in Philadelphia, and it remains a common destination for Polish immigrants. Northeast Philadelphia, although known for its Irish and Irish-American population, is home to a Jewish and Russian population. Mount Airy in Northwest Philadelphia also contains a Jewish community. Nearby Chestnut Hill is historically known as an Anglo-Saxon Protestant community.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Black American population is the fourth-largest in the country after New York City, Chicago, and Houston. West Philadelphia and North Philadelphia are largely African-American neighborhoods, but many are leaving those areas in favor of the Northeast and Southwest sections of Philadelphia. A higher proportion of African-American Muslims reside in Philadelphia than most other major U.S. cities. West Philadelphia and Southwest Philadelphia are home to various Afro-Caribbean and African immigrant communities.[129]\n\n\nThe Puerto Rican population in Philadelphia is the second-largest on the U.S. mainland after New York City, and the second-fastest growing after Orlando.[130] Eastern North Philadelphia, particularly Fairhill and surrounding areas to the north and east, has one of the highest concentrations of Puerto Ricans outside Puerto Rico, with many large swaths of blocks being close to 100% Puerto Rican.[131][132] Puerto Rican and Dominican populations reside in North Philadelphia and the Northeast, and Mexican and Central American populations exist in South Philadelphia.[133] South American migrants were being transported by bus from Texas to Philadelphia beginning in 2022.[134]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Asian American population includes those of Chinese, Indians, Vietnamese, South Koreans, and Filipinos. Over 35,000 Chinese Americans lived in the city in 2015,[135] including a Fuzhounese population. Center City hosts a Chinatown that is served by Chinatown bus lines with service to/from Chinatown, Manhattan.[136] A Korean community initially settled in the North Philadelphia neighborhood of Olney; however, the primary Koreatown has subsequently shifted further north, straddling the city's border with adjacent Cheltenham in Montgomery County and Cherry Hill in South Jersey. South Philadelphia is home to Vietnamese-Americans in Little Saigon, as well as Cambodian Americans, Thai Americans, and Chinese communities.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Gay village near Washington Square is home to a concentration of gay and lesbian-friendly businesses, restaurants, and bars.[137][138]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Philadelphia\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 68% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christian.[139] Approximately 41% of Christians in the city and area professed attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, while 26% professed Catholic beliefs.\n\n\nThe Protestant Christian community in Philadelphia is dominated by mainline Protestant denominations including the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church in the United States, Presbyterian Church (USA) and American Baptist Churches USA. One of the most prominent mainline Protestant jurisdictions is the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. The African Methodist Episcopal Church was established in Philadelphia. Historically, the city has strong connections to the Quakers, Unitarian Universalism, and the Ethical Culture movement, all of which continue to be represented in the city. The Quaker Friends General Conference is based in Philadelphia. Evangelical Protestants making up less than 15% of the population were also prevalent. Evangelical Protestant bodies included the Anglican Church in North America, Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod, Presbyterian Church in America, and National Baptist Convention of America.\nThe Catholic community is primarily served by the Latin Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia, and the Syro-Malankara Catholic Eparchy of the United States of America and Canada, though some independent Catholic churches exist throughout Philadelphia and its suburbs. The Latin Church-based jurisdiction is headquartered in the city, and its see is the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul. The Ukrainian Catholic jurisdiction is also headquartered in Philadelphia, and is seated at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.\n\n\nLess than 1% of Philadelphia's Christians were Mormons. The remainder of the Christian demographic is spread among smaller Protestant denominations and the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox among others. The Diocese of Eastern Pennsylvania (Orthodox Church in America) and Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America (Ecumenical Patriarchate) divide the Eastern Orthodox in Philadelphia. The Russian Orthodox St. Andrew's Cathedral is in the city.\nThe same study says that other religions collectively compose about 8% of the population, including Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, and Sikhism.[140] Philadelphia has the fifth-largest Muslim population among U.S. cities.[141] The remaining 24% claimed no religious affiliation.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia metropolitan area's Jewish population was estimated at 206,000 in 2001, which was the sixth-largest in the U.S. at that time.[142] Jewish traders were operating in southeastern Pennsylvania long before William Penn. Furthermore, Jews in Philadelphia took a prominent part in the War of Independence. Although the majority of the early Jewish residents were of Portuguese or Spanish descent, some among them had emigrated from Germany and Poland. About the beginning of the 19th century, a number of Jews from the latter countries, finding the services of the Congregation Mickvé Israel unfamiliar to them, resolved to form a new congregation which would use the ritual to which they had been accustomed.\n\n\nAfrican diasporic religions are practiced in some Latino and Hispanic and Caribbean communities in North and West Philadelphia.[143][144]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2010[update], 79.12% (1,112,441) of Philadelphia residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 9.72% (136,688) spoke Spanish, 1.64% (23,075) Chinese, 0.89% (12,499) Vietnamese, 0.77% (10,885) Russian, 0.66% (9,240) French, 0.61% (8,639) other Asian languages, 0.58% (8,217) African languages, 0.56% (7,933) Cambodian (Mon-Khmer), and Italian was spoken as a main language by 0.55% (7,773) of the population over the age of five. In total, 20.88% (293,544) of Philadelphia's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[145]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Philadelphia\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Top publicly traded companiesheadquartered in Philadelphia** |\n| **Corporation** | **2019****rank** | **Revenue****(billions)** |\n| Comcast | 32 | 94.5\n |\n| Aramark | 198 | 15.8\n |\n| FMC | 556 | 4.7\n |\n| Urban Outfitters | 634 | 4.0\n |\n| Carpenter Technology | 940 | 2.2\n |\n| **Source:** *Fortune*[146] |\n\n\nPhiladelphia's close geographical and transportation connections to other large metropolitan economies along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States have been cited as offering a significant competitive advantage for business creation and entrepreneurship.[147] The city is the center of economic activity in both Pennsylvania and the four-state Delaware Valley metropolitan region. Five Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the city. As of 2021[update], the Philadelphia metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of US$479 billion,[148] an increase from the $445 billion calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis for 2017,[149] representing the ninth-largest U.S. metropolitan economy.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's economic sectors include financial services, health care, biotechnology, information technology, trade and transportation, manufacturing, oil refining, food processing, and tourism. Metropolitan Philadelphia is one of the top five American venture capital hubs, credited to its proximity to New York City's financial and tech and biotechnology ecosystems.[22] Financial activities account for the largest economic sector of the metropolitan area, which is also one of the largest health education and research centers in the United States. The city's two largest employers are the federal and city governments.

The city's major art museum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, is one of the largest art museums in the world. The long flight of steps to the Art Museum's main entrance became famous after the film *Rocky* (1976).[176]\n\n\nAreas such as South Street and Old City have a vibrant night life. The Avenue of the Arts in Center City contains many restaurants and theaters, such as the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, home of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Academy of Music, home of Opera Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Ballet.[176] The Wilma Theatre and the Philadelphia Theatre Company at the Suzanne Roberts Theatre produce a variety of new plays.[177][178] Several blocks to the east are the Lantern Theater Company at St. Stephens Episcopal Church;[179] and the Walnut Street Theatre, a National Historic Landmark stated to be the oldest and most subscribed-to theatre in the English-speaking world, founded in 1809.[180] In May 2019, the Walnut Street Theatre announced a major expansion to begin in 2020.[181] New Freedom Theatre, which is Pennsylvania's oldest African-American theatre, sits on North Broad Street.\n\n\nPhiladelphia has more public art than any other American city.[182] In 1872, the Association for Public Art (formerly the Fairmount Park Art Association) was created as the first private association in the United States dedicated to integrating public art and urban planning.[183] In 1959, lobbying by the Artists Equity Association helped create the Percent for Art ordinance, the first for a U.S. city.[184] The program, which has funded more than 200 pieces of public art, is administered by the Philadelphia Office of Arts and Culture, the city's art agency.[185] The city also has more murals than any other American city, due to the 1984 creation of the Department of Recreation's Mural Arts Program, which seeks to beautify neighborhoods and provide an outlet for graffiti artists. The program has funded more than 2,800 murals by professional, staff and volunteer artists and educated more than 20,000 youth in underserved neighborhoods throughout Philadelphia.[186]\n\n\nThe city is home to a number of art organizations including the regional art advocacy nonprofit Philadelphia Tri-State Artists Equity,[187] the Philadelphia Sketch Club, one of the country's oldest artists' clubs,[188] and The Plastic Club, started by women excluded from the Sketch Club.[189] Many Old City art galleries stay open late on the First Friday event of each month.[190] Annual events include the Philadelphia Film Festival, held annually each October, the 6abc Dunkin' Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade, the nation's longest-running continuously held Thanksgiving Day parade, and the Mummers Parade, the nation's longest continuously held folk parade, which is held every New Year's Day.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Philadelphia\n\n![](image)The Curtis Institute of Music at 1726 Locust Street in Center City, one of the world's premier conservatories\nThe Philadelphia Orchestra is generally considered one of the top five orchestras in the United States. The orchestra performs at the Kimmel Center[191] and has a summer concert series at the Mann Center for the Performing Arts.[192] Opera Philadelphia performs at the nation's oldest continually operating opera house—the Academy of Music.[176] The Philadelphia Boys Choir & Chorale has performed its music all over the world.[193] The Philly Pops plays orchestral versions of popular jazz, swing, Broadway, and blues songs at the Kimmel Center and other venues within the mid-Atlantic region.[194] The Curtis Institute of Music is one of the world's premier conservatories and among the most selective institutes of higher education in the nation.[195]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has played a prominent role in the music of the United States. The culture of American popular music has been influenced by significant contributions of Philadelphia area musicians and producers, in both the recording and broadcasting industries. In 1952, the teen dance party program called *Bandstand* premiered on local television, hosted by Bob Horn. The show was renamed *American Bandstand* in 1957, when it began national syndication on ABC, hosted by Dick Clark and produced in Philadelphia until 1964 when it moved to Los Angeles.[196] Promoters marketed youthful musical artists known as teen idols to appeal to the young audience. Philadelphia-born singers such as Frankie Avalon, James Darren, Eddie Fisher, Fabian Forte, and Bobby Rydell, along with South Philly-raised Chubby Checker, topped the music charts, establishing a clean-cut rock and roll image.\n\n\nPhilly soul music of the late 1960s–1970s is a highly produced version of soul music which led to later forms of popular music such as disco and urban contemporary rhythm and blues.[197] On July 13, 1985, John F. Kennedy Stadium was the American venue for the Live Aid concert.[198] The city also hosted the Live 8 concert, which attracted about 700,000 people to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway on July 2, 2005.[199]\n\n\nNotable rock and pop musicians from Philadelphia and its suburbs include Bill Haley & His Comets, Nazz, Todd Rundgren, Hall & Oates, the Hooters, Cinderella, DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, Ween, Schoolly D, Pink, the Roots, Beanie Sigel, State Property, Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes, Meek Mill, Lil Uzi Vert, and others.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuisine of Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Pat's Steaks (foreground) and Geno's Steaks (background) in South Philadelphia\nThe city is known for its hoagies, stromboli, roast pork sandwich, scrapple, soft pretzels, water ice, Irish potato candy, tastykakes, and the cheesesteak sandwich which was developed by Italian immigrants.[200] The Philadelphia area has many establishments that serve cheesesteaks, including restaurants, taverns, delicatessens and pizza parlors.[201][202][203] The originator of the thinly-sliced steak sandwich in the 1930s, initially without cheese, is Pat's King of Steaks, which faces its rival Geno's Steaks, founded in 1966,[204] across the intersection of 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue in the Italian Market of South Philadelphia.[205]\n\n\nMcGillin's Olde Ale House, opened in 1860 on Drury Street in Center City, is the oldest continuously operated tavern in the city.[206] The City Tavern is a replica of a historic 18th-century building first opened in 1773, demolished in 1854 after a fire, and rebuilt in 1975 on the same site as part of Independence National Historical Park.[207] The tavern offers authentic 18th-century recipes, served in seven period dining rooms, three wine cellar rooms and an outdoor garden.[208]\n\n\nThe Reading Terminal Market is a historic food market founded in 1893 in the Reading Terminal building, a designated National Historic Landmark.

Additionally, it shares many similarities with the New York accent. Owing to over a century of linguistic data collected by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania under sociolinguist William Labov, the Philadelphia dialect has been one of the best-studied forms of American English.[211][212][f] The accent is especially found within the Irish American and Italian American working-class neighborhoods.[213] Philadelphia also has its own unique collection of neologisms and slang terms.[214]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Philadelphia 76ers, Philadelphia Flyers, Philadelphia Eagles, Philadelphia Phillies, and Philadelphia Union\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nCitizens Bank Park, home of the Phillies since 2004, and Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Eagles since 2003\n\n![](image)The Philadelphia Eagles are presented with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018\n![](image)Wells Fargo Center in South Philadelphia, home of the two-time Stanley Cup champion Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL) and three-time champion Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA)\n![](image)Historic Boathouse Row at night on the Schuylkill River, a symbol of the city's rich rowing history\nPhiladelphia's first professional sports team was baseball's Athletics, organized in 1860.[215] The Athletics were initially an amateur league team that turned professional in 1871, and then became a founding team of the current National League in 1876.[216] The city is one of 13 U.S. cities to have teams in all four major league sports: the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB), the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL), the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL), and the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).[217] The Phillies, formed in 1883 as the Quakers and renamed in 1884,[218] are the oldest team continuously playing under the same name in the same city in the history of American professional sports.[219]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia metro area is also home to the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer (MLS). The Union began playing their home games in 2010 at PPL Park, a soccer-specific stadium in Chester, Pennsylvania.[220] The stadium's name was changed to Talen Energy Stadium in 2016[221] and to Subaru Park in 2020.[222]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was the second of eight American cities to have won titles in all four major leagues (MLB, NFL, NHL and NBA), and also has a title in soccer from the now-defunct North American Soccer League in the 1970s. The city's professional teams and their fans endured 25 years without a championship, from the 76ers 1983 NBA Finals win[223] until the Phillies 2008 World Series win.[224][225] The lack of championships was sometimes attributed in jest to the Curse of Billy Penn after One Liberty Place became the first building to surpass the height of the William Penn statue on top of City Hall's tower in 1987.[226] After nine years passed without another championship, the Eagles won their first Super Bowl following the 2017 season.[227] In 2004, ESPN placed Philadelphia second on its list of The Fifteen Most Tortured Sports Cities.[228][229] Fans of the Eagles and Phillies were singled out as the worst fans in the country by *GQ* magazine in 2011, which used the subtitle of \"Meanest Fans in America\" to summarize incidents of drunken behavior and a history of booing.[230][231]\n\n\nMajor professional sports teams that originated in Philadelphia but later moved to other cities include the Golden State Warriors basketball team, which played in Philadelphia from 1946 to 1962[232] and the Oakland Athletics baseball team, which was originally the Philadelphia Athletics and played in Philadelphia from 1901 to 1954.[233]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is home to professional, semi-professional, and elite amateur teams in cricket, rugby league (Philadelphia Fight), and rugby union. Major running events in the city include the Penn Relays (track and field), the Philadelphia Marathon, and the Broad Street Run. The Collegiate Rugby Championship is played every June at Talen Energy Stadium in Chester.[234]\n\n\nRowing has been popular in Philadelphia since the 18th century.[235] Boathouse Row is a symbol of Philadelphia's rich rowing history, and each Big Five member has its own boathouse.[236] Philadelphia hosts numerous local and collegiate rowing clubs and competitions, including the annual Dad Vail Regatta, which is the largest intercollegiate rowing event in North America with more than 100 U.S. and Canadian colleges and universities participating;[237] the annual Stotesbury Cup Regatta, which is billed as the world's oldest and largest rowing event for high school students;[238][239] and the Head of the Schuylkill Regatta.[240] The regattas are held on the Schuylkill River and organized by the Schuylkill Navy, an association of area rowing clubs that has produced numerous Olympic rowers.[241]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Spinners were a professional ultimate team in Major League Ultimate (MLU) until 2016. The Spinners were one of the original eight teams of the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) that began in 2012. They played at Franklin Field and won the inaugural AUDL championship and the final MLU championship in 2016.[242] The MLU was suspended indefinitely by its investors in December 2016.[243] As of 2018[update], the Philadelphia Phoenix continue to play in the AUDL.[244]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is home to the Philadelphia Big 5, a group of five NCAA Division I college basketball programs. The Big 5 include La Salle, Penn, Saint Joseph's, Temple, and Villanova universities.[245] The sixth NCAA Division I school in Philadelphia is Drexel University. Villanova won the 1985,[246] 2016,[247] and 2018[248] championship of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.

All county functions were assumed by the city in 1952.[252] The city has been coterminous with the county since 1854.[63]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's 1952 Home Rule Charter was written by the City Charter Commission, which was created by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in an act of April 21, 1949, and a city ordinance of June 15, 1949. The existing city council received a proposed draft on February 14, 1951, and the electors approved it in an election held April 17, 1951.[253] The first elections under the new Home Rule Charter were held in November 1951, and the newly elected officials took office in January 1952.[252]\n\n\nThe city uses the strong-mayor version of the mayor–council form of government, which is led by one mayor in whom executive authority is vested. The mayor has the authority to appoint and dismiss members of all boards and commissions without the approval of the city council. Elected at-large, the mayor is limited to two consecutive four-year terms, but can run for the position again after an intervening term.[253]\n\n\n\n### Courts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: District Attorney of Philadelphia, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia County is coterminous with the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania. The Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas is the trial court of general jurisdiction for the city, hearing felony-level criminal cases and civil suits above the minimum jurisdictional limit of $10,000. The court also has appellate jurisdiction over rulings from the Municipal and Traffic Courts, and some administrative agencies and boards. The trial division has 70 commissioned judges elected by the voters, along with about one thousand other employees.[254] The court also has a family division with 25 judges[255] and an orphans' court with three judges.[256]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the city's District Attorney is Larry Krasner, a Democrat.[257] The last Republican to hold the office is Ronald D. Castille, who left in 1991 and later served as the Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court from 2008 to 2014.[258]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Municipal Court handles traffic cases, misdemeanor and felony criminal cases with maximum incarceration of five years, and civil cases involving $12,000 or less ($15,000 in real estate and school tax cases), and all landlord-tenant disputes. The municipal court has 27 judges elected by the voters.[259]\n\n\nPennsylvania's three appellate courts also have sittings in Philadelphia. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the court of last resort in the state, regularly hears arguments in Philadelphia City Hall.[260] The Superior Court of Pennsylvania and the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania also sit in Philadelphia several times a year.[261][262] Judges for these courts are elected at large.[263] The state Supreme Court and Superior Court have deputy prothonotary offices in Philadelphia.[264][265]\n\n\nAdditionally, Philadelphia is home to the federal United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, both of which are housed in the James A.

Roosevelt in his landslide victory of 1932 as Pennsylvania was one of only six states won by Republican Herbert Hoover. Voter turnout surged from 600,000 in 1932 to nearly 900,000 in 1936 and Roosevelt carried Philadelphia with over 60% of the vote. The city has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1936. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama drew 83% of the city's vote. Obama's win was even greater in 2012, capturing 85% of the vote. In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton won 82% of the vote.[273]\n\n\nAs a result of the previously declining population in the city and state,[277] Philadelphia has only three congressional districts of the 18 districts in Pennsylvania, based on the 2010 census apportionment:[278] the 2nd district, represented by Brendan Boyle; the 3rd, represented by Dwight Evans; and the 5th, represented by Mary Gay Scanlon.[279] All three representatives are Democrats though Republicans still have some support in the city, primarily in the Northeast.[280] Sam Katz ran competitive mayoral races as the Republican nominee in 1999 and 2003, losing to Democrat John Street both times.[281][282]\n\n\nPennsylvania's longest-serving Senator, Arlen Specter,[283] was an alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania who opened his first law practice in Philadelphia.[284] Specter served as a Republican from 1981 and as a Democrat from 2009, losing that party's primary in 2010 and leaving office in January 2011.[285] He had also been assistant counsel on the Warren Commission in 1964 and the city's district attorney from 1966 to 1974.[284]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has hosted various national conventions, including in 1848 (Whig), 1856 (Republican), 1872 (Republican), 1900 (Republican), 1936 (Democratic), 1940 (Republican), 1948 (Republican), 1948 (Progressive), 2000 (Republican), and 2016 (Democratic).[286] Philadelphia has been home to one vice president, George M. Dallas,[287] and one general of the American Civil War, George B. McClellan, who won his party's nomination for president but lost in the general election to Abraham Lincoln in 1864.[288] In May 2019, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden chose Philadelphia to be his 2020 U.S. presidential campaign headquarters.[289]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\n\"Green Cities, Clean Water\" is an environmental policy initiative based in Philadelphia that has shown promising results in mitigating the effects of climate change.[290] The researchers on the policy have stated that despite such promising plans of green infrastructure building, \"the city is forecasted to grow warmer, wetter, and more urbanized over the century, runoff and local temperatures will increase on average throughout the city\".[290] Even though landcover predictive models on the effects of the policy initiative have indicated that green infrastructure could be useful at decreasing the amount of runoff in the city over time, the city government would have to expand its current plans and \"consider the cobenefit of climate change adaptation when planning new projects'' in limiting the scope of city-wide temperature increase.[290]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Crime in Philadelphia and Philadelphia crime family\n\n#### Police and law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Police Department\n\n![](image)The Philadelphia Police Department administration building, known as the Roundhouse, in Center City east of Chinatown\n![](image)A Philadelphia police cruiser on Benjamin Franklin Parkway\nAccording to a 2015 report by Pew Charitable Trusts, the police districts with the highest rates of violent crime were Frankford (15th district) and Kensington (24th district) in the Near Northeast, and districts to the North (22nd, 25th, and 35th districts), West (19th district) and Southwest (12th district) of Center City. Each of those seven districts recorded more than a thousand violent crimes in 2014. The lowest rates of violent crime occurred in Center City, South Philadelphia, the Far Northeast, and Roxborough districts, the latter of which includes Manayunk.[150]\n\n\nPhiladelphia had 500 (503 according to some sources) murders in 1990, a rate of 31.5 per 100,000. An average of about 400 murders occurred each year for most of the 1990s. The murder count dropped in 2002 to 288, then rose to 406 by 2006, before dropping slightly to 392 in 2007.[291][292] A few years later, Philadelphia began to see a rapid decline in homicides and violent crime. In 2013, the city had 246 murders, which is a decrease of nearly 40% since 2006.[293] In 2014, 248 homicides were committed. The homicide rate rose to 280 in 2015, then fell slightly to 277 in 2016, before rising again to 317 in 2017.[294] Homicides increased dramatically in the late 2010s/early 2020s, reaching 499 homicides in 2020[291] and surpassing the 1990 \"record\" in 2021, with 501st murder on November 27 and 510 by the end of the month.[295]\n\n\nIn 2006, Philadelphia's homicide rate of 27.7 per 100,000 people was the highest of the country's 10 most populous cities.[296] In 2012, Philadelphia had the fourth-highest homicide rate among the country's most populous cities. The rate dropped to 16 homicides per 100,000 residents by 2014 placing Philadelphia as the sixth-highest city in the country.[150]\n\n\nThe number of shootings in the city has declined significantly since the early years of the 21st century. Shooting incidents peaked at 1,857 in 2006 before declining nearly 44 percent to 1,047 shootings in 2014.[150] Major crimes have decreased gradually since a peak in 2006 when 85,498 major crimes were reported. The number of reported major crimes fell 11 percent in three years to 68,815 occurrences in 2014. Violent crimes, which include homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery, decreased 14 percent in three years to 15,771 occurrences in 2014.[150]\n\n\nIn 2014, Philadelphia enacted an ordinance decriminalizing the possession of less than 30 grams of marijuana or 8 grams of hashish; the ordinance gave police officers the discretion to treat possession of these amounts as a civil infraction punishable by a $25 ticket, rather than a crime.[297][298] Philadelphia was at the time the largest city to decriminalize the possession of marijuana.[298] From 2013 to 2018, marijuana arrests in the city dropped by more than 85%.[297] The purchase or sale of marijuana remains a criminal offense in Philadelphia.[298]\n\n\n\n#### Firefighting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Fire Department\n\nThe Philadelphia Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency medical services (EMS). The department's official mission is to protect public safety by quick and professional response to emergencies and the promotion of sound emergency prevention measures. This mandate encompasses all traditional firefighting functions, including fire suppression, with 60 engine companies and 30 ladder companies[299] as well as specialty and support units deployed throughout the city; specialized firefighting units for Philadelphia International Airport and the Port of Philadelphia; investigations conducted by the fire marshal's office to determine the origins of fires and develop preventive strategies; prevention programs to educate the public; and support services including research and planning, management of the fire communications center within the city's 911 system, and operation of the Philadelphia Fire Academy.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Media in Philadelphia\n\n### Newspapers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Inquirer Building at 400 North Broad Street was home of *The Philadelphia Inquirer*, the nation's third-longest continuously published newspaper, until 2012 when it moved its headquarters to Market Street. The building is currently undergoing renovations to become the new headquarters of the Philadelphia Police Department.\nPhiladelphia's two major daily newspapers are *The Philadelphia Inquirer*, first published in 1829—the third-oldest surviving daily newspaper in the country—and the *Philadelphia Daily News*, first published in 1925.[300] The *Daily News* has been published as an edition of the *Inquirer* since 2009.[301] Recent owners of the *Inquirer* and *Daily News* have included Knight Ridder, The McClatchy Company, and Philadelphia Media Holdings, with the latter organization declaring bankruptcy in 2010.[302] After two years of financial struggle, the newspapers were sold to Interstate General Media in 2012.[302] The two newspapers had a combined daily circulation of 306,831 and a Sunday circulation of 477,313 in 2013[update], the 18th-largest circulation in the country, and the website of the newspapers, Philly.com,[303] was ranked 13th in popularity among online U.S. newspapers by Alexa Internet that same year.[304]\n\n\nSmaller publications include the *Philadelphia Tribune* published five days each week for the African-American community;[305] *Philadelphia* magazine, a monthly regional magazine;[306] *Philadelphia Weekly*, a weekly alternative newspaper;[307] *Philadelphia Gay News*, a weekly newspaper for the LGBT community;[308] *The Jewish Exponent*, a weekly newspaper for the Jewish community;[309] *Al Día*, a weekly newspaper for the Latino community;[310] and *Philadelphia Metro*, a free daily newspaper.[311]\n\n\nStudent-run newspapers include the University of Pennsylvania's *The Daily Pennsylvanian*,[312] Temple University's *The Temple News*,[313] and Drexel University's *The Triangle*.[314]\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nThe first experimental radio license was issued in Philadelphia in August 1912 to St. Joseph's College. The first commercial AM radio stations began broadcasting in 1922: first WIP, then owned by Gimbels department store, followed by WFIL, then owned by Strawbridge & Clothier department store, and WOO, a defunct station owned by Wanamaker's department store, as well as WCAU and WDAS.[315]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the FCC lists 28 FM and 11 AM stations for Philadelphia.[316][317] As of December 2017, the ten highest-rated stations in Philadelphia were adult contemporary WBEB-FM (101.1), sports talk WIP-FM (94.1), classic rock WMGK-FM (102.9), urban adult contemporary WDAS-FM (105.3), classic hits WOGL-FM (98.1), album-oriented rock WMMR-FM (93.3), country music WXTU-FM (92.5), all-news KYW-AM (1060), talk radio WHYY-FM (90.9), and urban adult contemporary WRNB-FM (100.3).[318][319] Philadelphia is served by three non-commercial public radio stations: WHYY-FM (NPR),[320] WRTI-FM (classical and jazz),[321] and WXPN-FM (adult alternative music).[322]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRadio stations in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, metropolitan area\n |\n| --- |\n| By AM frequency | * 560\n* 610\n* 640\n* 690\n* 740\n* 800\n* 860\n* 900\n* 950\n* 990\n* 10601\n* 1180\n* 12101\n* 1310\n* 1340\n* 1370\n* 1420\n* 1440\n* 1460\n* 1480\n* 1490\n* 1520\n* 1540\n* 1570\n* 1590\n* 1640\n* 1680\n |\n| By FM frequency | * 88.1\n\t+ WPEB\n\t+ WTHA\n\t+ WZZD\n* 88.3\n* 88.5\n* 88.7\n* 88.9\n\t+ WBYO\n\t+ WBZC\n* 89.1\n* 89.3\n\t+ WRDV\n\t+ WRTJ\n* 89.5\n* 89.7\n* 90.1\n* 90.9\n* 91.5\n\t+ WDBK\n\t+ WSRN-FM\n* 91.7\n\t+ WBMR\n\t+ WCUR\n\t+ WKDU\n\t+ WLBS\n* 92.5\n* 93.3\n* 93.7\n* 94.1\n* 94.5\n* 94.9\n* 95.7\n* 96.5\n* 97.5\n* 98.1\n* 98.9\n* 99.5\n* 99.9\n* 100.3\n* 101.1\n* 101.5\n* 102.1\n* 102.9\n* 103.9\n* 104.5\n* 105.3\n* 106.1\n* 106.9\n* 107.9\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| LPFM | * 92.9\n\t+ WGGT-LP\n\t+ WOOM-LP\n\t+ WRGU-LP\n\t+ WRLG-LP\n\t+ WZML-LP\n* 98.5\n\t+ WJYN-LP\n\t+ WNUW-LP\n\t+ WQEW-LP\n* 106.5\n |\n| Translators | * 92.9\n* 94.9\n* 95.1\n* 95.3\n* 96.1\n* 97.1\n\t+ W246AR\n\t+ W246AQ\n* 98.5\n* 99.9\n* 100.7\n* 102.5\n* 103.3\n* 103.5\n* 103.9\n* 104.1\n* 105.7\n\t+ W289AZ\n\t+ W289CZ\n* 107.3\n |\n\n |\n| NOAA Weather Radiofrequency | * 162.425\n* 162.475\n |\n| Digital radioby frequency & subchannel | * 1210\n* 88.5-1\n* 88.5-2\n* 89.3-1\n* 89.3-2\n* 89.5-1\n* 89.5-2\n* 90.1-1\n* 90.1-2\n* 90.9-1\n* 92.5-1\n* 92.5-2\n* 93.3-1\n* 93.3-2\n* 93.7-1\n* 93.7-2\n* 93.7-3\n* 94.1-1\n* 94.1-2\n* 94.1-3\n* 95.7-1\n* 95.7-2\n* 96.5-1\n* 96.5-2\n* 97.5-1\n* 97.5-2\n* 97.5-3\n* 98.1-1\n* 98.1-2\n* 98.1-3\n* 98.9-1\n* 99.5-1\n* 100.3-1\n* 100.3-2\n* 100.3-3\n* 101.1-1\n* 101.1-2\n* 101.5-1\n* 101.5-2\n* 102.1-1\n* 102.1-2\n* 102.1-3\n* 102.9-1\n* 102.9-2\n* 102.9-3\n* 104.5-1\n* 104.5-2\n* 105.3-1\n* 105.3-2\n* 106.1-1\n* 106.1-2\n* 106.9-1\n* 106.9-2\n* 106.9-3\n* 107.9-1\n* 107.9-2\n |\n| By call sign | * KIH28\n* KYW1\n* W225DJ\n* W235CE\n* W236CL\n* W237EH\n* W241CH\n* W246AR\n* W246AQ\n* W253CA\n* W260CZ\n* W264BH\n* W273DO\n* W277DL\n* W278AK\n* W280CP\n* W281CL\n* W289AZ\n* W289CZ\n* W297AD\n* WBCB\n* WBEB\n\t+ HD2\n* WBEN-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WBMR\n* WBYO\n* WBZC\n* WCHE\n* WCHR\n* WCOJ\n* WCUR\n* WDAS\n* WDAS-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WDBK\n* WEMG\n* WFIL\n* WFYL\n* WGGT-LP\n* WGLS-FM\n* WHAT\n* WHHS\n* WHYY\n* WIFI\n* WIOQ\n* WIP-FM\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WISP\n* WJFP\n* WJYN-LP\n* WKDN\n* WKDU\n* WKVP\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WKXW\n\t+ HD2\n* WLBS\n* WMGK\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WMMR\n\t+ HD2\n* WNG704\n* WNPV\n* WNTP\n* WNUW-LP\n* WNWR\n* WOGL\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WOOM-LP\n* WPAZ\n* WPEB\n* WPEN\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WPHE\n* WPHI-FM\n* WPHT1\n* WPNX700\n* WPPM-LP\n* WPPZ-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WPST\n* WPWA\n* WQEW-LP\n* WQHS\n* WRDV\n* WRFF\n\t+ HD2\n* WRGU-LP\n* WRLG-LP\n* WRNB\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WRSD\n* WRTI\n\t+ HD2\n* WRTJ\n\t+ HD2\n* WSRN-FM\n* WSTW\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WTDY-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WTEL\n* WTHA\n* WTMR\n* WTTM\n* WUMR\n\t+ HD2\n* WURD\n* WUSL\n* WVCW\n* WWDB\n* WWJZ\n* WWLU\n* WXPN\n\t+ HD2\n* WXTU\n\t+ HD2\n* WXVU\n* WYPA\n\t+ HD2\n* WZML-LP\n* WZXE\n* WZZD\n |\n| Internet | * WEXP\n* WQHS\n* WYBF\n |\n| Defunct | * WDNR (89.5 FM)\n* WEXP (1600 AM)\n* WJJZ (1460 AM)\n* WNAP (1110 AM)\n* WNJC (1360 AM)\n* WOO\n* WQHS\n* WYBF (89.1 FM)\n* WZZE (97.3 FM)\n |\n| Radio stations in the Delaware Valley\nPhiladelphia\nVineland-Millville-Bridgeton\nWilmington\n\nOther nearby regions\nAllentown-Bethlehem\nAtlantic City-Cape May\nDover\nLancaster\nReading\nTrenton\nSee also\nList of radio stations in Pennsylvania\n* Mass media in the Philadelphia Area\n\t+ Radio stations\n\t+ TV stations\n\t+ Newspapers\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nNotes\n1.

The station became NBC's first affiliate in 1939, and later became KYW-TV (currently a CBS affiliate). WCAU-TV, WFIL-TV, and WHYY-TV were all founded by the 1960s.[315] In 1952, WFIL (renamed WPVI) premiered the television show *Bandstand*, which later became the nationally broadcast *American Bandstand* hosted by Dick Clark.[323]\n\n\nEach commercial network has an affiliate in Philadelphia: KYW-TV 3 (CBS), WPVI-TV 6 (ABC), WCAU 10 (NBC), WPHL-TV 17 (The CW with MyNetworkTV on DT2), WFPA-CD 28 (UniMás), WTXF-TV 29 (Fox), WPSG 57 (Independent), WWSI 62 (Telemundo), and WUVP-DT 65 (Univision). The region is served also by public broadcasting stations WPPT-TV (Philadelphia), WHYY-TV (Wilmington, Delaware and Philadelphia), WLVT-TV (Lehigh Valley), and NJTV (New Jersey).[324]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has owned-and-operated stations for five major English-language broadcast networks: NBC – WCAU-TV, CBS – KYW-TV, ABC – WPVI-TV, Fox – WTXF-TV and The CW – WPHL-TV. The major Spanish-language networks are Univision – WUVP-DT, UniMás – WFPA-CD, and Telemundo – WWSI-TV.[324]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the city is the nation's fourth-largest consumer in media market, as ranked by the Nielsen Media Research firm, with nearly 2.9 million TV households.[325]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBroadcast television in the Delaware Valley region\n |\n| --- |\n| This region

Philadelphia\n\nSince at least the 1700s, hundreds of books and articles have been written about Philadelphia's history, culture, sports teams, crime, politics, and other themes related to the city's past, present, and future.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Philadelphia\n\nSee also: 30th Street Station, List of Philadelphia subway stations, and Philadelphia International Airport\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's 30th Street Station serves both SEPTA regional and Amtrak national trains and is Amtrak's third-busiest train station in the nation.\n![](image)A Market–Frankford Line train departing 52nd Street station\nPhiladelphia is served by SEPTA, which operates buses, trains, rapid transit (as both subways and elevated trains), trolleys, and trackless trolleys (electric buses) throughout Philadelphia, the four Pennsylvania suburban counties of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery, in addition to service to Mercer County, New Jersey (Trenton) and New Castle County, Delaware (Wilmington and Newark, Delaware).[326] The city's subway system consists of two routes: the subway section of the Market–Frankford Line running east–west under Market Street which opened in 1905 to the west and 1908 to the east of City Hall,[327] and the Broad Street Line running north–south beneath Broad Street which opened in stages from 1928 to 1938.[328]\n\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, large sections of the SEPTA Regional Rail service to the far suburbs of Philadelphia were discontinued due to a lack of funding for equipment and infrastructure maintenance.[329][330][331]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's 30th Street Station is a major railroad station on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor with 4.4 million passengers in 2017 making it the third-busiest station in the country after New York City's Pennsylvania Station and Washington's Union Station.[332] 30th Street Station offers access to Amtrak,[333] SEPTA,[334] and NJ Transit lines.[335] Over 12 million SEPTA and NJ Transit rail commuters use the station each year, and more than 100,000 people on an average weekday.[332]\n\n\nThe PATCO Speedline provides rapid transit service to Camden, Collingswood, Westmont, Haddonfield, Woodcrest (Cherry Hill), Ashland (Voorhees), and Lindenwold, New Jersey, from stations on Locust Street between 16th and 15th, 13th and 12th, and 10th and 9th Streets, and on Market Street at 8th Street.[336]\n\n\n\n#### Airports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Philadelphia International Airport\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Philadelphia International Airport, the busiest airport in Pennsylvania and 21st-busiest in the nation\nTwo airports serve Philadelphia: the Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) is 7 mi (11 km) south-southwest of Center City on the boundary with Delaware County, providing scheduled domestic and international air service,[337] while Northeast Philadelphia Airport (PNE) is a general aviation relief airport in Northeast Philadelphia serving general and corporate aviation.[338] Philadelphia International Airport is among the busiest airports in the world measured by traffic movements (i.e., takeoffs and landings).[339] More than 30 million passengers pass through the airport annually on 25 airlines, including all major domestic carriers. The airport has nearly 500 daily departures to more than 120 destinations worldwide.[337] SEPTA's Airport Regional Rail Line provides direct service between Center City railroad stations and Philadelphia International Airport.[340]\n\n\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 9,650 feet (2,940 m) long Benjamin Franklin Bridge spans the Delaware River, connecting Philadelphia and South Jersey\n![](image)The Schuylkill Expressway eastbound at I-676 and US 30, also known as the Vine Street Expressway, in Center City\nWilliam Penn planned Philadelphia with numbered streets traversing north and south, and streets named for trees, such as Chestnut, Walnut, and Mulberry (since renamed Arch Street), traversing east and west. The two main streets were named Broad Street (the north–south artery, since designated Pennsylvania Route 611) and High Street (the east–west artery, since renamed Market Street) converging at Centre Square which later became the site of City Hall.[341]\n\n\nInterstate 95 (the Delaware Expressway) traverses the southern and eastern edges of the city along the Delaware River as the main north–south controlled-access highway, connecting Philadelphia with Newark, New Jersey and New York City to the north and with Baltimore and Washington, D.C. southward. The city is also served by Interstate 76 (the Schuylkill Expressway), which runs along the Schuylkill River, intersecting the Pennsylvania Turnpike at King of Prussia and providing access to Harrisburg and points west. Interstate 676 (the Vine Street Expressway) links I-95 and I-76 through Center City by running below street level between the eastbound and westbound lanes of Vine Street. Entrance and exit ramps for the Benjamin Franklin Bridge are near the eastern end of the expressway, just west of the I-95 interchange.[342]\n\n\nThe Roosevelt Boulevard and Expressway (U.S. 1) connect Northeast Philadelphia with Center City via I-76 through Fairmount Park. Woodhaven Road (Route 63) and Cottman Avenue (Route 73) serve the neighborhoods of Northeast Philadelphia, running between I-95 and the Roosevelt Boulevard. The Fort Washington Expressway (Route 309) extends north from the city's northern border, serving Montgomery County and Bucks County. U.S. Route 30 (Lancaster Avenue) extends westward from West Philadelphia to Lancaster.[342]\n\n\nInterstate 476 (locally referred to as the Blue Route[343]) traverses Delaware County, bypassing the city to the west and serving the city's western suburbs, and provides a direct route to Allentown and points north, including the Poconos. Interstate 276, the Pennsylvania Turnpike's Delaware River extension, is a bypass and commuter route to the north of the city and a link to the New Jersey Turnpike and New York City.[342]\n\n\nThe Delaware River Port Authority operates four bridges in the Philadelphia area across the Delaware River to New Jersey: the Walt Whitman Bridge (I-76), the Benjamin Franklin Bridge (I-676 and U.S. 30), the Betsy Ross Bridge (New Jersey Route 90), and the Commodore Barry Bridge (U.S. 322 in Delaware County, south of the city).[344] The Burlington County Bridge Commission maintains two bridges across the Delaware River: the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge which connects PA Route 73 in the Tacony section of Northeast Philadelphia with New Jersey Route 73 in Palmyra, Burlington County, and the Burlington–Bristol Bridge which connects NJ Route 413/U.S. Route 130 in Burlington, New Jersey with PA Route 413/U.S. 13 in Bristol Township, north of Philadelphia.[345]\n\n\n\n#### Bus service[edit]\n\n\nThe Greyhound terminal is at 1001 Filbert Street (at 10th Street) in Center City, southeast of the Pennsylvania Convention Center and south of Chinatown.[346] Several other bus operators provide service at the Greyhound terminal including Fullington Trailways,[347] Martz Trailways,[348] Peter Pan Bus Lines,[349] and NJ Transit buses.[350]\n\n\nOther intercity bus services include Megabus with stops at 30th Street Station and the visitor center for Independence Hall,[351] BoltBus (operated by Greyhound) at 30th Street Station,[352] OurBus at various stops in the city.\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of rail transport in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Suburban Station with art deco architecture at 16th Street and JFK Boulevard\nSince the early days of rail transportation in the United States, Philadelphia has served as a hub for several major rail companies, particularly the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Railroad. The Pennsylvania Railroad first operated Broad Street Station, then 30th Street Station and Suburban Station, and the Reading Railroad operated Reading Terminal, now part of the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The two companies also operated competing commuter rail systems in the area. The two systems now operate as a single system under the control of SEPTA, the regional transit authority. Additionally, the PATCO Speedline subway system and NJ Transit's Atlantic City Line operate successor services to southern New Jersey.[353]\n\n\nIn 1911, Philadelphia had nearly 4,000 electric trolleys running on 86 lines.[354] In 2005, SEPTA reintroduced trolley service to the Girard Avenue Line, Route 15.[355] SEPTA operates six subway-surface trolleys that run on street-level tracks in West Philadelphia and subway tunnels in Center City, along with two surface trolleys in adjacent suburbs.[356]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a regional hub of the federally-owned Amtrak system, with 30th Street Station being a primary stop on the Washington-Boston Northeast Corridor and the Keystone Corridor to Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. 30th Street also serves as a major station for services via the Pennsylvania Railroad's former Pennsylvania Main Line to Chicago. As of 2018[update], 30th Street is Amtrak's third-busiest station in the country, after New York City and Washington.[159]\n\n\n\n#### Walk Score ranks[edit]\n\n\nA 2017 study by Walk Score ranked Philadelphia the fifth-most walkable major city in the United States with a score of 79 out of 100, in the middle of the \"very walkable\" range. The city was just edged out by fourth place Miami (79.2), with the top three cities being New York, San Francisco, and Boston. Philadelphia placed fifth in the public transit friendly category, behind Washington, D.C., with the same three cities for walkability topping this category. The city ranked tenth in the bike friendly cities category, with the top three cities being Minneapolis, San Francisco and Portland.[357]\n\n\n*USA Today* readers voted the Schuylkill River Trail the best urban trail in the nation in 2015.[358]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\n#### Water purity and availability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fairmount Water Works, Philadelphia's second municipal waterworks, in December 1984\nIn 1815, Philadelphia began sourcing its water via the Fairmount Water Works on the Schuylkill River, the nation's first major urban water supply system. In 1909, the Water Works was decommissioned as the city transitioned to modern sand filtration methods.[359] Today, the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) provides drinking water, wastewater collection, and stormwater services for Philadelphia, as well as surrounding counties. PWD draws about 57 percent of its drinking water from the Delaware River and the balance from the Schuylkill River.[360] The city has two filtration plants on the Schuylkill River and one on the Delaware River. The three plants can treat up to 546 million gallons of water per day, while the total storage capacity of the combined plant and distribution system exceeds one billion gallons. The wastewater system consists of three water pollution control plants, 21 pumping stations, and about 3,657 miles (5,885 km) of sewers.[360]\n\n\n\n#### Electricity[edit]\n\n\nExelon subsidiary PECO Energy Company, founded as the Brush Electric Light Company of Philadelphia in 1881 and renamed Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) in 1902, provides electricity to about 1.6 million customers and more than 500,000 natural gas customers in the southeastern Pennsylvania area including the city of Philadelphia and most of its suburbs.[361] PECO is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state with 472 power substations and nearly 23,000 miles (37,000 km) of electric transmission and distribution lines, along with 12,000 miles (19,000 km) of natural gas transmission, distribution & service lines.[362]\n\n\n\n#### Natural gas[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Philadelphia Gas Works\n\nPhiladelphia Gas Works (PGW), overseen by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, is the nation's largest municipally-owned natural gas utility. PGW serves over 500,000 homes and businesses in the Philadelphia area.[363] Founded in 1836, the company came under city ownership in 1987 and has been providing the majority of gas distributed within city limits. In 2014, the City Council refused to conduct hearings on a $1.86 billion sale of PGW, part of a two-year effort that was proposed by the mayor. The refusal led to the prospective buyer terminating its offer.[364][365]\n\n\n\n#### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Area codes 215, 267, and 445\n\nSoutheastern Pennsylvania was assigned the 215 area code in 1947 when the North American Numbering Plan of the Bell System went into effect. The geographic area covered by the code was split nearly in half in 1994 when area code 610 was created, with the city and its northern suburbs retaining 215. Overlay area code 267 was added to the 215 service area in 1997, and 484 was added to the 610 area in 1999. A plan in 2001 to introduce a third overlay code to both service areas, area code 445 to 215 and area code 835 to 610, was delayed and later rescinded.[366] Area code 445 was implemented as an overlay for area codes 215 and 267 starting on February 3, 2018.[367]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Philadelphia\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Chinatown paifang at 10th and Arch Streets, a symbol of Philadelphia's sister city relationship with Tianjin\n\n\n| City\n | Country\n | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Florence[368] | Italy\n | 1964\n |\n| Tel Aviv[369] | Israel\n | 1966\n |\n| Toruń[370] | Poland\n | 1976\n |\n| Tianjin[371] | China\n | 1979\n |\n| Incheon[372] | South Korea\n | 1984\n |\n| Douala[373] | Cameroon\n | 1986\n |\n| Nizhny Novgorod[374] | Russia\n | 1992\n |\n| Frankfurt[375] | Germany\n | 2015\n |\n\n\nPhiladelphia also has three partnership cities or regions:[376]\n\n\n\n\n\n| City\n | Country\n | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Kobe[377] | Japan\n | 1986\n |\n| Abruzzo[378] | Italy\n | 1997\n |\n| Aix-en-Provence[379] | France\n | 1999\n |\n\n\nPhiladelphia has eight official sister cities as designated by the Citizen Diplomacy International of Philadelphia:[376] Philadelphia has dedicated landmarks to its sister cities. The Sister Cities Park, a site of 0.5 acres (2,400 sq yd) at 18th and Benjamin Franklin Parkway within Logan Square, was dedicated in June 1976. The park was built to commemorate Philadelphia's first two sister city relationships, with Tel Aviv and Florence. The Toruń Triangle, honoring the sister city relationship with Toruń, Poland, was constructed in 1976, west of the United Way building at 18th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Sister Cities Park was redesigned and reopened in 2012, featuring an interactive fountain honoring Philadelphia's sister and partnership cities, a café and visitor's center, children's play area, outdoor garden, and boat pond, as well as a pavilion built to environmentally friendly standards.[380][381]\n\n\nThe Chinatown Gate, erected in 1984 and crafted by artisans of Tianjin, stands astride 10th Street, on the north side of its intersection with Arch Street, as a symbol of the sister city relationship. The CDI of Philadelphia has participated in the U.S. Department of State's \"Partners for Peace\" project with Mosul, Iraq,[382] as well as accepting visiting delegations from dozens of other countries.[383]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n* ![](image)Philadelphia portal\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* List of Pennsylvania state historical markers in Philadelphia County\n* Metropolitan areas in the Americas\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Philadelphia\n* USS *Philadelphia*, 6 ships\n* Alaşehir, ancient Philadelphia in Turkey\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Description of the Lenape peoples (Delaware nations) historic territories inside the divides of the frequently mountainous landforms flanking the Delaware River's drainage basin.

The February 2010 storms contributed to a single month record accumulation of 51.5 in (131 cm). If no snow fell outside of February that season, 2009–10 would still rank as 5th-snowiest. See the Franklin Institute for a visual representation of seasonal snowfall.\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n4. **^** Official temperature and precipitation measurements for Philadelphia were taken at the Weather Bureau Office in downtown from January 1872 to 19 June 1940, and at Philadelphia Int'l from 20 June 1940 to the present.[111] Snowfall and snow depth records date to 1 January 1884 and 1 October 1948, respectively.[105] In 2006, snowfall measurements were moved to National Park, New Jersey directly across the Delaware River from the airport.[112]\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** From 15% sample\n6. **^** E.g., in the opening chapter of *The Handbook of Language Variation and Change* (ed.

It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S. with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area of Western Pennsylvania; its population of 2.457 million is the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Furthermore, it is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area that extends into Ohio and West Virginia.\n\n\nPittsburgh is located in southwest Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[5] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[6] Pittsburgh is known both as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry, and as the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[7] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[8] Deindustrialization in the 1970s and 1980s laid off area blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, and thousands of downtown white-collar workers also lost jobs when several Pittsburgh-based companies moved out.[9]\n\n\nAfter 1990, Pittsburgh transformed into a hub for the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[10] Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Allegheny Health Network, and 68 colleges and universities, including research and development leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[11] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research and the nuclear navy.[12] In the private sector, Pittsburgh-based PNC is the nation's fifth-largest bank, and the city is home to eight Fortune 500 companies, and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. RAND Corporation, BNY Mellon, Nova, FedEx, Bayer, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have regional headquarters and offices that helped Pittsburgh become the sixth-best area for U.S. job growth.[13] Furthermore, the region is a hub for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and energy extraction.[14]\n\n\nPittsburgh's rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[15] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /ˈpɪtsbərə/ *PITS-bər-ə* (similar to Edinburgh).[16][17]\n\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[18]\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[19]\n\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final *h* was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[20][16] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the *h* was reversed.[16] The *Pittsburg Press* continued spelling the city without an *h* until 1921.[21]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Pittsburgh and Name of Pittsburgh\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Pittsburgh.\n\nHistorical claims\n\n\n> \n> French Empire 1669–1758  \n> British Empire 1681–1781  \n> United States 1776–present\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n### Native Americans[edit]\n\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[22] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[23]: 289\n\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution\n\n![](image)Fort Pitt Block House, built by the British in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in Pittsburgh.\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[24][*better source needed*] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[25]\n\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[25] During 1753–1754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[26] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[27]\n\n\nDuring Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[28][29][30][31]\n\n\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[32] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier.\n\n\nOn April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[33][34] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[35]\n\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Viceroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\n![A historic 1857 scene of the Monongahela River in downtown Pittsburgh featuring a steamboat](image)The Monongahela River and its surroundings in 1857\n![](image)Lithograph of Pittsburgh by Otto Krebs (before 1874)\n![](image)Burning of Union Depot during the Pittsburgh railroad strike of 1877\nThe federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition.[36] Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River.[37]\n\n\nThe War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats, that increased trading traffic on the rivers.\n\n\nIn the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, the most came from Germany.\n\n\nBecause Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[38] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[39] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[38]\n\n\nThe American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![Bird's Eye View of Pittsburgh, 1902](image)An aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902[40]\n![](image)Steel mills in the Strip District in 1906\nIn 1901, J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.\n\n\nThe Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk, concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia.[41]\n\n\nThe city suffered severe flooding in March 1936.\n\n\nThe city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[42] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[43] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[44]\n\n\nDuring World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.[27] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"[45][46] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"[47]\n\n\nFollowing World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[9]\n\n\nIn the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nDuring the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.[48]\n\n\nIn September 2009, the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh.[49]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Regional identity\n\n![](image)Downtown Pittsburgh and the Duquesne Incline from Mount Washington\nPittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), or 4.75%, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown.\n\n\nThe city is on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau.[50] The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River. The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as \"the Point.\" The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential.\n\n\nMany Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to \"hills,\" \"heights,\" or similar features.[a]\n\n\nThe steps of Pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.[51] Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.[52]\n\n\nBike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n#### Areas[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Pittsburgh neighborhoods, List of tallest buildings in Pittsburgh, List of City of Pittsburgh historic designations, and List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks\n\n![](image)Pittsburgh's 90 distinct neighborhoods\nThe city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,[53] and four main areas surrounding it. These surrounding areas are subdivided into distinct neighborhoods (Pittsburgh has 90 neighborhoods).[54] Relative to downtown, these areas are known as the Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End.\n\n\n\n##### Golden Triangle[edit]\n\n\nDowntown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine of which top 500 feet (150 m). The U.S. Steel Tower is the tallest, at 841 ft (256 m).[55] The Cultural District consists of a 14-block area of downtown along the Allegheny River. This district contains many theaters and arts venues and is home to a growing residential segment. Most significantly, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is embarking on RiverParc, a four-block mixed-use \"green\" community, featuring 700 residential units and multiple towers of between 20 and 30 stories. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. New condo towers have been constructed and historic office towers are converted to residential use, increasing 24-hour residents. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south.[56] It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown.\n\n\n\n##### North Side[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: North Side (Pittsburgh)\n\n![](image)Townhouses in the Mexican War Streets neighborhood\nThe North Side is home to various neighborhoods in transition. What is known today as Pittsburgh's North Side was once known as Allegheny City, and operated as a city independently of Pittsburgh until it was merged with Pittsburgh in 1907 under great protest from its citizens. The North Side is primarily composed of residential neighborhoods and is noteworthy for its well-constructed and architecturally interesting homes. Many buildings date from the 19th century and are constructed of brick or stone and adorned with decorative woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs and stained glass. The North Side is also home to attractions such as Acrisure Stadium, PNC Park, Carnegie Science Center, National Aviary, Andy Warhol Museum, Mattress Factory art museum, Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, Randyland, Penn Brewery, Allegheny Observatory, and Allegheny General Hospital.[57]\n\n\n\n##### South Side[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: South Side (Pittsburgh)\n\n![](image)East Carson Street in the South Side Flats\nThe South Side was once the site of railyards and associated dense, inexpensive housing for mill and railroad workers. Since the late 20th century, the city undertook a Main Street program in cooperation with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, encouraging design and landscape improvements on East Carson Street, and supporting new retail. The area has become a local Pittsburgher destination, and the value of homes in the South Side had increased in value by about 10% annually for the 10 years up to 2014.[58] East Carson Street has developed as one of the most vibrant areas of the city, packed with diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, vibrant nightlife, and live music venues.\n\n\nIn 1993 the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property. It collaborated with the community and various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development, to include a riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care facilities, and indoor practice fields for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pitt Panthers. Construction began in 1998. The SouthSide Works has been open since 2005, featuring many stores, restaurants, offices, and the world headquarters for American Eagle Outfitters.[59]\n\n\n\n##### East End[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shadyside neighborhood\nThe East End of Pittsburgh is home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University, Chatham University, The Carnegie Institute's Museums of Art and Natural History, Phipps Conservatory, and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall. It is also home to many parks and public spaces including Mellon Park, Westinghouse Park, Schenley Park, Frick Park, The Frick Pittsburgh, Bakery Square, and the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. The neighborhoods of Shadyside and Squirrel Hill are large, wealthy neighborhoods with some apartments and condos, and pedestrian-oriented shopping/business districts. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues.[60] Oakland, heavily populated by undergraduate and graduate students, is home to most of the universities, and the Petersen Events Center. The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. The Hill District was home to photographer Charles Harris as well as various African-American jazz clubs.[61] Other East End neighborhoods include Point Breeze, Regent Square, Highland Park, Homewood, Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar, Larimer, East Hills, East Liberty, Polish Hill, Hazelwood, Garfield, Morningside, and Stanton Heights.\n\n\n\n##### West End[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: West End (Pittsburgh) § Region\n\nThe West End includes Mt. Washington, with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such as Sheraden and Elliott.\n\n\n\n#### Ethnicities[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Pittsburgh is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area, a Combined statistical area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\nPittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the \"northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia.\"[64] In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the \"Paris of Appalachia\",[65][66][67][68] recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 2.6\n\n\n\n36\n\n21\n | 2.4\n\n\n\n39\n\n23\n | 3\n\n\n\n49\n\n30\n | 3.1\n\n\n\n62\n\n40\n | 4\n\n\n\n71\n\n49\n | 4.3\n\n\n\n79\n\n58\n | 3.8\n\n\n\n83\n\n63\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n81\n\n62\n | 3.1\n\n\n\n74\n\n54\n | 2.3\n\n\n\n63\n\n43\n | 3.2\n\n\n\n51\n\n35\n | 2.9\n\n\n\n39\n\n25\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Metric conversion |\n| --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 66\n\n\n\n2\n\n−6\n | 61\n\n\n\n4\n\n−5\n | 75\n\n\n\n10\n\n−1\n | 79\n\n\n\n17\n\n5\n | 100\n\n\n\n22\n\n10\n | 109\n\n\n\n26\n\n15\n | 97\n\n\n\n28\n\n17\n | 88\n\n\n\n27\n\n16\n | 79\n\n\n\n24\n\n12\n | 58\n\n\n\n17\n\n6\n | 82\n\n\n\n11\n\n2\n | 72\n\n\n\n4\n\n−4\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S.[69][70][71] The city and river valleys lie in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b while higher elevated areas and some suburbs lie in zone 6a.[72] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season.[73]\n\n\nThe warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year,[74] a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °F (−1.8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.[74] Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901.[74][b] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.[74]\n\n\nAverage annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018.[75] On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51.[76] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.[77] In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%).\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh International Airport), 1991–2020 normals,[c] extremes 1874–present[d] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 75(24)\n | 78(26)\n | 84(29)\n | 90(32)\n | 95(35)\n | 98(37)\n | 103(39)\n | 103(39)\n | 102(39)\n | 91(33)\n | 82(28)\n | 74(23)\n | 103(39)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 61.5(16.4)\n | 63.2(17.3)\n | 73.5(23.1)\n | 81.5(27.5)\n | 86.8(30.4)\n | 90.4(32.4)\n | 91.3(32.9)\n | 90.3(32.4)\n | 88.2(31.2)\n | 79.9(26.6)\n | 70.8(21.6)\n | 62.6(17.0)\n | 92.6(33.7)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 36.3(2.4)\n | 39.6(4.2)\n | 49.1(9.5)\n | 62.4(16.9)\n | 71.9(22.2)\n | 79.4(26.3)\n | 82.9(28.3)\n | 81.7(27.6)\n | 75.1(23.9)\n | 63.1(17.3)\n | 50.9(10.5)\n | 40.6(4.8)\n | 61.1(16.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 28.8(−1.8)\n | 31.4(−0.3)\n | 39.7(4.3)\n | 51.5(10.8)\n | 61.2(16.2)\n | 69.4(20.8)\n | 73.2(22.9)\n | 71.8(22.1)\n | 64.9(18.3)\n | 53.4(11.9)\n | 42.6(5.9)\n | 33.7(0.9)\n | 51.8(11.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 21.4(−5.9)\n | 23.2(−4.9)\n | 30.3(−0.9)\n | 40.7(4.8)\n | 50.6(10.3)\n | 59.3(15.2)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n | 62.0(16.7)\n | 54.8(12.7)\n | 43.7(6.5)\n | 34.3(1.3)\n | 26.7(−2.9)\n | 42.5(5.8)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 1.0(−17.2)\n | 5.0(−15.0)\n | 11.7(−11.3)\n | 25.4(−3.7)\n | 35.6(2.0)\n | 45.2(7.3)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 51.1(10.6)\n | 41.2(5.1)\n | 29.5(−1.4)\n | 19.3(−7.1)\n | 9.7(−12.4)\n | −1.5(−18.6)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −22(−30)\n | −20(−29)\n | −5(−21)\n | 11(−12)\n | 26(−3)\n | 34(1)\n | 42(6)\n | 39(4)\n | 31(−1)\n | 16(−9)\n | −1(−18)\n | −12(−24)\n | −22(−30)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 2.96(75)\n | 2.62(67)\n | 3.15(80)\n | 3.32(84)\n | 3.83(97)\n | 4.12(105)\n | 4.26(108)\n | 3.52(89)\n | 3.30(84)\n | 2.83(72)\n | 2.86(73)\n | 2.84(72)\n | 39.61(1,006)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 13.3(34)\n | 11.7(30)\n | 7.6(19)\n | 1.0(2.5)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.4(1.0)\n | 2.4(6.1)\n | 7.7(20)\n | 44.1(112)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 16.8\n | 13.9\n | 14.0\n | 13.9\n | 13.5\n | 12.4\n | 11.2\n | 10.5\n | 9.8\n | 11.1\n | 12.0\n | 14.6\n | 153.7\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 12.2\n | 9.3\n | 5.9\n | 1.6\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.3\n | 3.3\n | 7.6\n | 40.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 69.9\n | 67.3\n | 64.1\n | 59.8\n | 63.4\n | 66.2\n | 68.8\n | 71.2\n | 72.0\n | 68.3\n | 70.2\n | 71.9\n | 67.8\n |\n| Average dew point °F (°C)\n | 17.2(−8.2)\n | 18.9(−7.3)\n | 26.8(−2.9)\n | 34.5(1.4)\n | 45.9(7.7)\n | 55.2(12.9)\n | 60.1(15.6)\n | 59.5(15.3)\n | 53.4(11.9)\n | 40.8(4.9)\n | 32.4(0.2)\n | 23.2(−4.9)\n | 39.0(3.9)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 93.9\n | 108.5\n | 155.4\n | 182.8\n | 217.4\n | 242.2\n | 254.9\n | 228.4\n | 196.7\n | 167.3\n | 99.4\n | 74.4\n | 2,021.3\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 31\n | 36\n | 42\n | 46\n | 49\n | 54\n | 56\n | 54\n | 53\n | 48\n | 33\n | 26\n | 45\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | 6\n | 6\n | 6\n | 5\n | 4\n | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 4\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA (relative humidity, dew point and sun 1961–1990)[74][78][73][79] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[80] |\n\n#### Air quality[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, the \"State of the Air\" report from the American Lung Association (ALA) found that air quality in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV metro area worsened, not only for ozone (smog), but also for the second year in a row for both the daily and long-term measures of fine particle pollution. Outside of California, Allegheny County is the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.[81]\n\n\nIn a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the American Lung Association ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas.[82][83] The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works, the nation's largest coke mill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey.[84] The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia.[85]\n\n\nAlthough the county was still below the \"pass\" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.[86] ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated \"It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ... We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years, or more.\"[87]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched. As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities.[88]\n\n\nThe city contains 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets, by the last count conducted in 2005. A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh's tree cover, which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city, showed a value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits based on the urban forest contributions to aesthetics, energy use and air quality. Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Water quality[edit]\n\n\nThe local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits.[90] This is caused by frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has a combined sewer system, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959.[91] Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water.[92] As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers.[93] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[94] The local sewage authority, Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from the EPA to come up with solutions.[95] In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2 billion upgrade to the system which is moving closer to EPA approval.[96]\n\n\nPittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement.[97] In 2017, Mayor William Peduto advocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority.[98] Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).[97]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1800 | 1,565 |  | — |\n| 1810 | 4,768 |  | 204.7% |\n| 1820 | 7,248 |  | 52.0% |\n| 1830 | 12,568 |  | 73.4% |\n| 1840 | 21,115 |  | 68.0% |\n| 1850 | 46,601 |  | 120.7% |\n| 1860 | 49,221 |  | 5.6% |\n| 1870 | 86,076 |  | 74.9% |\n| 1880 | 156,389 |  | 81.7% |\n| 1890 | 238,617 |  | 52.6% |\n| 1900 | 321,616 |  | 34.8% |\n| 1910 | 533,905 |  | 66.0% |\n| 1920 | 588,343 |  | 10.2% |\n| 1930 | 669,817 |  | 13.8% |\n| 1940 | 671,659 |  | 0.3% |\n| 1950 | 676,806 |  | 0.8% |\n| 1960 | 604,332 |  | −10.7% |\n| 1970 | 520,117 |  | −13.9% |\n| 1980 | 423,938 |  | −18.5% |\n| 1990 | 369,879 |  | −12.8% |\n| 2000 | 334,563 |  | −9.5% |\n| 2010 | 305,704 |  | −8.6% |\n| 2020 | 302,971 |  | −0.9% |\n| 2022 (est.) | 302,898 |  | 0.0% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[99][100][2] |\n\n\nAt the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race.

The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance, education, and services. Annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion in 2007,[119] and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies.[120] A National Bureau of Economic Research 2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobility[121] or the American Dream.[122] Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been renovated as modern office space. Google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 1918–1998 Nabisco factory, a complex known as Bakery Square.[123] Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots.[124] Pittsburgh's transition from its industrial heritage has earned it praise as \"the poster child for managing industrial transition\".[125] Other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh's model in order to renew their industries and economic base.[126]\n\n\nThe largest employer in the city is the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, with 48,000 employees. All hospitals, outpatient clinics, and doctor's office positions combine for 116,000 jobs, approximately 10% of the jobs in the region. An analyst recently observed of the city's medical sector: \"That's both more jobs and a higher share of the region's total employment than the steel industry represented in the 1970s.\"[127]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Top publicly traded companiesin the Pittsburgh region for 2022**(ranked by revenues)*with metropolitan and U.S. ranks* |\n| **Metro** |  | **corporation** |  | **US** |  |\n| 1 |  | The Kraft Heinz Company |  | 139\n |  |\n| 2 |  | U.S. Steel |  | 172\n |  |\n| 3 |  | PNC Financial Services |  | 178\n |  |\n| 4 |  | Viatris |  | 204\n |  |\n| 5 |  | PPG Industries |  | 218\n |  |\n| 6 |  | Dick's Sporting Goods |  | 307\n |  |\n| 7 |  | Alcoa |  | 312\n |  |\n| 8 |  | WESCO International |  | 357\n |  |\n| 9 |  | Wabtec |  | 439\n |  |\n| 10 |  | Arconic |  | 452\n |  |\n|  |\n\n Education is a major economic driver in the region.

Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, David McCullough was born and raised in Pittsburgh.[159] Annie Dillard, a Pulitzer Prize–winning writer, was born and raised in Pittsburgh. Much of her memoir *An American Childhood* takes place in post-World War II Pittsburgh. Award-winning author John Edgar Wideman grew up in Pittsburgh and has based several of his books, including the memoir *Brothers and Keepers*, in his hometown. Poet Terrance Hayes, winner of the 2010 National Book Award and a 2014 MacArthur Foundation Fellow, received his MFA from the University of Pittsburgh, where he is a faculty member. Poet Michael Simms, founder of Autumn House Press, resides in the Mount Washington neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Poet Samuel John Hazo, the first poet Laureate of Pennsylvania, resides in the city. New writers include Chris Kuzneski, who attended the University of Pittsburgh and mentions Pittsburgh in his works, and Pittsburgher Brian Celio, author of *Catapult Soul*, who captured the Pittsburgh 'Yinzer' dialect in his writing. Pittsburgh's unique literary style extends to playwrights,[160] as well as local graffiti and hip hop artists.\n\n\nPittsburgh's position as the birthplace for community owned television and networked commercial television helped spawn the modern children's show genres exemplified by *Mister Rogers' Neighborhood*, *Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?*, *Happy's Party*, *Cappelli & Company*, and *The Children's Corner*, all nationally broadcast.\n\n\nThe *Pittsburgh Dad* series has showcased the Pittsburghese genre to a global YouTube audience since 2011.\n\n\nThe modern fantasy, macabre and science fiction genre was popularized by director George A. Romero, television's Bill Cardille and his *Chiller Theatre*,[161] director and writer Rusty Cundieff and makeup effects guru Tom Savini.[162] The genre continues today with the PARSEC science fiction organization,[163] The It's Alive Show, the annual \"Zombie Fest\",[164] and several writer's workshops including Write or Die,[165] Pittsburgh SouthWrites,[166] and Pittsburgh Worldwrights[167][168] with Barton Paul Levenson, Kenneth Chiacchia and Elizabeth Humphreys Penrose.\n\n\n\n### Food[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Primanti Bros. sandwich\nPittsburgh is known for several specialties including pierogies, kielbasa, chipped chopped ham sandwiches, and Klondike bars.[169][170] In 2019, Pittsburgh was deemed \"Food City of the Year\" by the San Francisco-based restaurant and hospitality consulting firm af&co.[171] Many restaurants were favorably mentioned, among them were Superior Motors in Braddock, Driftwood Oven in Lawrenceville, Spork in Bloomfield, Fish nor Fowl in Garfield, Bitter Ends Garden & Luncheonette in Bloomfield, and Rolling Pepperoni in Lawrenceville.[172]\n\n\nPittsburgh is home to the annual pickle-themed festival Picklesburgh, which has been named the \"best specialty food festival in America\".[173]\n\n\n\n### Local dialect[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Western Pennsylvania English\n\nThe Pittsburgh English dialect, commonly called *Pittsburghese*, was influenced by Scots-Irish, German, and Eastern European immigrants and African Americans.[174] Locals who speak the dialect are sometimes referred to as \"Yinzers\" (from the local word \"yinz\" [var. *yunz*], a blended form of \"you ones\", similar to \"y'all\" and \"you all\" in the South). Common Pittsburghese terms are: \"slippy\" (slippery), \"redd up\" (clean up), \"jagger bush\" (thorn bush), and \"gum bands\" (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb \"to be\". In Pittsburghese one would say \"the car needs washed\" instead of \"needs to be washed\", \"needs washing\", or \"needs a wash.\" The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore, but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted *The New York Times* to describe Pittsburgh as \"the Galapagos Islands of American dialect\".[175] The lexicon itself contains notable loans from Polish and other European languages; examples include *babushka*, *pierogi*, and *halušky*.[176]\n\n\n\n### Livability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Frick Environmental Center at Frick Park\nPittsburgh has five city parks and several parks managed by the Nature Conservancy. The largest, Frick Park, provides 664 acres (269 ha) of woodland park with extensive hiking and biking trails throughout steep valleys and wooded slopes. Birding enthusiasts visit the Clayton Hill area of Frick Park, where over 100 species of birds have been recorded.[177]\n\n\nResidents living in extremely low-lying areas near the rivers or one of the 1,400 creeks and streams may have occasional floods,[178] such as those caused when the remnants of Hurricane Ivan hit rainfall records in 2004.[179] River flooding is relatively rare due to federal flood control efforts extensively managing locks, dams, and reservoirs.[178][180][181] Residents living near smaller tributary streams are less protected from occasional flooding. The cost of a comprehensive flood control program for the region has been estimated at a prohibitive $50 billion.[178]\n\n\nPittsburgh has the greatest number of bars per capita in the nation.[15]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Pittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh hosted the first professional football game and the first World Series. In 2009, Pittsburgh won the *Sporting News* title of \"Best Sports City\" in the United States[182] and, in 2013, *Sperling's Best Places* \"top 15 cities for baseball\".[183] College sports also have large followings with the University of Pittsburgh in football and sharing Division I basketball fans with Robert Morris and Duquesne.\n\n\nPittsburgh has a long history with its major professional sports teams—the Steelers of the National Football League, the Penguins of the National Hockey League, and the Pirates of Major League Baseball—which all share the same team colors, the official city colors of black and gold.[f] Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States where this practice of sharing team colors in solidarity takes place.[184] The black-and-gold color scheme has since become widely associated with the city and personified in its famous Terrible Towel.[185]\n\n\nThe Pittsburgh Riverhounds are a professional soccer team who have been playing in Pittsburgh since they were established in 1999. They are a member of the USL Championship division, a second-tier league of US professional soccer and are in the league's Eastern Conference. The Riverhounds play their home matches at Highmark Stadium (Pennsylvania) a 5,000 seat soccer-specific stadium located in Pittsburgh's Station Square. In keeping with the uniformity of professional sports teams in Pittsburgh, the Riverhounds colors are black and gold.\n\n\n\"Rails to Trails\", has converted miles of former rail tracks to recreational trails, including a Pittsburgh-Washington D.C. bike/walking trail.[186] Several mountain biking trails are within the city and suburbs, Frick Park has biking trails and Hartwood Acres Park has many miles of single track trails.[187][188]\n\n\n\n### Professional[edit]\n\n\n**Major league**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Founded\n | League\n | Sport\n | Venue\n | Championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pittsburgh Pirates | 1882\n | Major League Baseball (MLB)\n | Baseball | PNC Park | 7[o 1] |\n| Pittsburgh Steelers | 1933\n | National Football League (NFL)\n | Football | Acrisure Stadium | 6[o 2] |\n| Pittsburgh Penguins | 1967\n | National Hockey League (NHL)\n | Hockey | PPG Paints Arena | 5[o 3] |\n\n\n**Minor league/other**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Founded\n | League\n | Sport\n | Venue\n | Championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pittsburgh Riverhounds | 1999\n | USL Championship (USLC)\n | Soccer\n | Highmark Stadium |  |\n| Steel City Yellow Jackets | 2014\n | ABA | Basketball | CCAC Allegheny Arena | 1\n |\n\n\n1. **^** The Pirates won championships in 1901, 1902, 1909, 1925, 1960, 1971, and 1979. 1901 and 1902 were Pre World-Series Era Champions.\n2. **^** The Steelers won championships in 1974, 1975, 1978, 1979, 2005, and 2008.\n3. **^** The Penguins won championships in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017.\n\n\\*\\*Pittsburgh's ABA franchise won the 1968 title, but the Steel City Yellow Jackets franchise is heir to it only in location.\n\n\n\n### College[edit]\n\n\n**Power 5**\n\n\n\n\n\n| School\n | Prominent sports\n | Venues\n | Conference\n | National Championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| University of Pittsburgh | Pitt Football (FBS)\n | Acrisure Stadium | ACC | 9[o 1] |\n| Pitt Basketball | Petersen Events Center | 1927–28 1929–30 |\n\n\n**Other**\n\n\n\n\n\n| School\n | Prominent sports\n | Venues\n | Conference\n | National Championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Duquesne University | Dukes Football (FCS)\n | Art Rooney Field | NEC | 1941, 1973, 2003 |\n| Dukes Basketball | UPMC Cooper Fieldhouse | A10 | 1954–55 (NIT)\n |\n| Robert Morris University | Colonials Basketball | UPMC Events Center | NEC |  |\n| Colonials Hockey | Island Sports Center | AHA |  |\n\n\n1. **^** The Panthers won championships in 1915, 1916, 1918, 1929, 1931, 1934, 1936, 1937, and 1976.\n\n### Baseball[edit]\n\n\n![](image)PNC Park, home stadium of the Pittsburgh Pirates\n> \n> [t]his is the perfect blend of location, history, design, comfort and baseball ...

The Pirates are nine-time Pennant winners and five-time World Series Champions, were in the first World Series (1903) and claim two pre-World Series titles in 1901 and 1902. The Pirates play in PNC Park.\n\n\nPittsburgh also has a rich Negro league history, with the former Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays credited with as many as 14 league titles and 11 Hall of Famers between them in the 1930s and 1940s, while the Keystones fielded teams in the 1920s. In addition, in 1971 the Pirates were the first Major League team to field an all-minority lineup. One sportswriter claimed, \"No city is more synonymous with black baseball than Pittsburgh.\"[189]\n\n\nSince the late 20th century, the Pirates had three consecutive National League Championship Series appearances (1990–92) (going 6, 7 and 7 games each), followed by setting the MLB record for most consecutive losing seasons, with 20 from 1993 until 2012. This era was followed by three consecutive postseason appearances: the 2013 National League Division Series and the 2014–2015 Wild Card games. Their September pennant race in 1997 featured the franchises' last no-hitter and last award for Sporting News' Executive of the Year.[190]\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: American football in Western Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

News of the team has preempted news of elections and other events, and are important to the region and its diaspora. The Steelers have been owned by the Rooney family since the team's founding in 1933, show consistency in coaching (only three coaches since the 1960s all with the same basic philosophy) and are noted as one of sports' most respectable franchises.[191] The Steelers have a long waiting list for season tickets, and have sold out every home game since 1972.[192] The team won four Super Bowls in a six-year span in the 1970s, a fifth Super Bowl in 2006, and a league record sixth Super Bowl in 2009. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 they have qualified for the most NFL playoff berths (28) and have played in (15) and hosted (11) the most NFL conference championship games.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHigh school football routinely attract 10,000 fans per game and extensive press coverage.[*citation needed*] The Tom Cruise film All the Right Moves and ESPN's Bound for Glory with Dick Butkus both filmed in the area to capture the tradition and passion of local high school football.\n\n\nCollege football in the city dates to 1889 with the Division I (FBS) Panthers of the University of Pittsburgh posting nine national championships and qualifying 34 total bowl games and appearing in the 2018 ACC Championship Game. Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris have loyal fan bases that follow their lower (FCS) teams. Duquesne, Carnegie Mellon University, and Washington & Jefferson College all posted major bowl games and AP Poll rankings from the 1920s to the 1940s as that era's equivalent of Top 25 FBS programs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAcrisure Stadium serves as home for the Steelers, Panthers, and both the suburban and city high school championships. Playoff franchises Pittsburgh Power and Pittsburgh Gladiators competed in the Arena Football League in the 1980s and 2010s respectively. The Gladiators hosted ArenaBowl I in the city, competing in two, but losing both before moving to Tampa, Florida and becoming the Storm.[193] The Pittsburgh Passion has been the city's professional women's football team since 2002 and plays its home games at Highmark Stadium. The Ed Debartolo owned Pittsburgh Maulers featured a Heisman Trophy winner in the mid-1980s, former superstar University of Nebraska running back Mike Rozier.\n\n\n\n### Hockey[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The team has won 6 Eastern Conference titles (1991, 1992, 2008, 2009, 2016 and 2017) and 5 Stanley Cup championships (1991, 1992, 2009, 2016 and 2017). Since 1999, Hall of Famer and back-to-back playoff MVP Mario Lemieux has served as Penguins owner. Until moving into the PPG Paints Arena in 2010 (when it was known as Consol Energy Center), the team played their home games at the world's first retractable domed stadium, the Civic Arena, or in local parlance \"The Igloo\".[194]\n\n\nIce hockey has had a regional fan base since the 1890s semi-pro Keystones. The city's first ice rink dates back to 1889, when there was an ice rink at the Casino in Schenley Park. From 1896 to 1956, the Exposition Building on the Allegheny River near The Point and Duquesne Gardens in Oakland offered indoor skating.[195]\n\n\nThe NHL awarded one of its first franchises to the city in 1924 on the strength of the back-to-back USAHA championship winning Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets featuring future Hall of Famers and a Stanley Cup winning coach. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates made several Stanley Cup playoff runs with a future Hall of Famer before folding from Great Depression financial pressures. Hockey survived with the Pittsburgh Hornets farm team (1936–1967) and their seven finals appearances and three championships in 18 playoff seasons.\n\n\nRobert Morris University fields a Division I college hockey team at the Island Sports Center. Pittsburgh has semi-pro and amateur teams such as the Pittsburgh Penguins Elite.[196] Pro-grade ice rinks such as the Rostraver Ice Garden, Mt. Lebanon Recreation Center and Iceoplex at Southpointe have trained several native Pittsburgh players for NHL play. RMU hosted the city's first Frozen Four college championship in 2013 with the four PPG Paints Arena games televised by ESPN.\n\n\n\n### Basketball[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Pitt Panthers men's basketball game at the Petersen Events Center in 2009\nProfessional basketball in Pittsburgh dates to the 1910s with teams \"Monticello\" and \"Loendi\" winning five national titles, the Pirates (1937–45 in the NBL), the Pittsburgh Ironmen (1947–48 NBA inaugural season), the Pittsburgh Rens (1961–63), the Pittsburgh Pipers (first American Basketball Association championship in 1968) led by Connie Hawkins (team then moved); the Pittsburgh Condors (ABA returned in 1970–72), the Pittsburgh Piranhas (CBA Finals in 1995), the Pittsburgh Xplosion (2004–08) and Phantoms (2009–10) both of the ABA. The city has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular season \"neutral site\" NBA games, including Wilt Chamberlain's record setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand.[197]\n\n\nThe Duquesne University Dukes and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers have played college basketball in the city since 1914 and 1905 respectively. Pitt and Duquesne have played the annual City Game since 1932.\nDuquesne was the city's first team to appear in a Final Four (1940), obtain a number one AP Poll ranking (1954),[198] and to win a post-season national title, the 1955 National Invitation Tournament on its second straight trip to the NIT title game. Duquesne is the only college program to produce back-to-back NBA No. 1 overall draft picks with 1955's Dick Ricketts and 1956's Sihugo Green.[199] Duquesne's Chuck Cooper was the first African American drafted by an NBA team.[200]\n\n\nThe Panthers won two pre-tournament era Helms Athletic Foundation National Championships in 1928 and 1930, competed in a \"national title game\" against LSU in 1935, and made a Final Four appearance in 1941. Pitt has won 13 conference titles, qualified for the NCAA tournament 26 times including a post season tournament every season between 1999 and 2000 and 2015–2016 during which time it regularly sold out the Petersen Events Center. The program has produced 27 NBA draft picks and 15 All Americans while ranking No. 1 in the nation as recently as 2009.\n\n\nThe suburban Robert Morris University's Colonials have competed in NCAA Division I basketball since the 1970s, qualifying for the NCAA tournament in each of the last four decades (8). In the 2013 National Invitation Tournament the Colonials notched an upset win over the defending national champions Kentucky Wildcats.\n\n\nPittsburgh Panthers women's basketball has qualified for 14 post season tournaments (including 4 NCAA tournaments) and boasts of 5 All-Americans selected 6 times with 3 WNBA players. Pitt women began play in 1914 before being reintroduced in 1970. Both Duquesne and Robert Morris also have competitive Division I women's basketball programs.\n\n\nPittsburgh launched the nation's first high school all-star game in 1965.[201] The Roundball Classic annually featured future NBA hall of famers at the Civic Arena with ESPN televising. The Civic Arena also hosted the championship tournament for the Eastern Eight Conference from 1978 until 1982.\n\n\n\n### Soccer[edit]\n\n\nThe Riverhounds, an American professional soccer team, were founded in 1998. Like the major league teams in the city, the Riverhounds wear black and gold kits. The club plays in the Eastern Conference of the USL Championship, the second tier of the American soccer pyramid.

In November 2021, Pittsburgh elected its first African-American mayor, Ed Gainey.\n\n\nPrior to the American Civil War, Pittsburgh was strongly abolitionist. It is considered the birthplace of the national Republican Party,[203] as the party held its first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. The effects of the Great Depression, combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a shift among voters to the Democratic Party. With the exceptions of the 1973 and 1977 elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), Democrats have been elected consecutively to the mayor's office since the 1933 election. The city's ratio of party registration is 5 to 1 Democrat.[204]\n\n\nPittsburgh is represented in the Pennsylvania General Assembly by three Senate Districts (Lindsey Williams (D)-38, Wayne D. Fontana (D)-42, and Jay Costa (D)-43) and nine House Districts (Aerion Abney-19, Adam Ravenstahl-20, Sara Innamorato-21, Dan Frankel-23, Martell Covington-24, Dan Deasy-27, Summer Lee-34, and Harry Readshaw-36, Dan Miller-42).\n\n\nFederally, Pittsburgh is part of Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, represented by Democrat Summer Lee since 2023 and also by Democrat Chris Deluzio.\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Ford Taurus and a Chevrolet Impala belonging to the Pittsburgh Police\nThe area's largest law enforcement agency is the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, with close to 850 sworn officers.

Crimes of a federal nature are covered by the U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n### Crime[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh annually ranks as one of America's safest big cities, in 2013 being named the 3rd \"most secure\" big city by Farmers Insurance.[205] Among crime rates of the 60 largest U.S. cities, 43 had more instances of property crime while 16 had less when compared to Pittsburgh. More instances of violent crime were reported in 21 of the largest cities while 37 had less. The FBI recommends against using data for ranking.[206][207]\nPer 100,000 persons stats (2012):\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Murder | Rape | Robbery | Assault | Burglary | Theft | Motor vehicle | Total violent | Total property\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City | 13.1 | 15.1 | 363.3 | 360.4 | 812.8 | 2,438.2 | 174.3 | 752.0 | 3,425.4\n |\n\n\nAt the end of 2019, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police reported 37 murders in the city that year.[208]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n### Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of colleges and universities in Pittsburgh\n\n![](image)The Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh\n![](image)The main campus of Carnegie Mellon University\nPittsburgh is home to many colleges, universities and research facilities, the most well-known of which are Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne University.

Three non-commercial stations are run by Carnegie Mellon University (WRCT 88.3 FM), the University of Pittsburgh (WPTS 92.1 FM), and Point Park University (WPPJ 670 AM).\n\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh's 116-year-old film industry accelerated after the 2006 passage of the Pennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit.[221] According to the Pittsburgh Film Office, over 124 major motion pictures have been filmed, in whole or in part, in Pittsburgh, including *The Mothman Prophecies*, *Wonder Boys*,[222] *Dogma*,[222] *Hoffa*, *The Silence of the Lambs*,[222] *Sudden Death*, *Flashdance*,[222] *Southpaw*, *Striking Distance*, *Mrs. Soffel*, *Jack Reacher*, *Inspector Gadget*, *The Next Three Days*, *The Perks of Being a Wallflower*,[222] *Zack and Miri Make a Porno*, and *Fences*.[222][223] Pittsburgh became \"Gotham City\" in 2011 during filming of *The Dark Knight Rises*.[133] George A. Romero shot nearly all his films in the area, including his *Living Dead* series.[224]\n\n\nFilm production in Pittsburgh has notably impacted the region's economy and job creation, largely due to the 25% tax credit incentive established in 2007.[225][226] The Pittsburgh Film Office states that the film and television industry provides employment to over 10,000 people and pays over $500 million in wages in southwestern Pennsylvania.[227] Furthermore, the industry supports over 345,000 local businesses and contributes over $41 billion to them.[226]\n\n\nFrom 2017 to 2023, Pittsburgh has welcomed a series of major film and television productions like *Fences*, *Mindhunter*, *Ma Rainey's Black Bottom*, *Sweet Girl*, and *I'm Your Woman*.[228] These productions have significantly contributed to the local economy by hiring local personnel, leasing local facilities and equipment, purchasing local goods and services, and enhancing local tourism and visibility.[229]\n\n\nIn addition to a thriving film industry, Pittsburgh is home to several film festivals, film schools, and organizations that encourage and promote independent and diverse filmmakers. Notable film festivals include the Three Rivers Film Festival, the Pittsburgh Shorts Film Festival, the JFilm Festival, the ReelAbilities Film Festival, and the Black Bottom Film Festival.[230][231] The local film schools include Pittsburgh Filmmakers, Point Park University - Cinema & Digital Arts, and University of Pittsburgh - Film Studies.[232][233]\n\n\nMoreover, Pittsburgh is developing a robust film studio infrastructure, with several sound stages and production facilities available for hire. Prominent film studios in Pittsburgh are 3 Rivers Studios, Cinelease Studios, Post Script Films, Deeplocal, and The Videohouse.[234][235][236][237][238] There are also plans in the pipeline to develop a new film studio complex at the Carrie Furnace site in Rankin and Swissvale.[239]\n\n\n\n## Utilities[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Allegheny County Sanitary Authority\n\nThe city is served by Duquesne Light, one of the original 1912 power companies founded by George Westinghouse.[240] Water service is provided by the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority[241] and Pennsylvania American Water. Natural gas is provided by Equitable Gas, Columbia Gas, Dominion Resources, Direct Energy, and Novec.[242]\n\n\n\n## Health care[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of hospitals in Pittsburgh\n\n![](image)UPMC's flagship, UPMC Presbyterian\n![](image)Allegheny General Hospital, the flagship of the Allegheny Health Network\nThe two largest area health care providers are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) (since 1893) and Allegheny Health Network (since 1882). Both hospitals annually rank as among the best overall in the United States, with UPMC ranked among *U.S. News & World Report*'s \"Honor Roll\" every year since 2000.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe first military hospital in U.S. history and the first west of the Atlantic Plain—General Edward Hand Hospital—served the area from 1777 to 1845.[243] Since 1847, Pittsburgh has hosted the world's first \"Mercy Hospital\".[244] This was followed by West Penn hospital in 1848, Passavant Hospital in 1849,[25] the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1883, Children's Hospital in 1887, and Magee Womens Hospital in 1911. In 1954, Allegheny General (AGH) was among the first to administer Cobalt therapy.[245]\n\n\nIn 1980, UPMC announced a $250 million ($1.05 billion today) expansion and also hired transplant pioneer Thomas Starzl.[246] In 1984, Allegheny General surgeons pioneered modern brain surgery. Starzl arranged the 1985 liver transplant of 5-year-old Amie Garrison as a UPMC surgery team flew to Baylor University, starting its transplant program.[247] Also in 1985, UPMC surgeons Drs. Griffith, Hardesty, and Trento revealed a new device after a heart-lung transplant. In 1986, UPMC announced a $230 million ($639 million today) modernization. In 1996, UPMC's planned Sicily ISMETT branch was approved by the Italian government as transplant surgeons to supervise and deliver the world's third (both earlier ones done at UPMC)--and first public—cross species marrow transplant at University of California, San Francisco.[248] UPMC's Thomas Detre founded the International Society for Bipolar Disorders at a world medical conference in Pittsburgh in 1999.[249]\n\n\nThe $80 million ($142 million today) UPMC Sports Performance Complex for the Pittsburgh Panthers & Pittsburgh Steelers opened in 2000. In 2002, AGH opened its $30 million ($51.6 million today), 5-floor, 100,000 sq. ft., cancer center. The $130 million ($220 million today) 350,000 sq. ft. Hillman Cancer Center opened in 2003 as UPMC entered into an 8-year, $420 million ($678 million today) agreement with IBM to upgrade medical technologies & health information systems.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2009, the $600 million ($849 million today) UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh opened. The campus was featured in world news in 2012 for several unique approaches to patient care.[250] UPMC officially adopted in Erie, Pennsylvania's Hamot Medical Center in 2010. The Pittsburgh Penguins announced a state of the art training facility with UPMC in 2012.[251] UPMC announced in 2013 it had partnered with Nazarbayev University to help found its medical school.[252]\n\n\n\n### Health discoveries[edit]\n\n\nWhile he was a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, American virologist Jonas Salk developed one of the first successful polio vaccines, which came into use in 1955.\n\n\nUPMC has pioneered several world firsts including the first known cystic fibrosis heart-lung transplant (1983), the world's first simultaneous liver and heart transplant operation on a child (6-year-old Stormie Jones in 1984), the youngest heart-lung transplant (9 years old in 1985), the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant (1989), the world's first heart-liver transplant on an infant (1997),[253] the first pediatric heart-double lung-liver transplant (1998), the nation's first double hand transplant (2009), and the first total forearm and hand transplant (2010), as well as the state's first heart transplant (1968).[254][255]\n\n\n*The Lancet* published a 2012 UPMC study of two 9-year quadriplegics being able to move a robotic arm by thought, to pick up objects, shake hands, and even eat. Wiring the brain around spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle function was successful using robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer to translate signals near a small group of neurons with 200 needles.[256]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Pittsburgh\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Pittsburgh's numerous bridges\nPittsburgh is a city of bridges. With 446,[257] it has three bridges more than Venice, Italy, which has historically held the title \"City of Bridges.\"[258] Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city. The Smithfield Street Bridge was the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The city's Three Sisters Bridges offer a picturesque view of the city from the North. The south-western \"entrance\" to Downtown for travelers coming in from Interstate 79 and the Pittsburgh International Airport is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Fort Duquesne Bridge carrying Interstate 279 is the main gateway from Downtown to both PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium and the Rivers Casino. The Panhandle Bridge carries Pittsburgh Regional Transit's Blue/Red/Silver subway lines across the Monongahela River. The renovated J&L Steel Company bridge has been a key traffic/running-biking trail conduit connecting the Southside Works and Pittsburgh Technology Center. Over 2,000 bridges span the landscape of Allegheny County.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Public transportation statistics[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh is served by Pittsburgh Regional Transit, the 26th-largest transit agency in the country prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Pittsburgh, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 73 min. 23% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 minutes, while 33% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 3.9 mi (6.3 km), while 11% travel for over 7.5 mi (12 km) in a single direction.[259]\n\n\n\n### Expressways and highways[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Expressways\n | Other Highways\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Parkway North | ![](image) | US 19 | ![](image) PA 88 |\n| ![](image)![](image) ![](image) | Parkway East & West | ![](image)![](image) | TruckUS 19 | ![](image) PA 121 |\n| ![](image) | Crosstown | ![](image) | PA 8 | ![](image) PA 130 |\n| ![](image) | Allegheny Valley Expressway | ![](image) | PA 50 | ![](image) PA 380 |\n| ![](image) | Ohio River Boulevard | ![](image) | PA 51 | ![](image) PA 837 |\n|   |   | ![](image) | PA 60 | ![](image) PA 885 |\n\n\n![](image)I-279\nLocals refer to the interstates fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the \"parkways.\" Interstate 376 is both the \"parkway east\" connecting to Interstate 76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) and the \"parkway west\" connecting to Interstate 79, the Pittsburgh International Airport, the Ohio end of the Turnpike and Interstate 80. The \"parkway north\" is Interstate 279 connecting to I-79. The \"crosstown\" is Interstate 579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the Liberty Tunnels and the PPG Paints Arena. The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long expressway sections of Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. Interstate 70, 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped \"beltway\" with Interstate 68 and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the Mon–Fayette Expressway, Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 66 also help traffic flow. The non-expressway Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System serves navigation in the region.\n\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Airports\n\nPittsburgh International Airport provides commercial passenger service from over 15 airlines to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Arnold Palmer Regional Airport also provides limited commercial passenger service and is 44 miles (71 km) east of Pittsburgh.\n\n\nOther airports that have or have had scheduled commercial service include Morgantown Municipal Airport (79 miles (127 km) south of Pittsburgh), Youngstown–Warren Regional Airport (81 miles (130 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Akron–Canton Airport (120 miles (190 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Johnstown–Cambria County Airport (60 miles (97 km) east of Pittsburgh) and Erie International Airport (123 miles (198 km) north of Pittsburgh).\n\n\n\n### Intercity passenger rail and bus[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Union Station (Pittsburgh) and Grant Street Transportation Center\n\nAmtrak provides intercity rail service to Pittsburgh Union Station, via the *Capitol Limited* between Chicago and Washington, D.C., and the *Pennsylvanian* to New York City.\n\n\nMegabus, Greyhound Lines, and Fullington Trailways connect Pittsburgh with distant cities by bus; Greyhound and Fullington Trailways buses stop at the Grant Street Transportation Center intercity bus terminal. Popular destinations include Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington, D.C.[260]\n\n\nUntil declines in passenger travel in the 1950s and 1960s, several stations served Pittsburgh: Baltimore & Ohio Station, Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station, Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal and Pittsburgh Union Station.\n\n\n\n### Regional mass transit[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Pittsburgh Light Rail and Port Authority of Allegheny County § Bus rapid transit\n\n![](image)Steel Plaza subway station\nPittsburgh Regional Transit, formerly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area, the nation's 20th-largest metropolitan area, it is the 11th-largest transit agency in the United States.[261] Pittsburgh Regional Transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline Funicular railway (more commonly known as an \"incline\") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems.[262] Pittsburgh Regional Transit owns the Duquesne Incline but it is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,[263] but accepts Pittsburgh Regional Transit passes and charges PRT fares.\n\n\nThe Bus System lines are labeled by number and letter. These are the largest portion of Pittsburgh Regional Transit and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as Pittsburgh International Airport, Monroeville, McCandless, and the borders of Westmoreland County and Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the \"T\") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, and Beechview, and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook.\n\n\n\n### Freight rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Union Station, built in 1903\nPittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the city and Philadelphia, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865 Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869.\n\n\nPittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard, built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S. also has major operations around Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\n### Port[edit]\n\n\nThe Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 20th-largest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011, the port ranked ninth-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[264]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Pittsburgh\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh's sister cities are:[265]\n\n\n\n* ![Spain](image) Bilbao, Spain\n* ![Vietnam](image) Da Nang, Vietnam\n* ![Paraguay](image) Fernando de la Mora, Paraguay\n* ![Turkey](image) Gaziantep, Turkey\n* ![Scotland](image) Glasgow, Scotland\n* ![Israel](image) Karmiel, Israel\n* ![Cuba](image) Matanzas, Cuba\n* ![Israel](image) Misgav, Israel\n* ![Mexico](image) Naucalpan, Mexico\n* ![Czech Republic](image) Ostrava, Czech Republic\n* ![Slovakia](image) Prešov, Slovakia\n* ![Germany](image) Saarbrücken, Germany\n* ![Japan](image) Saitama, Japan\n* ![Nicaragua](image) San Isidro, Nicaragua\n* ![England](image) Sheffield, England[g]\n* ![North Macedonia](image) Skopje, North Macedonia\n* ![Bulgaria](image) Sofia, Bulgaria\n* ![China](image) Wuhan, China\n* ![Croatia](image) Zagreb, Croatia\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n* Greater Pittsburgh Region\n* List of fiction set in Pittsburgh\n* List of municipalities in Pennsylvania\n* List of people from Pittsburgh\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The neighborhoods are Arlington Heights, Bluff, Brighton Heights, Crafton Heights, Duquesne Heights, East Hills, Fineview, Highland Park, Middle Hill, Mount Oliver, Mount Washington, Northview Heights, Perry North (also known as Observatory Hill), Perry South (also known as Perry Hilltop), Polish Hill, Ridgemont, South Side Slopes, Spring Hill-City View, Squirrel Hill, Stanton Heights, Summer Hill, Troy Hill, and Upper Hill.\n2. **^** The warmest daily minimum at the current observation location, Pittsburgh Int'l, is only 77 °F (25 °C) on July 23, 2010, and July 16, 1980.[74]\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n4. **^** Records kept September 1874 to June 1935 at the Weather Bureau Office across the Allegheny River from downtown, at Allegheny County Airport from July 1935 to 14 September 1952, and at Pittsburgh Int'l (KPIT) since 15 September 1952. Due to its river valley and urban location as well as elevation, many of the summertime warm minima temperature records set at the WBO have not even come close to being matched at KPIT, which is at-elevation and located in the western suburbs.

It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S. with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area of Western Pennsylvania; its population of 2.457 million is the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Furthermore, it is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area that extends into Ohio and West Virginia.\n\n\nPittsburgh is located in southwest Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[5] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[6] Pittsburgh is known both as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry, and as the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[7] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[8] Deindustrialization in the 1970s and 1980s laid off area blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, and thousands of downtown white-collar workers also lost jobs when several Pittsburgh-based companies moved out.[9]\n\n\nAfter 1990, Pittsburgh transformed into a hub for the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[10] Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Allegheny Health Network, and 68 colleges and universities, including research and development leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[11] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research and the nuclear navy.[12] In the private sector, Pittsburgh-based PNC is the nation's fifth-largest bank, and the city is home to eight Fortune 500 companies, and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. RAND Corporation, BNY Mellon, Nova, FedEx, Bayer, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have regional headquarters and offices that helped Pittsburgh become the sixth-best area for U.S. job growth.[13] Furthermore, the region is a hub for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and energy extraction.[14]\n\n\nPittsburgh's rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[15] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /ˈpɪtsbərə/ *PITS-bər-ə* (similar to Edinburgh).[16][17]\n\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[18]\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[19]\n\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final *h* was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[20][16] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the *h* was reversed.[16] The *Pittsburg Press* continued spelling the city without an *h* until 1921.[21]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Pittsburgh and Name of Pittsburgh\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Pittsburgh.\n\nHistorical claims\n\n\n> \n> French Empire 1669–1758  \n> British Empire 1681–1781  \n> United States 1776–present\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n### Native Americans[edit]\n\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[22] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[23]: 289\n\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution\n\n![](image)Fort Pitt Block House, built by the British in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in Pittsburgh.\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[24][*better source needed*] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[25]\n\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[25] During 1753–1754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[26] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[27]\n\n\nDuring Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[28][29][30][31]\n\n\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[32] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier.\n\n\nOn April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[33][34] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[35]\n\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Viceroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\n![A historic 1857 scene of the Monongahela River in downtown Pittsburgh featuring a steamboat](image)The Monongahela River and its surroundings in 1857\n![](image)Lithograph of Pittsburgh by Otto Krebs (before 1874)\n![](image)Burning of Union Depot during the Pittsburgh railroad strike of 1877\nThe federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition.[36] Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River.[37]\n\n\nThe War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats, that increased trading traffic on the rivers.\n\n\nIn the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, the most came from Germany.\n\n\nBecause Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[38] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[39] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[38]\n\n\nThe American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![Bird's Eye View of Pittsburgh, 1902](image)An aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902[40]\n![](image)Steel mills in the Strip District in 1906\nIn 1901, J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.\n\n\nThe Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk, concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia.[41]\n\n\nThe city suffered severe flooding in March 1936.\n\n\nThe city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[42] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[43] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[44]\n\n\nDuring World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.[27] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"[45][46] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"[47]\n\n\nFollowing World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[9]\n\n\nIn the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nDuring the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.[48]\n\n\nIn September 2009, the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh.[49]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Regional identity\n\n![](image)Downtown Pittsburgh and the Duquesne Incline from Mount Washington\nPittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), or 4.75%, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown.\n\n\nThe city is on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau.[50] The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River. The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as \"the Point.\" The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential.\n\n\nMany Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to \"hills,\" \"heights,\" or similar features.[a]\n\n\nThe steps of Pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.[51] Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.[52]\n\n\nBike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n#### Areas[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Pittsburgh neighborhoods, List of tallest buildings in Pittsburgh, List of City of Pittsburgh historic designations, and List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks\n\n![](image)Pittsburgh's 90 distinct neighborhoods\nThe city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,[53] and four main areas surrounding it. These surrounding areas are subdivided into distinct neighborhoods (Pittsburgh has 90 neighborhoods).[54] Relative to downtown, these areas are known as the Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End.\n\n\n\n##### Golden Triangle[edit]\n\n\nDowntown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine of which top 500 feet (150 m). The U.S. Steel Tower is the tallest, at 841 ft (256 m).[55] The Cultural District consists of a 14-block area of downtown along the Allegheny River. This district contains many theaters and arts venues and is home to a growing residential segment. Most significantly, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is embarking on RiverParc, a four-block mixed-use \"green\" community, featuring 700 residential units and multiple towers of between 20 and 30 stories. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. New condo towers have been constructed and historic office towers are converted to residential use, increasing 24-hour residents. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south.[56] It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown.\n\n\n\n##### North Side[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: North Side (Pittsburgh)\n\n![](image)Townhouses in the Mexican War Streets neighborhood\nThe North Side is home to various neighborhoods in transition. What is known today as Pittsburgh's North Side was once known as Allegheny City, and operated as a city independently of Pittsburgh until it was merged with Pittsburgh in 1907 under great protest from its citizens. The North Side is primarily composed of residential neighborhoods and is noteworthy for its well-constructed and architecturally interesting homes. Many buildings date from the 19th century and are constructed of brick or stone and adorned with decorative woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs and stained glass. The North Side is also home to attractions such as Acrisure Stadium, PNC Park, Carnegie Science Center, National Aviary, Andy Warhol Museum, Mattress Factory art museum, Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, Randyland, Penn Brewery, Allegheny Observatory, and Allegheny General Hospital.[57]\n\n\n\n##### South Side[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: South Side (Pittsburgh)\n\n![](image)East Carson Street in the South Side Flats\nThe South Side was once the site of railyards and associated dense, inexpensive housing for mill and railroad workers. Since the late 20th century, the city undertook a Main Street program in cooperation with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, encouraging design and landscape improvements on East Carson Street, and supporting new retail. The area has become a local Pittsburgher destination, and the value of homes in the South Side had increased in value by about 10% annually for the 10 years up to 2014.[58] East Carson Street has developed as one of the most vibrant areas of the city, packed with diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, vibrant nightlife, and live music venues.\n\n\nIn 1993 the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property. It collaborated with the community and various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development, to include a riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care facilities, and indoor practice fields for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pitt Panthers. Construction began in 1998. The SouthSide Works has been open since 2005, featuring many stores, restaurants, offices, and the world headquarters for American Eagle Outfitters.[59]\n\n\n\n##### East End[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shadyside neighborhood\nThe East End of Pittsburgh is home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University, Chatham University, The Carnegie Institute's Museums of Art and Natural History, Phipps Conservatory, and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall. It is also home to many parks and public spaces including Mellon Park, Westinghouse Park, Schenley Park, Frick Park, The Frick Pittsburgh, Bakery Square, and the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. The neighborhoods of Shadyside and Squirrel Hill are large, wealthy neighborhoods with some apartments and condos, and pedestrian-oriented shopping/business districts. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues.[60] Oakland, heavily populated by undergraduate and graduate students, is home to most of the universities, and the Petersen Events Center. The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. The Hill District was home to photographer Charles Harris as well as various African-American jazz clubs.[61] Other East End neighborhoods include Point Breeze, Regent Square, Highland Park, Homewood, Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar, Larimer, East Hills, East Liberty, Polish Hill, Hazelwood, Garfield, Morningside, and Stanton Heights.\n\n\n\n##### West End[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: West End (Pittsburgh) § Region\n\nThe West End includes Mt. Washington, with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such as Sheraden and Elliott.\n\n\n\n#### Ethnicities[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Pittsburgh is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area, a Combined statistical area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\nPittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the \"northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia.\"[64] In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the \"Paris of Appalachia\",[65][66][67][68] recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 2.6\n\n\n\n36\n\n21\n | 2.4\n\n\n\n39\n\n23\n | 3\n\n\n\n49\n\n30\n | 3.1\n\n\n\n62\n\n40\n | 4\n\n\n\n71\n\n49\n | 4.3\n\n\n\n79\n\n58\n | 3.8\n\n\n\n83\n\n63\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n81\n\n62\n | 3.1\n\n\n\n74\n\n54\n | 2.3\n\n\n\n63\n\n43\n | 3.2\n\n\n\n51\n\n35\n | 2.9\n\n\n\n39\n\n25\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Metric conversion |\n| --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 66\n\n\n\n2\n\n−6\n | 61\n\n\n\n4\n\n−5\n | 75\n\n\n\n10\n\n−1\n | 79\n\n\n\n17\n\n5\n | 100\n\n\n\n22\n\n10\n | 109\n\n\n\n26\n\n15\n | 97\n\n\n\n28\n\n17\n | 88\n\n\n\n27\n\n16\n | 79\n\n\n\n24\n\n12\n | 58\n\n\n\n17\n\n6\n | 82\n\n\n\n11\n\n2\n | 72\n\n\n\n4\n\n−4\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S.[69][70][71] The city and river valleys lie in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b while higher elevated areas and some suburbs lie in zone 6a.[72] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season.[73]\n\n\nThe warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year,[74] a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °F (−1.8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.[74] Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901.[74][b] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.[74]\n\n\nAverage annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018.[75] On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51.[76] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.[77] In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%).\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh International Airport), 1991–2020 normals,[c] extremes 1874–present[d] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 75(24)\n | 78(26)\n | 84(29)\n | 90(32)\n | 95(35)\n | 98(37)\n | 103(39)\n | 103(39)\n | 102(39)\n | 91(33)\n | 82(28)\n | 74(23)\n | 103(39)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 61.5(16.4)\n | 63.2(17.3)\n | 73.5(23.1)\n | 81.5(27.5)\n | 86.8(30.4)\n | 90.4(32.4)\n | 91.3(32.9)\n | 90.3(32.4)\n | 88.2(31.2)\n | 79.9(26.6)\n | 70.8(21.6)\n | 62.6(17.0)\n | 92.6(33.7)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 36.3(2.4)\n | 39.6(4.2)\n | 49.1(9.5)\n | 62.4(16.9)\n | 71.9(22.2)\n | 79.4(26.3)\n | 82.9(28.3)\n | 81.7(27.6)\n | 75.1(23.9)\n | 63.1(17.3)\n | 50.9(10.5)\n | 40.6(4.8)\n | 61.1(16.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 28.8(−1.8)\n | 31.4(−0.3)\n | 39.7(4.3)\n | 51.5(10.8)\n | 61.2(16.2)\n | 69.4(20.8)\n | 73.2(22.9)\n | 71.8(22.1)\n | 64.9(18.3)\n | 53.4(11.9)\n | 42.6(5.9)\n | 33.7(0.9)\n | 51.8(11.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 21.4(−5.9)\n | 23.2(−4.9)\n | 30.3(−0.9)\n | 40.7(4.8)\n | 50.6(10.3)\n | 59.3(15.2)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n | 62.0(16.7)\n | 54.8(12.7)\n | 43.7(6.5)\n | 34.3(1.3)\n | 26.7(−2.9)\n | 42.5(5.8)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 1.0(−17.2)\n | 5.0(−15.0)\n | 11.7(−11.3)\n | 25.4(−3.7)\n | 35.6(2.0)\n | 45.2(7.3)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 51.1(10.6)\n | 41.2(5.1)\n | 29.5(−1.4)\n | 19.3(−7.1)\n | 9.7(−12.4)\n | −1.5(−18.6)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −22(−30)\n | −20(−29)\n | −5(−21)\n | 11(−12)\n | 26(−3)\n | 34(1)\n | 42(6)\n | 39(4)\n | 31(−1)\n | 16(−9)\n | −1(−18)\n | −12(−24)\n | −22(−30)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 2.96(75)\n | 2.62(67)\n | 3.15(80)\n | 3.32(84)\n | 3.83(97)\n | 4.12(105)\n | 4.26(108)\n | 3.52(89)\n | 3.30(84)\n | 2.83(72)\n | 2.86(73)\n | 2.84(72)\n | 39.61(1,006)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 13.3(34)\n | 11.7(30)\n | 7.6(19)\n | 1.0(2.5)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.4(1.0)\n | 2.4(6.1)\n | 7.7(20)\n | 44.1(112)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 16.8\n | 13.9\n | 14.0\n | 13.9\n | 13.5\n | 12.4\n | 11.2\n | 10.5\n | 9.8\n | 11.1\n | 12.0\n | 14.6\n | 153.7\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 12.2\n | 9.3\n | 5.9\n | 1.6\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.3\n | 3.3\n | 7.6\n | 40.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 69.9\n | 67.3\n | 64.1\n | 59.8\n | 63.4\n | 66.2\n | 68.8\n | 71.2\n | 72.0\n | 68.3\n | 70.2\n | 71.9\n | 67.8\n |\n| Average dew point °F (°C)\n | 17.2(−8.2)\n | 18.9(−7.3)\n | 26.8(−2.9)\n | 34.5(1.4)\n | 45.9(7.7)\n | 55.2(12.9)\n | 60.1(15.6)\n | 59.5(15.3)\n | 53.4(11.9)\n | 40.8(4.9)\n | 32.4(0.2)\n | 23.2(−4.9)\n | 39.0(3.9)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 93.9\n | 108.5\n | 155.4\n | 182.8\n | 217.4\n | 242.2\n | 254.9\n | 228.4\n | 196.7\n | 167.3\n | 99.4\n | 74.4\n | 2,021.3\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 31\n | 36\n | 42\n | 46\n | 49\n | 54\n | 56\n | 54\n | 53\n | 48\n | 33\n | 26\n | 45\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | 6\n | 6\n | 6\n | 5\n | 4\n | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 4\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA (relative humidity, dew point and sun 1961–1990)[74][78][73][79] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[80] |\n\n#### Air quality[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, the \"State of the Air\" report from the American Lung Association (ALA) found that air quality in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV metro area worsened, not only for ozone (smog), but also for the second year in a row for both the daily and long-term measures of fine particle pollution. Outside of California, Allegheny County is the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.[81]\n\n\nIn a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the American Lung Association ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas.[82][83] The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works, the nation's largest coke mill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey.[84] The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia.[85]\n\n\nAlthough the county was still below the \"pass\" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.[86] ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated \"It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ... We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years, or more.\"[87]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched. As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities.[88]\n\n\nThe city contains 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets, by the last count conducted in 2005. A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh's tree cover, which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city, showed a value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits based on the urban forest contributions to aesthetics, energy use and air quality. Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Water quality[edit]\n\n\nThe local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits.[90] This is caused by frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has a combined sewer system, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959.[91] Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water.[92] As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers.[93] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[94] The local sewage authority, Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from the EPA to come up with solutions.[95] In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2 billion upgrade to the system which is moving closer to EPA approval.[96]\n\n\nPittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement.[97] In 2017, Mayor William Peduto advocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority.[98] Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).[97]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1800 | 1,565 |  | — |\n| 1810 | 4,768 |  | 204.7% |\n| 1820 | 7,248 |  | 52.0% |\n| 1830 | 12,568 |  | 73.4% |\n| 1840 | 21,115 |  | 68.0% |\n| 1850 | 46,601 |  | 120.7% |\n| 1860 | 49,221 |  | 5.6% |\n| 1870 | 86,076 |  | 74.9% |\n| 1880 | 156,389 |  | 81.7% |\n| 1890 | 238,617 |  | 52.6% |\n| 1900 | 321,616 |  | 34.8% |\n| 1910 | 533,905 |  | 66.0% |\n| 1920 | 588,343 |  | 10.2% |\n| 1930 | 669,817 |  | 13.8% |\n| 1940 | 671,659 |  | 0.3% |\n| 1950 | 676,806 |  | 0.8% |\n| 1960 | 604,332 |  | −10.7% |\n| 1970 | 520,117 |  | −13.9% |\n| 1980 | 423,938 |  | −18.5% |\n| 1990 | 369,879 |  | −12.8% |\n| 2000 | 334,563 |  | −9.5% |\n| 2010 | 305,704 |  | −8.6% |\n| 2020 | 302,971 |  | −0.9% |\n| 2022 (est.) | 302,898 |  | 0.0% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[99][100][2] |\n\n\nAt the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race.

The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance, education, and services. Annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion in 2007,[119] and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies.[120] A National Bureau of Economic Research 2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobility[121] or the American Dream.[122] Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been renovated as modern office space. Google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 1918–1998 Nabisco factory, a complex known as Bakery Square.[123] Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots.[124] Pittsburgh's transition from its industrial heritage has earned it praise as \"the poster child for managing industrial transition\".[125] Other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh's model in order to renew their industries and economic base.[126]\n\n\nThe largest employer in the city is the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, with 48,000 employees. All hospitals, outpatient clinics, and doctor's office positions combine for 116,000 jobs, approximately 10% of the jobs in the region. An analyst recently observed of the city's medical sector: \"That's both more jobs and a higher share of the region's total employment than the steel industry represented in the 1970s.\"[127]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Top publicly traded companiesin the Pittsburgh region for 2022**(ranked by revenues)*with metropolitan and U.S. ranks* |\n| **Metro** |  | **corporation** |  | **US** |  |\n| 1 |  | The Kraft Heinz Company |  | 139\n |  |\n| 2 |  | U.S. Steel |  | 172\n |  |\n| 3 |  | PNC Financial Services |  | 178\n |  |\n| 4 |  | Viatris |  | 204\n |  |\n| 5 |  | PPG Industries |  | 218\n |  |\n| 6 |  | Dick's Sporting Goods |  | 307\n |  |\n| 7 |  | Alcoa |  | 312\n |  |\n| 8 |  | WESCO International |  | 357\n |  |\n| 9 |  | Wabtec |  | 439\n |  |\n| 10 |  | Arconic |  | 452\n |  |\n|  |\n\n Education is a major economic driver in the region.

Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, David McCullough was born and raised in Pittsburgh.[159] Annie Dillard, a Pulitzer Prize–winning writer, was born and raised in Pittsburgh. Much of her memoir *An American Childhood* takes place in post-World War II Pittsburgh. Award-winning author John Edgar Wideman grew up in Pittsburgh and has based several of his books, including the memoir *Brothers and Keepers*, in his hometown. Poet Terrance Hayes, winner of the 2010 National Book Award and a 2014 MacArthur Foundation Fellow, received his MFA from the University of Pittsburgh, where he is a faculty member. Poet Michael Simms, founder of Autumn House Press, resides in the Mount Washington neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Poet Samuel John Hazo, the first poet Laureate of Pennsylvania, resides in the city. New writers include Chris Kuzneski, who attended the University of Pittsburgh and mentions Pittsburgh in his works, and Pittsburgher Brian Celio, author of *Catapult Soul*, who captured the Pittsburgh 'Yinzer' dialect in his writing. Pittsburgh's unique literary style extends to playwrights,[160] as well as local graffiti and hip hop artists.\n\n\nPittsburgh's position as the birthplace for community owned television and networked commercial television helped spawn the modern children's show genres exemplified by *Mister Rogers' Neighborhood*, *Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?*, *Happy's Party*, *Cappelli & Company*, and *The Children's Corner*, all nationally broadcast.\n\n\nThe *Pittsburgh Dad* series has showcased the Pittsburghese genre to a global YouTube audience since 2011.\n\n\nThe modern fantasy, macabre and science fiction genre was popularized by director George A. Romero, television's Bill Cardille and his *Chiller Theatre*,[161] director and writer Rusty Cundieff and makeup effects guru Tom Savini.[162] The genre continues today with the PARSEC science fiction organization,[163] The It's Alive Show, the annual \"Zombie Fest\",[164] and several writer's workshops including Write or Die,[165] Pittsburgh SouthWrites,[166] and Pittsburgh Worldwrights[167][168] with Barton Paul Levenson, Kenneth Chiacchia and Elizabeth Humphreys Penrose.\n\n\n\n### Food[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Primanti Bros. sandwich\nPittsburgh is known for several specialties including pierogies, kielbasa, chipped chopped ham sandwiches, and Klondike bars.[169][170] In 2019, Pittsburgh was deemed \"Food City of the Year\" by the San Francisco-based restaurant and hospitality consulting firm af&co.[171] Many restaurants were favorably mentioned, among them were Superior Motors in Braddock, Driftwood Oven in Lawrenceville, Spork in Bloomfield, Fish nor Fowl in Garfield, Bitter Ends Garden & Luncheonette in Bloomfield, and Rolling Pepperoni in Lawrenceville.[172]\n\n\nPittsburgh is home to the annual pickle-themed festival Picklesburgh, which has been named the \"best specialty food festival in America\".[173]\n\n\n\n### Local dialect[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Western Pennsylvania English\n\nThe Pittsburgh English dialect, commonly called *Pittsburghese*, was influenced by Scots-Irish, German, and Eastern European immigrants and African Americans.[174] Locals who speak the dialect are sometimes referred to as \"Yinzers\" (from the local word \"yinz\" [var. *yunz*], a blended form of \"you ones\", similar to \"y'all\" and \"you all\" in the South). Common Pittsburghese terms are: \"slippy\" (slippery), \"redd up\" (clean up), \"jagger bush\" (thorn bush), and \"gum bands\" (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb \"to be\". In Pittsburghese one would say \"the car needs washed\" instead of \"needs to be washed\", \"needs washing\", or \"needs a wash.\" The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore, but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted *The New York Times* to describe Pittsburgh as \"the Galapagos Islands of American dialect\".[175] The lexicon itself contains notable loans from Polish and other European languages; examples include *babushka*, *pierogi*, and *halušky*.[176]\n\n\n\n### Livability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Frick Environmental Center at Frick Park\nPittsburgh has five city parks and several parks managed by the Nature Conservancy. The largest, Frick Park, provides 664 acres (269 ha) of woodland park with extensive hiking and biking trails throughout steep valleys and wooded slopes. Birding enthusiasts visit the Clayton Hill area of Frick Park, where over 100 species of birds have been recorded.[177]\n\n\nResidents living in extremely low-lying areas near the rivers or one of the 1,400 creeks and streams may have occasional floods,[178] such as those caused when the remnants of Hurricane Ivan hit rainfall records in 2004.[179] River flooding is relatively rare due to federal flood control efforts extensively managing locks, dams, and reservoirs.[178][180][181] Residents living near smaller tributary streams are less protected from occasional flooding. The cost of a comprehensive flood control program for the region has been estimated at a prohibitive $50 billion.[178]\n\n\nPittsburgh has the greatest number of bars per capita in the nation.[15]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Pittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh hosted the first professional football game and the first World Series. In 2009, Pittsburgh won the *Sporting News* title of \"Best Sports City\" in the United States[182] and, in 2013, *Sperling's Best Places* \"top 15 cities for baseball\".[183] College sports also have large followings with the University of Pittsburgh in football and sharing Division I basketball fans with Robert Morris and Duquesne.\n\n\nPittsburgh has a long history with its major professional sports teams—the Steelers of the National Football League, the Penguins of the National Hockey League, and the Pirates of Major League Baseball—which all share the same team colors, the official city colors of black and gold.[f] Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States where this practice of sharing team colors in solidarity takes place.[184] The black-and-gold color scheme has since become widely associated with the city and personified in its famous Terrible Towel.[185]\n\n\nThe Pittsburgh Riverhounds are a professional soccer team who have been playing in Pittsburgh since they were established in 1999. They are a member of the USL Championship division, a second-tier league of US professional soccer and are in the league's Eastern Conference. The Riverhounds play their home matches at Highmark Stadium (Pennsylvania) a 5,000 seat soccer-specific stadium located in Pittsburgh's Station Square. In keeping with the uniformity of professional sports teams in Pittsburgh, the Riverhounds colors are black and gold.\n\n\n\"Rails to Trails\", has converted miles of former rail tracks to recreational trails, including a Pittsburgh-Washington D.C. bike/walking trail.[186] Several mountain biking trails are within the city and suburbs, Frick Park has biking trails and Hartwood Acres Park has many miles of single track trails.[187][188]\n\n\n\n### Professional[edit]\n\n\n**Major league**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Founded\n | League\n | Sport\n | Venue\n | Championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pittsburgh Pirates | 1882\n | Major League Baseball (MLB)\n | Baseball | PNC Park | 7[o 1] |\n| Pittsburgh Steelers | 1933\n | National Football League (NFL)\n | Football | Acrisure Stadium | 6[o 2] |\n| Pittsburgh Penguins | 1967\n | National Hockey League (NHL)\n | Hockey | PPG Paints Arena | 5[o 3] |\n\n\n**Minor league/other**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Founded\n | League\n | Sport\n | Venue\n | Championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pittsburgh Riverhounds | 1999\n | USL Championship (USLC)\n | Soccer\n | Highmark Stadium |  |\n| Steel City Yellow Jackets | 2014\n | ABA | Basketball | CCAC Allegheny Arena | 1\n |\n\n\n1. **^** The Pirates won championships in 1901, 1902, 1909, 1925, 1960, 1971, and 1979. 1901 and 1902 were Pre World-Series Era Champions.\n2. **^** The Steelers won championships in 1974, 1975, 1978, 1979, 2005, and 2008.\n3. **^** The Penguins won championships in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017.\n\n\\*\\*Pittsburgh's ABA franchise won the 1968 title, but the Steel City Yellow Jackets franchise is heir to it only in location.\n\n\n\n### College[edit]\n\n\n**Power 5**\n\n\n\n\n\n| School\n | Prominent sports\n | Venues\n | Conference\n | National Championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| University of Pittsburgh | Pitt Football (FBS)\n | Acrisure Stadium | ACC | 9[o 1] |\n| Pitt Basketball | Petersen Events Center | 1927–28 1929–30 |\n\n\n**Other**\n\n\n\n\n\n| School\n | Prominent sports\n | Venues\n | Conference\n | National Championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Duquesne University | Dukes Football (FCS)\n | Art Rooney Field | NEC | 1941, 1973, 2003 |\n| Dukes Basketball | UPMC Cooper Fieldhouse | A10 | 1954–55 (NIT)\n |\n| Robert Morris University | Colonials Basketball | UPMC Events Center | NEC |  |\n| Colonials Hockey | Island Sports Center | AHA |  |\n\n\n1. **^** The Panthers won championships in 1915, 1916, 1918, 1929, 1931, 1934, 1936, 1937, and 1976.\n\n### Baseball[edit]\n\n\n![](image)PNC Park, home stadium of the Pittsburgh Pirates\n> \n> [t]his is the perfect blend of location, history, design, comfort and baseball ...

The Pirates are nine-time Pennant winners and five-time World Series Champions, were in the first World Series (1903) and claim two pre-World Series titles in 1901 and 1902. The Pirates play in PNC Park.\n\n\nPittsburgh also has a rich Negro league history, with the former Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays credited with as many as 14 league titles and 11 Hall of Famers between them in the 1930s and 1940s, while the Keystones fielded teams in the 1920s. In addition, in 1971 the Pirates were the first Major League team to field an all-minority lineup. One sportswriter claimed, \"No city is more synonymous with black baseball than Pittsburgh.\"[189]\n\n\nSince the late 20th century, the Pirates had three consecutive National League Championship Series appearances (1990–92) (going 6, 7 and 7 games each), followed by setting the MLB record for most consecutive losing seasons, with 20 from 1993 until 2012. This era was followed by three consecutive postseason appearances: the 2013 National League Division Series and the 2014–2015 Wild Card games. Their September pennant race in 1997 featured the franchises' last no-hitter and last award for Sporting News' Executive of the Year.[190]\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: American football in Western Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

News of the team has preempted news of elections and other events, and are important to the region and its diaspora. The Steelers have been owned by the Rooney family since the team's founding in 1933, show consistency in coaching (only three coaches since the 1960s all with the same basic philosophy) and are noted as one of sports' most respectable franchises.[191] The Steelers have a long waiting list for season tickets, and have sold out every home game since 1972.[192] The team won four Super Bowls in a six-year span in the 1970s, a fifth Super Bowl in 2006, and a league record sixth Super Bowl in 2009. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 they have qualified for the most NFL playoff berths (28) and have played in (15) and hosted (11) the most NFL conference championship games.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHigh school football routinely attract 10,000 fans per game and extensive press coverage.[*citation needed*] The Tom Cruise film All the Right Moves and ESPN's Bound for Glory with Dick Butkus both filmed in the area to capture the tradition and passion of local high school football.\n\n\nCollege football in the city dates to 1889 with the Division I (FBS) Panthers of the University of Pittsburgh posting nine national championships and qualifying 34 total bowl games and appearing in the 2018 ACC Championship Game. Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris have loyal fan bases that follow their lower (FCS) teams. Duquesne, Carnegie Mellon University, and Washington & Jefferson College all posted major bowl games and AP Poll rankings from the 1920s to the 1940s as that era's equivalent of Top 25 FBS programs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAcrisure Stadium serves as home for the Steelers, Panthers, and both the suburban and city high school championships. Playoff franchises Pittsburgh Power and Pittsburgh Gladiators competed in the Arena Football League in the 1980s and 2010s respectively. The Gladiators hosted ArenaBowl I in the city, competing in two, but losing both before moving to Tampa, Florida and becoming the Storm.[193] The Pittsburgh Passion has been the city's professional women's football team since 2002 and plays its home games at Highmark Stadium. The Ed Debartolo owned Pittsburgh Maulers featured a Heisman Trophy winner in the mid-1980s, former superstar University of Nebraska running back Mike Rozier.\n\n\n\n### Hockey[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The team has won 6 Eastern Conference titles (1991, 1992, 2008, 2009, 2016 and 2017) and 5 Stanley Cup championships (1991, 1992, 2009, 2016 and 2017). Since 1999, Hall of Famer and back-to-back playoff MVP Mario Lemieux has served as Penguins owner. Until moving into the PPG Paints Arena in 2010 (when it was known as Consol Energy Center), the team played their home games at the world's first retractable domed stadium, the Civic Arena, or in local parlance \"The Igloo\".[194]\n\n\nIce hockey has had a regional fan base since the 1890s semi-pro Keystones. The city's first ice rink dates back to 1889, when there was an ice rink at the Casino in Schenley Park. From 1896 to 1956, the Exposition Building on the Allegheny River near The Point and Duquesne Gardens in Oakland offered indoor skating.[195]\n\n\nThe NHL awarded one of its first franchises to the city in 1924 on the strength of the back-to-back USAHA championship winning Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets featuring future Hall of Famers and a Stanley Cup winning coach. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates made several Stanley Cup playoff runs with a future Hall of Famer before folding from Great Depression financial pressures. Hockey survived with the Pittsburgh Hornets farm team (1936–1967) and their seven finals appearances and three championships in 18 playoff seasons.\n\n\nRobert Morris University fields a Division I college hockey team at the Island Sports Center. Pittsburgh has semi-pro and amateur teams such as the Pittsburgh Penguins Elite.[196] Pro-grade ice rinks such as the Rostraver Ice Garden, Mt. Lebanon Recreation Center and Iceoplex at Southpointe have trained several native Pittsburgh players for NHL play. RMU hosted the city's first Frozen Four college championship in 2013 with the four PPG Paints Arena games televised by ESPN.\n\n\n\n### Basketball[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Pitt Panthers men's basketball game at the Petersen Events Center in 2009\nProfessional basketball in Pittsburgh dates to the 1910s with teams \"Monticello\" and \"Loendi\" winning five national titles, the Pirates (1937–45 in the NBL), the Pittsburgh Ironmen (1947–48 NBA inaugural season), the Pittsburgh Rens (1961–63), the Pittsburgh Pipers (first American Basketball Association championship in 1968) led by Connie Hawkins (team then moved); the Pittsburgh Condors (ABA returned in 1970–72), the Pittsburgh Piranhas (CBA Finals in 1995), the Pittsburgh Xplosion (2004–08) and Phantoms (2009–10) both of the ABA. The city has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular season \"neutral site\" NBA games, including Wilt Chamberlain's record setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand.[197]\n\n\nThe Duquesne University Dukes and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers have played college basketball in the city since 1914 and 1905 respectively. Pitt and Duquesne have played the annual City Game since 1932.\nDuquesne was the city's first team to appear in a Final Four (1940), obtain a number one AP Poll ranking (1954),[198] and to win a post-season national title, the 1955 National Invitation Tournament on its second straight trip to the NIT title game. Duquesne is the only college program to produce back-to-back NBA No. 1 overall draft picks with 1955's Dick Ricketts and 1956's Sihugo Green.[199] Duquesne's Chuck Cooper was the first African American drafted by an NBA team.[200]\n\n\nThe Panthers won two pre-tournament era Helms Athletic Foundation National Championships in 1928 and 1930, competed in a \"national title game\" against LSU in 1935, and made a Final Four appearance in 1941. Pitt has won 13 conference titles, qualified for the NCAA tournament 26 times including a post season tournament every season between 1999 and 2000 and 2015–2016 during which time it regularly sold out the Petersen Events Center. The program has produced 27 NBA draft picks and 15 All Americans while ranking No. 1 in the nation as recently as 2009.\n\n\nThe suburban Robert Morris University's Colonials have competed in NCAA Division I basketball since the 1970s, qualifying for the NCAA tournament in each of the last four decades (8). In the 2013 National Invitation Tournament the Colonials notched an upset win over the defending national champions Kentucky Wildcats.\n\n\nPittsburgh Panthers women's basketball has qualified for 14 post season tournaments (including 4 NCAA tournaments) and boasts of 5 All-Americans selected 6 times with 3 WNBA players. Pitt women began play in 1914 before being reintroduced in 1970. Both Duquesne and Robert Morris also have competitive Division I women's basketball programs.\n\n\nPittsburgh launched the nation's first high school all-star game in 1965.[201] The Roundball Classic annually featured future NBA hall of famers at the Civic Arena with ESPN televising. The Civic Arena also hosted the championship tournament for the Eastern Eight Conference from 1978 until 1982.\n\n\n\n### Soccer[edit]\n\n\nThe Riverhounds, an American professional soccer team, were founded in 1998. Like the major league teams in the city, the Riverhounds wear black and gold kits. The club plays in the Eastern Conference of the USL Championship, the second tier of the American soccer pyramid.

His successor, Bill Peduto, was sworn in on January 6, 2014. In November 2021, Pittsburgh elected its first African-American mayor, Ed Gainey.\n\n\nPrior to the American Civil War, Pittsburgh was strongly abolitionist. It is considered the birthplace of the national Republican Party,[203] as the party held its first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. The effects of the Great Depression, combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a shift among voters to the Democratic Party. With the exceptions of the 1973 and 1977 elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), Democrats have been elected consecutively to the mayor's office since the 1933 election. The city's ratio of party registration is 5 to 1 Democrat.[204]\n\n\nPittsburgh is represented in the Pennsylvania General Assembly by three Senate Districts (Lindsey Williams (D)-38, Wayne D. Fontana (D)-42, and Jay Costa (D)-43) and nine House Districts (Aerion Abney-19, Adam Ravenstahl-20, Sara Innamorato-21, Dan Frankel-23, Martell Covington-24, Dan Deasy-27, Summer Lee-34, and Harry Readshaw-36, Dan Miller-42).\n\n\nFederally, Pittsburgh is part of Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, represented by Democrat Summer Lee since 2023 and also by Democrat Chris Deluzio.\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Ford Taurus and a Chevrolet Impala belonging to the Pittsburgh Police\nThe area's largest law enforcement agency is the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, with close to 850 sworn officers.

Crimes of a federal nature are covered by the U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n### Crime[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh annually ranks as one of America's safest big cities, in 2013 being named the 3rd \"most secure\" big city by Farmers Insurance.[205] Among crime rates of the 60 largest U.S. cities, 43 had more instances of property crime while 16 had less when compared to Pittsburgh. More instances of violent crime were reported in 21 of the largest cities while 37 had less. The FBI recommends against using data for ranking.[206][207]\nPer 100,000 persons stats (2012):\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Murder | Rape | Robbery | Assault | Burglary | Theft | Motor vehicle | Total violent | Total property\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City | 13.1 | 15.1 | 363.3 | 360.4 | 812.8 | 2,438.2 | 174.3 | 752.0 | 3,425.4\n |\n\n\nAt the end of 2019, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police reported 37 murders in the city that year.[208]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n### Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of colleges and universities in Pittsburgh\n\n![](image)The Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh\n![](image)The main campus of Carnegie Mellon University\nPittsburgh is home to many colleges, universities and research facilities, the most well-known of which are Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne University.

The first was KDKA 1020 AM, also the world's first commercially licensed radio station, airing on November 2, 1920.[220] Other stations include KQV 1410 AM (news), WBGG 970 AM (sports), KDKA-FM 93.7 FM (sports), WKST-FM 96.1 FM (Top 40), WAMO-AM 660 AM and 107.3 FM (urban contemporary) WBZZ 100.7 FM (adult contemporary), WDVE 102.5 FM (album rock), WPGB 104.7 FM (Country), and WXDX 105.9 FM (modern rock). There are also three public radio stations in the area: WESA 90.5 FM (National Public Radio affiliate), WQED 89.3 FM (classical), and WYEP 91.3 FM (adult alternative). Three non-commercial stations are run by Carnegie Mellon University (WRCT 88.3 FM), the University of Pittsburgh (WPTS 92.1 FM), and Point Park University (WPPJ 670 AM).\n\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh's 116-year-old film industry accelerated after the 2006 passage of the Pennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit.[221] According to the Pittsburgh Film Office, over 124 major motion pictures have been filmed, in whole or in part, in Pittsburgh, including *The Mothman Prophecies*, *Wonder Boys*,[222] *Dogma*,[222] *Hoffa*, *The Silence of the Lambs*,[222] *Sudden Death*, *Flashdance*,[222] *Southpaw*, *Striking Distance*, *Mrs. Soffel*, *Jack Reacher*, *Inspector Gadget*, *The Next Three Days*, *The Perks of Being a Wallflower*,[222] *Zack and Miri Make a Porno*, and *Fences*.[222][223] Pittsburgh became \"Gotham City\" in 2011 during filming of *The Dark Knight Rises*.[133] George A. Romero shot nearly all his films in the area, including his *Living Dead* series.[224]\n\n\nFilm production in Pittsburgh has notably impacted the region's economy and job creation, largely due to the 25% tax credit incentive established in 2007.[225][226] The Pittsburgh Film Office states that the film and television industry provides employment to over 10,000 people and pays over $500 million in wages in southwestern Pennsylvania.[227] Furthermore, the industry supports over 345,000 local businesses and contributes over $41 billion to them.[226]\n\n\nFrom 2017 to 2023, Pittsburgh has welcomed a series of major film and television productions like *Fences*, *Mindhunter*, *Ma Rainey's Black Bottom*, *Sweet Girl*, and *I'm Your Woman*.[228] These productions have significantly contributed to the local economy by hiring local personnel, leasing local facilities and equipment, purchasing local goods and services, and enhancing local tourism and visibility.[229]\n\n\nIn addition to a thriving film industry, Pittsburgh is home to several film festivals, film schools, and organizations that encourage and promote independent and diverse filmmakers. Notable film festivals include the Three Rivers Film Festival, the Pittsburgh Shorts Film Festival, the JFilm Festival, the ReelAbilities Film Festival, and the Black Bottom Film Festival.[230][231] The local film schools include Pittsburgh Filmmakers, Point Park University - Cinema & Digital Arts, and University of Pittsburgh - Film Studies.[232][233]\n\n\nMoreover, Pittsburgh is developing a robust film studio infrastructure, with several sound stages and production facilities available for hire. Prominent film studios in Pittsburgh are 3 Rivers Studios, Cinelease Studios, Post Script Films, Deeplocal, and The Videohouse.[234][235][236][237][238] There are also plans in the pipeline to develop a new film studio complex at the Carrie Furnace site in Rankin and Swissvale.[239]\n\n\n\n## Utilities[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Allegheny County Sanitary Authority\n\nThe city is served by Duquesne Light, one of the original 1912 power companies founded by George Westinghouse.[240] Water service is provided by the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority[241] and Pennsylvania American Water. Natural gas is provided by Equitable Gas, Columbia Gas, Dominion Resources, Direct Energy, and Novec.[242]\n\n\n\n## Health care[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of hospitals in Pittsburgh\n\n![](image)UPMC's flagship, UPMC Presbyterian\n![](image)Allegheny General Hospital, the flagship of the Allegheny Health Network\nThe two largest area health care providers are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) (since 1893) and Allegheny Health Network (since 1882). Both hospitals annually rank as among the best overall in the United States, with UPMC ranked among *U.S. News & World Report*'s \"Honor Roll\" every year since 2000.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe first military hospital in U.S. history and the first west of the Atlantic Plain—General Edward Hand Hospital—served the area from 1777 to 1845.[243] Since 1847, Pittsburgh has hosted the world's first \"Mercy Hospital\".[244] This was followed by West Penn hospital in 1848, Passavant Hospital in 1849,[25] the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1883, Children's Hospital in 1887, and Magee Womens Hospital in 1911. In 1954, Allegheny General (AGH) was among the first to administer Cobalt therapy.[245]\n\n\nIn 1980, UPMC announced a $250 million ($1.05 billion today) expansion and also hired transplant pioneer Thomas Starzl.[246] In 1984, Allegheny General surgeons pioneered modern brain surgery. Starzl arranged the 1985 liver transplant of 5-year-old Amie Garrison as a UPMC surgery team flew to Baylor University, starting its transplant program.[247] Also in 1985, UPMC surgeons Drs. Griffith, Hardesty, and Trento revealed a new device after a heart-lung transplant. In 1986, UPMC announced a $230 million ($639 million today) modernization. In 1996, UPMC's planned Sicily ISMETT branch was approved by the Italian government as transplant surgeons to supervise and deliver the world's third (both earlier ones done at UPMC)--and first public—cross species marrow transplant at University of California, San Francisco.[248] UPMC's Thomas Detre founded the International Society for Bipolar Disorders at a world medical conference in Pittsburgh in 1999.[249]\n\n\nThe $80 million ($142 million today) UPMC Sports Performance Complex for the Pittsburgh Panthers & Pittsburgh Steelers opened in 2000. In 2002, AGH opened its $30 million ($51.6 million today), 5-floor, 100,000 sq. ft., cancer center. The $130 million ($220 million today) 350,000 sq. ft. Hillman Cancer Center opened in 2003 as UPMC entered into an 8-year, $420 million ($678 million today) agreement with IBM to upgrade medical technologies & health information systems.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2009, the $600 million ($849 million today) UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh opened. The campus was featured in world news in 2012 for several unique approaches to patient care.[250] UPMC officially adopted in Erie, Pennsylvania's Hamot Medical Center in 2010. The Pittsburgh Penguins announced a state of the art training facility with UPMC in 2012.[251] UPMC announced in 2013 it had partnered with Nazarbayev University to help found its medical school.[252]\n\n\n\n### Health discoveries[edit]\n\n\nWhile he was a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, American virologist Jonas Salk developed one of the first successful polio vaccines, which came into use in 1955.\n\n\nUPMC has pioneered several world firsts including the first known cystic fibrosis heart-lung transplant (1983), the world's first simultaneous liver and heart transplant operation on a child (6-year-old Stormie Jones in 1984), the youngest heart-lung transplant (9 years old in 1985), the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant (1989), the world's first heart-liver transplant on an infant (1997),[253] the first pediatric heart-double lung-liver transplant (1998), the nation's first double hand transplant (2009), and the first total forearm and hand transplant (2010), as well as the state's first heart transplant (1968).[254][255]\n\n\n*The Lancet* published a 2012 UPMC study of two 9-year quadriplegics being able to move a robotic arm by thought, to pick up objects, shake hands, and even eat. Wiring the brain around spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle function was successful using robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer to translate signals near a small group of neurons with 200 needles.[256]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Pittsburgh\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Pittsburgh's numerous bridges\nPittsburgh is a city of bridges. With 446,[257] it has three bridges more than Venice, Italy, which has historically held the title \"City of Bridges.\"[258] Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city. The Smithfield Street Bridge was the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The city's Three Sisters Bridges offer a picturesque view of the city from the North. The south-western \"entrance\" to Downtown for travelers coming in from Interstate 79 and the Pittsburgh International Airport is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Fort Duquesne Bridge carrying Interstate 279 is the main gateway from Downtown to both PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium and the Rivers Casino. The Panhandle Bridge carries Pittsburgh Regional Transit's Blue/Red/Silver subway lines across the Monongahela River. The renovated J&L Steel Company bridge has been a key traffic/running-biking trail conduit connecting the Southside Works and Pittsburgh Technology Center. Over 2,000 bridges span the landscape of Allegheny County.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Public transportation statistics[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh is served by Pittsburgh Regional Transit, the 26th-largest transit agency in the country prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Pittsburgh, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 73 min. 23% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 minutes, while 33% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 3.9 mi (6.3 km), while 11% travel for over 7.5 mi (12 km) in a single direction.[259]\n\n\n\n### Expressways and highways[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Expressways\n | Other Highways\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Parkway North | ![](image) | US 19 | ![](image) PA 88 |\n| ![](image)![](image) ![](image) | Parkway East & West | ![](image)![](image) | TruckUS 19 | ![](image) PA 121 |\n| ![](image) | Crosstown | ![](image) | PA 8 | ![](image) PA 130 |\n| ![](image) | Allegheny Valley Expressway | ![](image) | PA 50 | ![](image) PA 380 |\n| ![](image) | Ohio River Boulevard | ![](image) | PA 51 | ![](image) PA 837 |\n|   |   | ![](image) | PA 60 | ![](image) PA 885 |\n\n\n![](image)I-279\nLocals refer to the interstates fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the \"parkways.\" Interstate 376 is both the \"parkway east\" connecting to Interstate 76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) and the \"parkway west\" connecting to Interstate 79, the Pittsburgh International Airport, the Ohio end of the Turnpike and Interstate 80. The \"parkway north\" is Interstate 279 connecting to I-79. The \"crosstown\" is Interstate 579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the Liberty Tunnels and the PPG Paints Arena. The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long expressway sections of Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. Interstate 70, 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped \"beltway\" with Interstate 68 and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the Mon–Fayette Expressway, Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 66 also help traffic flow. The non-expressway Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System serves navigation in the region.\n\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Airports\n\nPittsburgh International Airport provides commercial passenger service from over 15 airlines to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Arnold Palmer Regional Airport also provides limited commercial passenger service and is 44 miles (71 km) east of Pittsburgh.\n\n\nOther airports that have or have had scheduled commercial service include Morgantown Municipal Airport (79 miles (127 km) south of Pittsburgh), Youngstown–Warren Regional Airport (81 miles (130 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Akron–Canton Airport (120 miles (190 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Johnstown–Cambria County Airport (60 miles (97 km) east of Pittsburgh) and Erie International Airport (123 miles (198 km) north of Pittsburgh).\n\n\n\n### Intercity passenger rail and bus[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Union Station (Pittsburgh) and Grant Street Transportation Center\n\nAmtrak provides intercity rail service to Pittsburgh Union Station, via the *Capitol Limited* between Chicago and Washington, D.C., and the *Pennsylvanian* to New York City.\n\n\nMegabus, Greyhound Lines, and Fullington Trailways connect Pittsburgh with distant cities by bus; Greyhound and Fullington Trailways buses stop at the Grant Street Transportation Center intercity bus terminal. Popular destinations include Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington, D.C.[260]\n\n\nUntil declines in passenger travel in the 1950s and 1960s, several stations served Pittsburgh: Baltimore & Ohio Station, Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station, Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal and Pittsburgh Union Station.\n\n\n\n### Regional mass transit[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Pittsburgh Light Rail and Port Authority of Allegheny County § Bus rapid transit\n\n![](image)Steel Plaza subway station\nPittsburgh Regional Transit, formerly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area, the nation's 20th-largest metropolitan area, it is the 11th-largest transit agency in the United States.[261] Pittsburgh Regional Transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline Funicular railway (more commonly known as an \"incline\") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems.[262] Pittsburgh Regional Transit owns the Duquesne Incline but it is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,[263] but accepts Pittsburgh Regional Transit passes and charges PRT fares.\n\n\nThe Bus System lines are labeled by number and letter. These are the largest portion of Pittsburgh Regional Transit and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as Pittsburgh International Airport, Monroeville, McCandless, and the borders of Westmoreland County and Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the \"T\") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, and Beechview, and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook.\n\n\n\n### Freight rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Union Station, built in 1903\nPittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the city and Philadelphia, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865 Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869.\n\n\nPittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard, built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S. also has major operations around Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\n### Port[edit]\n\n\nThe Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 20th-largest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011, the port ranked ninth-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[264]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Pittsburgh\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh's sister cities are:[265]\n\n\n\n* ![Spain](image) Bilbao, Spain\n* ![Vietnam](image) Da Nang, Vietnam\n* ![Paraguay](image) Fernando de la Mora, Paraguay\n* ![Turkey](image) Gaziantep, Turkey\n* ![Scotland](image) Glasgow, Scotland\n* ![Israel](image) Karmiel, Israel\n* ![Cuba](image) Matanzas, Cuba\n* ![Israel](image) Misgav, Israel\n* ![Mexico](image) Naucalpan, Mexico\n* ![Czech Republic](image) Ostrava, Czech Republic\n* ![Slovakia](image) Prešov, Slovakia\n* ![Germany](image) Saarbrücken, Germany\n* ![Japan](image) Saitama, Japan\n* ![Nicaragua](image) San Isidro, Nicaragua\n* ![England](image) Sheffield, England[g]\n* ![North Macedonia](image) Skopje, North Macedonia\n* ![Bulgaria](image) Sofia, Bulgaria\n* ![China](image) Wuhan, China\n* ![Croatia](image) Zagreb, Croatia\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n* Greater Pittsburgh Region\n* List of fiction set in Pittsburgh\n* List of municipalities in Pennsylvania\n* List of people from Pittsburgh\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The neighborhoods are Arlington Heights, Bluff, Brighton Heights, Crafton Heights, Duquesne Heights, East Hills, Fineview, Highland Park, Middle Hill, Mount Oliver, Mount Washington, Northview Heights, Perry North (also known as Observatory Hill), Perry South (also known as Perry Hilltop), Polish Hill, Ridgemont, South Side Slopes, Spring Hill-City View, Squirrel Hill, Stanton Heights, Summer Hill, Troy Hill, and Upper Hill.\n2. **^** The warmest daily minimum at the current observation location, Pittsburgh Int'l, is only 77 °F (25 °C) on July 23, 2010, and July 16, 1980.[74]\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n4. **^** Records kept September 1874 to June 1935 at the Weather Bureau Office across the Allegheny River from downtown, at Allegheny County Airport from July 1935 to 14 September 1952, and at Pittsburgh Int'l (KPIT) since 15 September 1952. Due to its river valley and urban location as well as elevation, many of the summertime warm minima temperature records set at the WBO have not even come close to being matched at KPIT, which is at-elevation and located in the western suburbs.

Erie is the fifth-largest city in Pennsylvania and the largest city in Northwestern Pennsylvania[3][4] with a population of 94,831 at the 2020 census.[3] The estimated population in 2023 had decreased to 92,732.[5] The Erie metropolitan area, equivalent to all of Erie County, consists of 266,096 residents. The Erie–Meadville combined statistical area had a population of 369,331 at the 2010 census.\n\n\nErie is located approximately 80 miles (130 km) from Buffalo, 90 miles (140 km) from Cleveland, and 120 miles (190 km) from Pittsburgh.[6] Erie's manufacturing sector remains prominent in the local economy, while insurance, healthcare, higher education, technology, service industries, and tourism are emerging as significant economic drivers. Like the other Great Lakes port cities, Erie is accessible to the oceans via the Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River network in Canada. The local climate is humid, four-seasonal, and snowy, with warm summers and harsh winters, owing to its southern lakeshore location.\n\n\nThe city was named for the Native American Erie people who lived in the area until the mid-17th century. Erie is nicknamed both the \"Gem City\", in reference to it once being known as the \"Gem of the Great Lakes\" due to its fine natural harbor; and more recently, the \"Flagship City\", from a local marketing effort to promote its status as the home port of Oliver Hazard Perry's flagship *Niagara*.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The Battle of Lake Erie in the War of 1812, a key historical event in Erie's history\nIndigenous peoples occupied the shoreline and bluffs in this area for thousands of years, taking advantage of the rich resources. Sommerheim Park Archaeological District in Millcreek Township west of the city, includes artifacts from the Archaic period in the Americas and the early and middle Woodland Period, roughly a span from 8,000 BCE to 500 CE.[8]\n\n\nEuropeans first arrived as settlers in the region when the French constructed Fort Presque Isle near present-day Erie in 1753, as part of their effort to defend New France against the encroaching British colonists. The name of the fort refers to the peninsula that juts into Lake Erie, now protected as Presque Isle State Park. The French term *presque-isle* means peninsula. When the French abandoned the fort in 1760 during the French and Indian War in the Seven Years' War, it was the last post they held west of Niagara River. The British established a garrison at the fort at Presque Isle that same year, three years before the end of the French and Indian War.[9]\n\n\nErie is in what was the disputed Erie Triangle, a tract of land comprising 202,187 acres in the northwest corner of Pennsylvania fronting Lake Erie that was claimed after the American Revolutionary War by the newly formed states of New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, as part of its Western Reserve, and Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution\n\nThe Iroquois claimed ownership of present-day Erie. On January 9. 1789, a conference was arranged during which representatives from the Iroquois signed a deed relinquishing their ownership of the land[10] in exchange for $2,000 from Pennsylvania and $1,200 from the federal government. Seneca Nation separately settled land claims against Pennsylvania in February 1791 for the sum of $800. It became a part of Pennsylvania on March 3, 1792, after Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York relinquished their rights to the land and sold the land to Pennsylvania for 75 cents per acre or a total of $151,640.25 in continental certificates.[11]\n\n\nThe General Assembly of Pennsylvania commissioned the surveying of land near Presque Isle through an act passed on April 18, 1795. Andrew Ellicott, who completed Pierre Charles L'Enfant's survey of Washington, D.C., and helped resolve the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York, arrived to begin the survey and lay out the plan for the city in June 1795. The initial settlement of the area began that year.[11][12] Lt. Colonel Seth Reed and his family moved to the Erie area from Geneva, New York; they were Yankees from Uxbridge, Massachusetts. They became the first European-American settlers of Erie in present-day Presque Isle.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Battle of Lake Erie and Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\nPresident James Madison began the construction of a naval fleet during the War of 1812 to gain control of the Great Lakes from the British. Daniel Dobbins of Erie and Noah Brown of Boston were notable shipbuilders who led the construction of four schooner−rigged gunboats and two brigs. Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry arrived from Rhode Island and led the squadron to success in the historic Battle of Lake Erie.[13]\n\n\nErie was an important shipbuilding, fishing, and railroad hub during the mid-19th century. The city was the site where three sets of track gauges met. While the delays engendered cargo troubles for commerce and travel, they provided much-needed local jobs in Erie. When a national standardized gauge was proposed, those jobs, and the importance of the rail hub itself, were put in jeopardy. In an event known as the Erie Gauge War, the citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up tracks, and rioted to try to stop the standardization.[14]\n\n\n\n### 20th and 21st centuries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)State and 9th Streets in downtown Erie during the early 1920s\nOn August 3, 1915, the Mill Creek flooded downtown Erie. A culvert, or a tunnel, was blocked by debris and collapsed.[15] A four-block reservoir, caused by torrential downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting deluge destroyed 225 houses and killed 36 people.[15] After the flood, Mayor Miles Brown Kitts had the Mill Creek directed into another, larger culvert, constructed under more than 2 miles of the city, before emptying into Presque Isle Bay on the city's lower east side.\n\n\nErie continued to grow for the first half of the 20th century, due to its strong manufacturing base. The city attracted numerous waves of European immigrants for industrial jobs. Erie was considered a wet city during the Prohibition Era in the United States. The city's economy began to suffer in the latter part of the 20th century as industrial restructuring took place and jobs moved out of the area. The Erie region is considered to be part of the Rust Belt. The importance of American manufacturing, US steel and coal production, and commercial fishing began to gradually decline,[16] resulting in a major population downturn in the 1970s.[16]\n\n\nWith the advent of the automobile age after World War II and government subsidies for highway construction, thousands of residents left Erie for suburbs such as Millcreek Township, which now has 55,000 residents.[16] This caused a decline in downtown retail businesses, some of which followed to the suburbs. Reflecting this perceived decline, Erie is occasionally referred to by residents as \"The Mistake on the Lake\" or \"Dreary Erie\".[17] Downtown Erie has undergone a resurgence in the early 2020s with the opening of Flagship City Food Hall and Flagship City Public Market.[18] [19]\n\n\nErie won the All-America City Award in 1972 and was a finalist in 1961, 1994, 1995, and 2009.[20][21] In 2012, Erie hosted the Perry 200,[22] a commemoration celebrating 200 years of peace between Britain, America, and Canada following the War of 1812 and Battle of Lake Erie.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of downtown Erie in 1912 looking West along the 15th Street tracks; the tallest steeple to the north of the tracks is St. Peter Cathedral.\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mill Creek passes through much of Erie, including the grounds of the Erie Zoo\nErie is situated in Northwestern Pennsylvania at 42°6′52″N 80°4′34″W﻿ / ﻿42.11444°N 80.07611°W﻿ / 42.11444; -80.07611 (42.114507, -80.076213),[23] on the southern shore of Lake Erie across from the Canadian province of Ontario. It is 100 miles (160 km) northeast of Cleveland, Ohio, 90 miles (140 km) southwest of Buffalo, New York, and 128 miles (206 km) north of Pittsburgh. Erie's bedrock is Devonian shale and siltstone, overlain by glacial tills and stratified drift. Stream drainage in the city flows northward into Lake Erie, then through Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence River, and out to the Atlantic Ocean. South of Erie is a drainage divide, beyond which most of the streams in western Pennsylvania flow south into the Allegheny or Ohio Rivers.[24] Lake Erie is about 571 ft (174 m) above sea level, while the city of Erie is about 728 ft (222 m) above sea level.\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 19.3 square miles (49.9 km2), with 19.1 square miles (49.4 km2) being land and the remaining 0.2 square miles (0.5 km2), or 1.03%, being water.[25] Presque Isle State Park (referred to by locals as \"the Peninsula\" or simply \"the beach\"), is a recurving sandspit peninsula that streches north into Lake Erie, providing a fine, natural harbor for Erie and offers 7 miles (11 km) of public beaches, wetlands, and fishing sites.\n\n\nErie fronts Presque Isle Bay and is laid out in a grid surrounding Perry Square in the downtown area.[26] The downtown area is separated from the waterfront by the Bayfront Parkway.[26] The tallest structure in Erie is St. Peter Cathedral at 265 ft (81 m), and the tallest building is Renaissance Centre at 198 ft (60 m). Historically, Erie had numerous ethnic neighborhoods, including Little Italy, which is located on Erie's west side, featuring the West 18th Street commercial corridor. South of 38th Street, the grid gives way to curvilinear roads of post-1970 suburban development. Millcreek Township and upper Peach Street in Summit Township include the Erie metropolitan area's newer developments.\n\n\nPost-industrial redevelopment of Erie's waterfront aimed at recreational and tourism uses include the Bayfront Parkway, Niagara Pier, Perry's Landing Marina, Liberty Park & Amphitheater, Bayfront Convention Center, hotels, and Dobbins Landing, which features the Bicentennial Tower at its northern end. On the east side of the bayfront, the Erie Maritime Museum and the Erie County main library (third-largest in Pennsylvania), host the USS *Niagara*. Docks and marinas fill the freshwater shoreline in between.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Erie falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. It is located in the snow belt that stretches from Cleveland to Syracuse and Watertown; winters are moderately cold, with heavy lake-effect snow, but also with occasional stretches of mild weather that cause accumulated snow to melt. The city experiences a full range of weather events, including snow, ice, rain, thunderstorms, and fog. The city's lakeside location helps to temper summer heat, with an average of 4 days with highs at or above 90 °F (32 °C) annually, and the highest temperature ever recorded was 100 °F (38 °C) on June 25, 1988. An average of 3 days have lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or colder annually, and the lowest temperature ever recorded was −18 °F (−28 °C) on January 19, 1994, and February 16, 2015.[27]\n\n\nErie is third on *The Daily Beast*'s list of snowiest places in the United States, averaging 78.7 inches (200 cm);[28] however, the 1981–2010 normal seasonal snowfall is 100.8 inches (256 cm). Average annual snowfall in the decade 2010-2019 was 100.7 inches (256 cm).[29] The adverse winter conditions caused USAir Flight 499 to overrun the runway at Erie International Airport on February 21, 1986, and caused whiteouts that were responsible for a 50-car pile-up on Interstate 90 on January 25, 2007.[30][31]\n\n\nThe coldest maximum temperature on record was −4 °F (−20 °C) in 1994 and the average coldest maximum between 1991 and 2020 was 13 °F (−11 °C).[27] The warmest overnight low on record was 82 °F (28 °C) once in 1918 and another time during the 1936 North American heat wave.[27] On average, the warmest low of the year is quite muggy 75 °F (24 °C).[27]\n\n\nOn December 24 and 25, 2017, Erie received 53 inches (135 cm) of snowfall, breaking a record for the largest two-day snowfall anywhere in Pennsylvania.[32][33] By the close of the 2017–2018 snow season, Erie had recorded 198.5 in (5.04 m) of snow, its snowiest season on record, breaking the previous record of 149.1 in (3.79 m) inches set in 2000–2001 by a large margin.[27]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Erie, Pennsylvania (Erie International Airport), 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1873–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 73(23)\n | 77(25)\n | 82(28)\n | 89(32)\n | 91(33)\n | 100(38)\n | 99(37)\n | 96(36)\n | 99(37)\n | 89(32)\n | 82(28)\n | 75(24)\n | 100(38)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 58.9(14.9)\n | 58.5(14.7)\n | 69.1(20.6)\n | 79.6(26.4)\n | 85.1(29.5)\n | 90.2(32.3)\n | 90.5(32.5)\n | 89.8(32.1)\n | 87.1(30.6)\n | 79.3(26.3)\n | 68.4(20.2)\n | 59.7(15.4)\n | 92.4(33.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 35.2(1.8)\n | 36.5(2.5)\n | 44.3(6.8)\n | 56.8(13.8)\n | 68.3(20.2)\n | 77.1(25.1)\n | 81.1(27.3)\n | 79.9(26.6)\n | 73.7(23.2)\n | 62.3(16.8)\n | 50.5(10.3)\n | 40.2(4.6)\n | 58.8(14.9)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 28.2(−2.1)\n | 28.9(−1.7)\n | 36.1(2.3)\n | 47.4(8.6)\n | 58.8(14.9)\n | 68.2(20.1)\n | 72.7(22.6)\n | 71.5(21.9)\n | 65.2(18.4)\n | 54.3(12.4)\n | 43.6(6.4)\n | 34.1(1.2)\n | 50.8(10.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 21.3(−5.9)\n | 21.4(−5.9)\n | 27.9(−2.3)\n | 38.0(3.3)\n | 49.3(9.6)\n | 59.4(15.2)\n | 64.2(17.9)\n | 63.2(17.3)\n | 56.7(13.7)\n | 46.3(7.9)\n | 36.7(2.6)\n | 28.0(−2.2)\n | 42.7(5.9)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 3.6(−15.8)\n | 4.1(−15.5)\n | 11.2(−11.6)\n | 25.7(−3.5)\n | 35.3(1.8)\n | 45.7(7.6)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 53.0(11.7)\n | 44.4(6.9)\n | 33.9(1.1)\n | 23.8(−4.6)\n | 13.3(−10.4)\n | 0.2(−17.7)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −18(−28)\n | −18(−28)\n | −9(−23)\n | 7(−14)\n | 26(−3)\n | 32(0)\n | 44(7)\n | 37(3)\n | 33(1)\n | 23(−5)\n | 6(−14)\n | −11(−24)\n | −18(−28)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 3.41(87)\n | 2.52(64)\n | 3.08(78)\n | 3.47(88)\n | 3.50(89)\n | 3.70(94)\n | 3.33(85)\n | 3.35(85)\n | 4.32(110)\n | 4.38(111)\n | 3.75(95)\n | 4.17(106)\n | 42.98(1,092)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 31.8(81)\n | 19.4(49)\n | 14.5(37)\n | 2.6(6.6)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 9.6(24)\n | 26.3(67)\n | 104.3(265)\n |\n| Average extreme snow depth inches (cm)\n | 9.9(25)\n | 9.1(23)\n | 7.3(19)\n | 1.7(4.3)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 4.8(12)\n | 7.6(19)\n | 13.8(35)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 19.7\n | 15.4\n | 14.3\n | 14.0\n | 13.5\n | 11.5\n | 10.5\n | 10.2\n | 10.1\n | 14.3\n | 14.9\n | 18.5\n | 166.9\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 16.3\n | 12.3\n | 7.8\n | 2.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.2\n | 4.8\n | 11.5\n | 55.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 74.5\n | 75.4\n | 71.9\n | 67.9\n | 68.9\n | 71.3\n | 71.7\n | 74.0\n | 74.5\n | 71.1\n | 72.3\n | 75.0\n | 72.4\n |\n| Source: NOAA (relative humidity 1961–1990)[27][34][35] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1800 | 81 |  | — |\n| 1810 | 394 |  | 386.4% |\n| 1820 | 635 |  | 61.2% |\n| 1830 | 1,465 |  | 130.7% |\n| 1840 | 3,412 |  | 132.9% |\n| 1850 | 5,858 |  | 71.7% |\n| 1860 | 9,419 |  | 60.8% |\n| 1870 | 19,646 |  | 108.6% |\n| 1880 | 27,737 |  | 41.2% |\n| 1890 | 40,634 |  | 46.5% |\n| 1900 | 52,733 |  | 29.8% |\n| 1910 | 66,525 |  | 26.2% |\n| 1920 | 93,372 |  | 40.4% |\n| 1930 | 115,967 |  | 24.2% |\n| 1940 | 116,955 |  | 0.9% |\n| 1950 | 130,803 |  | 11.8% |\n| 1960 | 138,440 |  | 5.8% |\n| 1970 | 129,231 |  | −6.7% |\n| 1980 | 119,123 |  | −7.8% |\n| 1990 | 108,718 |  | −8.7% |\n| 2000 | 103,717 |  | −4.6% |\n| 2010 | 101,786 |  | −1.9% |\n| 2020 | 94,831 |  | −6.8% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[36][2] |\n\n\nAs of the 2010 United States Census, 101,786 people,[37] 40,913 households, and 22,915 families were residing in the city.[38] Its 44,790 housing units averaged a vacancy rate of 8%. Erie has long been declining in population due to the departure of factories and dependent businesses.[39] The city has lost about 40,000 people since the early 1960s, allowing Allentown to claim the position as Pennsylvania's third-largest city behind Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographics of Erie compared on the state and national levels, as of 2010[update] Census\n|  | Erie\n | Pennsylvania\n | United States\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total population\n | 101,786\n | 12,702,379\n | 308,745,538\n |\n| Population %±, 2000−2010\n | −1.9%\n | +3.4%\n | +9.7%\n |\n| Population density\n | 4,631.7/sq mi (1,788.3/km2)\n | 283.4/sq mi (109.4/km2)\n | 87.3/sq mi (33.7/km2)\n |\n| Median household income (1999)\n | $28,387\n | $34,619\n | $41,994\n |\n| Bachelor's degree or higher\n | 17.4%\n | 22.4%\n | 24.4%\n |\n| Foreign born\n | 5.8%\n | 5.0%\n | 11.0%\n |\n| White (non-Hispanic)\n | 75.0%\n | 81.9%\n | 72.4%\n |\n| Black\n | 19.7%\n | 10.8%\n | 12.6%\n |\n| Hispanic (any race)\n | 6.9%\n | 5.7%\n | 16.3%\n |\n| Asian\n | 1.5%\n | 2.7%\n | 4.8%\n |\n\n\nErie's population was spread evenly among all age groups, with the median being 34. About 13% of families and 19% of the population were below the poverty line. Most of the people who reside in Erie are of European descent.[40]\n\n\nSince the 1980s, the International Institute of Erie (IIE), founded in 1919, has helped with the resettlement of refugees from Bosnia, Eritrea, Ghana, Iraq, Kosovo, Liberia, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, Romania, Russia, Syria, and Vietnam. The inclusion of refugees in Erie's community augments religious diversity and prompts community events such as cultural festivals.[41]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Catholic influence is present broadly in Erie, including at Mercyhurst University\nIn the early 20th century, Erie had a significant Russian immigrant community, many members of which worked in the shipbuilding plants along the bayfront. Unusual for a Great Lakes city, a substantial number of these Russian immigrants were priestless (*Bespopovtsy*) Old Believers. In 1983, most of this community united with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, and Father Pimen Simon became an Old Ritualist priest within the canonical Eastern Orthodox Church.[42] Even today, the gold-domed Church of the Nativity,[43] on the bayfront near the former heart of the Russian community, is an Old Ritualist church and home parish to the famed iconographer Fr. Theodore Jurewicz.[44]\n\n\nThe Erie Jewish community is over 150 years old. Temple Anshe Hesed, a member of the Union for Reform Judaism, is served by its spiritual leader, Rabbi Robert Morais.[45] Congregation Brith Sholom (Jewish Center) is affiliated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, and Rabbi Leonard Lifshen has been its spiritual leader since 1989.\n\n\nErie is home to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie, covering 13 counties—at 9,936 sq mi (25,734 km2), it is the largest in the state in area. Its diocesan seat is Saint Peter Cathedral in Erie, which has a 265 ft (81 m) central tower flanked by two 150 ft (46 m) towers. Since October 1, 2012, Lawrence T. Persico has been the bishop of Erie; Donald Trautman was the bishop emeritus of the diocese until his death in 2022.[46]\n\n\nAccording to the Association of Religion Data Archives,[47] Erie County had a total population of 280,843 people in 2000, of which 103,333 claimed affiliation with the Catholic Church, 40,301 with mainline Protestant houses of worship, and 12,980 with evangelical Protestant churches.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The Erie Forge and Steel factory at 16th and Greengarden Streets\nErie is the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's primary access point to Lake Erie, the Great Lakes, and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The city emerged as a maritime center after the American Revolution, then as a railroad hub during the great American westward expansion. Erie became an important city for iron and steel manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution and thrived well into the 20th century with firms such as Griswold Manufacturing, once the leader in cast-iron cookware.\n\n\nSince the decline of large manufacturers in the later 20th century, a more diverse mix of midsized industries has emerged. This broader economic base includes smaller and more agile steel and plastic plants (with about 10% of tooling and molding located in the tri-state area) and vigorous service sectors: health, insurance, and tourism. The zip code 16501 covering some of the downtown areas is considered one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country.[48][49]\n\n\nErie is the corporate headquarters of the Erie Insurance Group and Marquette Savings Bank. Lord Corporation was founded and has major operations in Erie.[50] Along with GE and Erie Insurance, major employers in the county include the county, state, and federal governments, as well as the Erie City School District.[51]\n\n\nOver 10% of the USA's plastics are manufactured or finished in Erie-based plastics plants.[7] Erie is an emerging center for biofuels and environmental research, producing over 45 million U.S. gallons of biofuel a year.[52] Tourism plays an increasingly important role in the local economy with over 4 million people visiting Presque Isle State Park and other attractions. Shoppers from Ohio, New York, and the Canadian province of Ontario frequent the Millcreek Mall and Peach Street stores and attractions as a result of Pennsylvania's tax exemption on clothing.\n\n\nBoth UPMC Hamot and Saint Vincent Health System are also major employers in Erie.[51] Although both of these hospitals had been stand-alone Erie entities, Hamot merged with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in 2011[53] and Saint Vincent, which affiliated with the Cleveland Clinic in 2012,[54] merged with Highmark's Allegheny Health Network in 2013.[55] The United States Department of Veterans Affairs operates the Erie Veterans Affairs Medical Center on East 38th Street. The Shriners International has operated Shriners Hospital for Children in Erie since 1927.[56]\nLake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) is a fast-growing educator and provider of healthcare in the city. LECOM is located both in the city and in adjacent Millcreek Township.\n\n\n\n## Arts and culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bicentennial Tower and the *Niagara*\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nThe Erie Art Museum is the city's main art gallery, located in the Old Customshouse on State Street. Its collection has an emphasis on folk art and modern art and it hosts a popular blues and jazz concert series. The Erie Art Museum also works on public art projects to revitalize and improve the city. In 2000, the Erie Art Museum created a project entitled GoFish, similar to CowParade; 95 fiberglass fish were decorated by Erie artists and placed throughout the city. Patrons paid $3,000 for a fish and the proceeds went to Gannon University's scholarship fund and the Erie Public Art endowment fund.[57] The Erie Art Museum created a similar public art project in 2004 that involved frogs rather than fish.[58] In 2012, the Erie Art Museum began a project to create 40 artistic and functional bike racks, designed and created by local artists.[59] The museum intends to add color and interest to downtown Erie and to promote bicycling, encourage healthy lifestyles, and provide environmental awareness.[60]\n\n\nThe Erie Maritime Museum recognizes Erie's significance during the War of 1812 and is home to the USS Brig *Niagara*, a modern recreation of the 1813 USS *Niagara* which served as Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's relief flagship during the Battle of Lake Erie.[61]\n\n\n\n### Entertainment[edit]\n\n\nErie is home to several professional and amateur performing arts groups. The most significant is the Erie Philharmonic, in continuous existence since 1913 (except an interregnum during World War II). This group of professional musicians also has a full chorus and a junior philharmonic division that tours the area. The Lake Erie Ballet is a professional company that performs well-known programs throughout the year.[62] The Erie Civic Music Association attracts, sponsors, and books performances by professional musicians, singers, entertainers, and ensembles from around the world.[63]\n\n\nDowntown Erie's historic and ornate Warner Theatre hosts a range of performances. Renovated in the 1980s and again in 2007,[64] the Warner is the hub of Erie's Civic Center. The downtown area is the home of the Erie Playhouse, one of the leading community theaters in the country, and the third-oldest community theater in the U.S.[65] Erie is also home to several other community theatres, including Dramashop, PACA, and All an Act Theatre. In addition to regular performances, Erie has many festivals including motorcycle rallies. Since 2007, the annual Roar on the Shore motorcycle rally has taken place in Erie, although in 2019, it moved to the Lake Erie Speedway.\n\n\nPresque Isle Downs & Casino opened on February 28, 2007, and was the fourth slots parlor in the state and the first in Western Pennsylvania.[66] Table games opened at the casino on July 8, 2010.[67]\n\n\nErie is home to The Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps, ten-time Drum Corps International World Champion as of 2023. The Cadets entered a long-term partnership with the Erie Sports Center in February 2023, prompting them to move The Cadets all operations of Cadets Arts & Entertainment, Inc. to Erie.[68][69]\n\n\nErie has been the location for many movies, including the hometown for the fictional band The Wonders in *That Thing You Do!* featuring Tom Hanks. It is mentioned in the film *Wall Street* as the location of the fictional company Anacott Steel. Erie is the hometown of Train lead singer, Patrick Monahan. Erie is also the hometown of Marc Brown, the author and illustrator of *Arthur* books and TV series.\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Erie Maritime Museum, the *Niagara*, and the Main Library\nThere are five Erie County library system branches in Erie, and a bookmobile.[70] The Main Library opened in 1996,[71] and is the third-largest library in Pennsylvania.[72] It is connected to the Erie Maritime Museum, and has waterfront views of the Presque Isle Bay. The Main Library contains an art collection and provides internet access to patrons.[73] The four remaining libraries are the Edinboro Branch Library, Iroquois Avenue Branch Library, Lincoln Community Center Branch Library, and Millcreek Branch Library.[70]\n\n\n\n### Historic structures[edit]\n\n\nAlong West 6th Street is Millionaires Row, a collection of 19th-century Victorian mansions. The John Hill House is one of the notable residences. First Presbyterian Church of the Covenant, a well-known landmark, is also located here. The Watson-Curtze Mansion, one of the most notable residences on this street, is also home to the Erie County Historical Society.[74] Permanent and rotating exhibits showcase the life of some of Erie's influential founders and the development of Erie.\n\n\nThe Erie Land Light stands at the foot of Lighthouse Street.[75] The lighthouse was built in 1818 and replaced in 1867.\n\n\nThe Bicentennial Tower, on Dobbins Landing at the foot of State Street, was built in 1995−96 to celebrate the city's bicentennial. It is 187 ft (57 m) tall and gives a panoramic view of Lake Erie and downtown. The Blasco Library and Erie Maritime Museum are its neighbors to the east.\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)UPMC Park, home of the Erie SeaWolves, pictured from the first-base side overlooking downtown Erie\nErie plays host to several semi-professional and professional sports teams. The Erie SeaWolves play AA baseball in the Eastern League as an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. The Erie Otters play hockey in the Ontario Hockey League. Hockey games are played at Erie Insurance Arena, while Minor League Baseball games are held at UPMC Park.\n\n\nGannon University, Mercyhurst University, Edinboro University, and Penn State Behrend have active NCAA collegiate sports programs. The local high schools compete in PIAA District 10 sporting events. Additionally, Cathedral Preparatory School hosts the annual high-school basketball tournament featuring top national teams, called the Burger King Classic since 2010. Scholastic and intramural sports are held at school and park facilities around the city. The Mercyhurst Ice Center, JMC Ice Arena, Erie Sports Park, and Erie Veterans Memorial Stadium are many sports arenas and stadiums available in and around the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Club\n | League\n | Sport\n | Venue\n | Established\n | Championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Erie SeaWolves | EL | Baseball | UPMC Park | 1995\n | 2 (2023, 2024)\n |\n| Erie Otters | OHL | Ice hockey | Erie Insurance Arena | 1996\n | 2 (2002, 2017)\n |\n| Erie Express | GDFL | Football | Erie Veterans Memorial Stadium | 2012\n | 3 (2010, 2021, 2022)\n |\n| Erie Commodores FC | NPSL | Men's soccer | McConnell Family Stadium | 2009\n |  |\n| Erie Commodores FC | UWS | Women's soccer | McConnell Family Stadium | 2021\n |  |\n| Erie FC\n | WPSL | Women's soccer | Gus Anderson Field | 2022\n |  |\n\n\n\n## Parks and recreation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of city parks of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)Looking towards Presque Isle Bay and Downtown Erie from Presque Isle State Park\nDowntown Erie is surrounded by Presque Isle State Park, a National Natural Landmark.[76] The Seaway Trail runs through downtown Erie along the lakefront. The Tom Ridge Environmental Center, at the foot of Presque Isle, features 7,000 sq ft (650 m2) of exhibit space.[77]\n\n\nThe region grows grapes and produces the third-largest amount of wine in the United States.[4] Other tourist destinations include the Bayfront Convention Center; the Bicentennial Tower that overlooks Lake Erie; Dobbins Landing, a pier in downtown Erie; the Erie Land Light, and the Erie Maritime Museum, the home port of the *Niagara*. The 2,600,000 sq ft (240,000 m2) Millcreek Mall, one of the largest shopping malls in the United States, is located on Peach Street in nearby Millcreek Township.[78] The indoor waterpark Splash Lagoon, in Summit Township, is the largest indoor waterpark on the East Coast and third-largest in the United States.[65] Waldameer Park, located at the base of Presque Isle, is the fourth-oldest amusement park in Pennsylvania, and the 10th-oldest in the US.[79]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mayors of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The Erie Municipal Building on State Street\nThe city of Erie is incorporated as a third-class city under Pennsylvania law.[80] Incorporated under an \"optional charter\", the city is governed by a mayor–council government. The government consists of a mayor, treasurer, and controller, and a seven-member city council. They are elected to four-year terms, with the terms of the council designed to be overlapping.[80] The mayor is chief executive and the city council prepares legislation and conducts oversight. The city council meets in Mario S. Bagnoni Council Chambers at City Hall. Joseph Schember (D) is the mayor of the city of Erie and was first elected in 2017. As of February 2023[update], the Erie City Council consists of:[81]\n\n\n\n* Michael Keys\n* Ed Brzezinski\n* Jasmine Flores\n* Chuck Nelson\n* Maurice \"Mo\" Troop\n* Mel Witherspoon\n* Susannah Faulkner[82]\n\n\nErie is the largest city in Pennsylvania's 16th congressional district and is currently represented in Congress by Republican Mike Kelly, who was elected in 2010. Republican Dan Laughlin of the 49th District represents Erie in the Pennsylvania State Senate. The city of Erie is split by the 1st and 2nd Districts of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and is represented by Democrats Patrick Harkins and Robert E. Merski, respectively.[83]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Erie City School District and Higher education in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine's main campus\nErie Public Schools enroll 12,527 students in primary and secondary grades.[84] The district has 23 public schools including elementary, middle, and high schools, with one charter school. Other than public schools, the city is home to more than 40 private schools and academies. Erie public schools are under frequent criticism for education quality, school rankings, and abnormally high teacher salaries.[*citation needed*]\nThe City of Erie is served by two public high schools, Erie High School and Northwest Pennsylvania Collegiate Academy, plus three Catholic high schools: Cathedral Preparatory School, Mercyhurst Preparatory School, and Villa Maria Academy.\n\n\nErie is home to several colleges and universities, including Gannon University located in downtown Erie, and Mercyhurst University in the southeast part of the city. Other notable colleges in the Erie area include Penn State Erie, The Behrend College, Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM, a large medical school), and Edinboro University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\nErie is also home to the Barber National Institute and its Elizabeth Lee Black School, which provides services and education for children and adults with mental disabilities. Erie is home to its main campus, and it provides services in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.[85] The Achievement Center also serves the needs of children from birth to age 21 with physical and mental health disabilities.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The *Erie Times-News* headquarters office\nErie is served by *Erie Times-News*, the city's daily newspaper, as well as *Erie Reader*, an alternative weekly newspaper.\n\n\nThe Nielsen Company ranks Erie as 152 out of the 210 largest television markets in the United States, as of the 2019−2020 report.[86] The market is served by stations affiliated with major American networks, including WICU-TV 12 (NBC), WJET-TV 24 (ABC), WFXP 66 (FOX), WSEE-TV 35 (CBS), and WSEE-DT2 35.2 (CW). WQLN 54 is a member station of PBS and also broadcasts toward London, Ontario. Cable companies available for Erie include Charter Spectrum, DirecTV, and Dish Network.\n\n\nErie is served by several AM and FM radio stations based in the city, and dozens of other nearby station broadcasts can be heard.\n\n\nIn August 2019, Erie was the subject of a new television show, *Undercover Billionaire*, from the Discovery Channel. In this show, a wealthy businessman, Glenn Stearns, travels to Erie under a fake name, Glenn Bryant. He starts with $100, a cell phone, and an old pickup truck. He is then asked to make a business worth over $1 million in 90 days. If he fails, he has to put $1 million of his own money into the business. Stearns makes the now prosperous business of UnderDog BBQ. Although he only gets the company valuation of around $750,000, it is still a successful business to date. He gave everyone who helped his big roles in the company's future and also invested the $1 million he owed.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The last McDonnell Douglas DC-9 to fly for US Air arriving at Erie International Airport\n![](image)Union Station is served by Amtrak's *Lake Shore Limited*\n![](image)A road map of Erie and its major routes\n![](image)Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority\nErie is well connected to the Interstate Highway System. Six \"Erie exits\" are along Interstate 90, a major cross-country thoroughfare running from Boston to Seattle. Erie is the northern terminus of Interstate 79, which travels south to Pittsburgh and, ultimately, West Virginia. The western terminus for Interstate 86, also called the \"Southern Tier Expressway\", is at Interstate 90 near Harborcreek, between Erie and North East. Interstate 86 continues east through New York to Binghamton. The Bayfront Connector runs from Interstate 90 in Harborcreek to the Bayfront Parkway and downtown Erie, along the east side of the city, then connects to Interstate 79 on the west side of the city. Major thoroughfares in the city include 12th Street, 26th Street, 38th Street, and Peach Street. Peach is also a part of U.S. Route 19, whose northern terminus is in Erie and continues south, eventually reaching the Gulf of Mexico. Other major routes running through Erie are Pennsylvania Route 5, known as the Seaway Trail and is made up of parts of 6th Street, 8th Street, 12th Street, and East Lake Road in the city, U.S. Route 20, which is 26th Street in the city. The city is divided between east and west by State Street.\n\n\nThe Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority operates the city's transit bus system, known as the 'e'. Buses run seven days a week in the city, with trips out to other parts of the county occurring a few times a week. Intercity buses providing transportation between Buffalo, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh are operated by Greyhound Lines. Service between Buffalo and Cleveland is also provided by Lakefront Lines. Both companies operate out of the Intermodal Transportation Center, which opened in 2002 at the foot of Holland Street.\n\n\nThe former \"Water Level Route\" of the New York Central Railroad travels directly through Erie. It is now the mainline for CSX freight trains. The main line of the Norfolk Southern Railway, originally built by the Nickel Plate Railroad, also travels through Erie. At one time, Norfolk Southern trains ran down the middle of 19th Street, but were removed in 2002.[87] Passenger rail service is provided by Amtrak's *Lake Shore Limited* out of Union Station at 14th and State Streets. The *Lake Shore Limited* stops twice daily—one eastbound towards New York City or Boston, and one westbound towards Chicago.\n\n\nErie International Airport and Tom Ridge Field (IATA code: ERI; ICAO code: KERI) are located 5 miles (8.0 km) west of the city and host general aviation, charter, and airline service. Destinations with nonstop flights out of Erie include Chicago O'Hare International Airport via United Airlines, Charlotte Douglas International Airport via American Airlines, and Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport via Delta Air Lines (Currently suspended). Erie International is amid an $80.5 million runway extension. The extension is slated to increase the runway's length by 1,920 ft (590 m), for a total runway length of 8,420 ft (2,600 m), \"to meet safety requirements\" and allow the airport to accommodate larger aircraft.[88]\n\n\nThe Port of Erie is located on Presque Isle Bay, a natural harbor formed by Presque Isle. It offers some of the finest port facilities for cargo shipping on the Great Lakes, with direct rail access. The Erie−Western Pennsylvania Port Authority provides water taxi service in the summer between Dobbins Landing and Liberty Park in downtown Erie, and the Waterworks ferry landing on Presque Isle.[89]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\nThe Erie Water Works, which was incorporated in 1865 as the Erie Water and Gas Company, includes a reservoir, two water-treatment plants, and an elaborate water works and pipe network that provides water for most of the city and suburbs. Penelec, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy, supplies electricity to the region, as well as the Northwestern Pennsylvania Rural Electric Cooperative. National Fuel Gas Company provides residents with natural gas. Time Warner Cable became the region's cable television provider, after taking over Adelphia, and also provides digital phone and high-speed internet to the region. Local telephone and high-speed internet service are also provided by Verizon.\n\n\nSewage service in Erie is provided by the Erie Sewer Authority, and many outlying townships have partnerships with the Sewer Authority for service. The authority cleans about 30 40×10~~^~~6 US gal (150,000 m3) of wastewater every day.[90]\n\n\nThe time and temperature number in Erie is 452-6311 and was originally discontinued by Verizon in October 2008 before being restarted by a private individual two years later.[91] The city of Erie and northwest Pennsylvania is located in area code 814. On December 16, 2010, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) voted to split the area code, which was to take effect February 1, 2012.[92] The North American Numbering Plan decided that northwest Pennsylvania would receive the new code of 582. A local grassroots coalition began organizing an opposition to the plan and generated numerous petitions for reconsideration. The PUC immediately voted to review their decision and ordered additional public-input hearings and technical conferences as a response to the strong public outcry.[93] In January 2011, the PUC announced that it was placing the entire area code split plan on hold as NEUSTAR pushed the projected exhaustion date back two years to 2015.[94]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The city currently has six fire stations and protects about 20 sq mi (52 km2). The city has five engine companies, including two rescue engines, one tower company, and one water-rescue unit. The city provides mutual aid to fire departments of Millcreek Township, Summit Township, and East County.\n\n\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\nErie has four official sister cities as designated by Sister Cities International:[96]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Dungarvan, Ireland (2007)\n* ![](image) Lublin, Poland (1998)\n* ![](image) Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico (1973)\n* ![](image) Zibo, Shandong, China (1985)\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n* List of people from Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n\n\n* USS *Erie*, at least one ship==References==\n\n\n1. **^** \"ArcGIS REST Services Directory\".

Erie is the fifth-largest city in Pennsylvania and the largest city in Northwestern Pennsylvania[3][4] with a population of 94,831 at the 2020 census.[3] The estimated population in 2023 had decreased to 92,732.[5] The Erie metropolitan area, equivalent to all of Erie County, consists of 266,096 residents. The Erie–Meadville combined statistical area had a population of 369,331 at the 2010 census.\n\n\nErie is located approximately 80 miles (130 km) from Buffalo, 90 miles (140 km) from Cleveland, and 120 miles (190 km) from Pittsburgh.[6] Erie's manufacturing sector remains prominent in the local economy, while insurance, healthcare, higher education, technology, service industries, and tourism are emerging as significant economic drivers. Like the other Great Lakes port cities, Erie is accessible to the oceans via the Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River network in Canada. The local climate is humid, four-seasonal, and snowy, with warm summers and harsh winters, owing to its southern lakeshore location.\n\n\nThe city was named for the Native American Erie people who lived in the area until the mid-17th century. Erie is nicknamed both the \"Gem City\", in reference to it once being known as the \"Gem of the Great Lakes\" due to its fine natural harbor; and more recently, the \"Flagship City\", from a local marketing effort to promote its status as the home port of Oliver Hazard Perry's flagship *Niagara*.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The Battle of Lake Erie in the War of 1812, a key historical event in Erie's history\nIndigenous peoples occupied the shoreline and bluffs in this area for thousands of years, taking advantage of the rich resources. Sommerheim Park Archaeological District in Millcreek Township west of the city, includes artifacts from the Archaic period in the Americas and the early and middle Woodland Period, roughly a span from 8,000 BCE to 500 CE.[8]\n\n\nEuropeans first arrived as settlers in the region when the French constructed Fort Presque Isle near present-day Erie in 1753, as part of their effort to defend New France against the encroaching British colonists. The name of the fort refers to the peninsula that juts into Lake Erie, now protected as Presque Isle State Park. The French term *presque-isle* means peninsula. When the French abandoned the fort in 1760 during the French and Indian War in the Seven Years' War, it was the last post they held west of Niagara River. The British established a garrison at the fort at Presque Isle that same year, three years before the end of the French and Indian War.[9]\n\n\nErie is in what was the disputed Erie Triangle, a tract of land comprising 202,187 acres in the northwest corner of Pennsylvania fronting Lake Erie that was claimed after the American Revolutionary War by the newly formed states of New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, as part of its Western Reserve, and Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution\n\nThe Iroquois claimed ownership of present-day Erie. On January 9. 1789, a conference was arranged during which representatives from the Iroquois signed a deed relinquishing their ownership of the land[10] in exchange for $2,000 from Pennsylvania and $1,200 from the federal government. Seneca Nation separately settled land claims against Pennsylvania in February 1791 for the sum of $800. It became a part of Pennsylvania on March 3, 1792, after Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York relinquished their rights to the land and sold the land to Pennsylvania for 75 cents per acre or a total of $151,640.25 in continental certificates.[11]\n\n\nThe General Assembly of Pennsylvania commissioned the surveying of land near Presque Isle through an act passed on April 18, 1795. Andrew Ellicott, who completed Pierre Charles L'Enfant's survey of Washington, D.C., and helped resolve the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York, arrived to begin the survey and lay out the plan for the city in June 1795. The initial settlement of the area began that year.[11][12] Lt. Colonel Seth Reed and his family moved to the Erie area from Geneva, New York; they were Yankees from Uxbridge, Massachusetts. They became the first European-American settlers of Erie in present-day Presque Isle.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Battle of Lake Erie and Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\nPresident James Madison began the construction of a naval fleet during the War of 1812 to gain control of the Great Lakes from the British. Daniel Dobbins of Erie and Noah Brown of Boston were notable shipbuilders who led the construction of four schooner−rigged gunboats and two brigs. Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry arrived from Rhode Island and led the squadron to success in the historic Battle of Lake Erie.[13]\n\n\nErie was an important shipbuilding, fishing, and railroad hub during the mid-19th century. The city was the site where three sets of track gauges met. While the delays engendered cargo troubles for commerce and travel, they provided much-needed local jobs in Erie. When a national standardized gauge was proposed, those jobs, and the importance of the rail hub itself, were put in jeopardy. In an event known as the Erie Gauge War, the citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up tracks, and rioted to try to stop the standardization.[14]\n\n\n\n### 20th and 21st centuries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)State and 9th Streets in downtown Erie during the early 1920s\nOn August 3, 1915, the Mill Creek flooded downtown Erie. A culvert, or a tunnel, was blocked by debris and collapsed.[15] A four-block reservoir, caused by torrential downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting deluge destroyed 225 houses and killed 36 people.[15] After the flood, Mayor Miles Brown Kitts had the Mill Creek directed into another, larger culvert, constructed under more than 2 miles of the city, before emptying into Presque Isle Bay on the city's lower east side.\n\n\nErie continued to grow for the first half of the 20th century, due to its strong manufacturing base. The city attracted numerous waves of European immigrants for industrial jobs. Erie was considered a wet city during the Prohibition Era in the United States. The city's economy began to suffer in the latter part of the 20th century as industrial restructuring took place and jobs moved out of the area. The Erie region is considered to be part of the Rust Belt. The importance of American manufacturing, US steel and coal production, and commercial fishing began to gradually decline,[16] resulting in a major population downturn in the 1970s.[16]\n\n\nWith the advent of the automobile age after World War II and government subsidies for highway construction, thousands of residents left Erie for suburbs such as Millcreek Township, which now has 55,000 residents.[16] This caused a decline in downtown retail businesses, some of which followed to the suburbs. Reflecting this perceived decline, Erie is occasionally referred to by residents as \"The Mistake on the Lake\" or \"Dreary Erie\".[17] Downtown Erie has undergone a resurgence in the early 2020s with the opening of Flagship City Food Hall and Flagship City Public Market.[18] [19]\n\n\nErie won the All-America City Award in 1972 and was a finalist in 1961, 1994, 1995, and 2009.[20][21] In 2012, Erie hosted the Perry 200,[22] a commemoration celebrating 200 years of peace between Britain, America, and Canada following the War of 1812 and Battle of Lake Erie.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of downtown Erie in 1912 looking West along the 15th Street tracks; the tallest steeple to the north of the tracks is St. Peter Cathedral.\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mill Creek passes through much of Erie, including the grounds of the Erie Zoo\nErie is situated in Northwestern Pennsylvania at 42°6′52″N 80°4′34″W﻿ / ﻿42.11444°N 80.07611°W﻿ / 42.11444; -80.07611 (42.114507, -80.076213),[23] on the southern shore of Lake Erie across from the Canadian province of Ontario. It is 100 miles (160 km) northeast of Cleveland, Ohio, 90 miles (140 km) southwest of Buffalo, New York, and 128 miles (206 km) north of Pittsburgh. Erie's bedrock is Devonian shale and siltstone, overlain by glacial tills and stratified drift. Stream drainage in the city flows northward into Lake Erie, then through Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence River, and out to the Atlantic Ocean. South of Erie is a drainage divide, beyond which most of the streams in western Pennsylvania flow south into the Allegheny or Ohio Rivers.[24] Lake Erie is about 571 ft (174 m) above sea level, while the city of Erie is about 728 ft (222 m) above sea level.\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 19.3 square miles (49.9 km2), with 19.1 square miles (49.4 km2) being land and the remaining 0.2 square miles (0.5 km2), or 1.03%, being water.[25] Presque Isle State Park (referred to by locals as \"the Peninsula\" or simply \"the beach\"), is a recurving sandspit peninsula that streches north into Lake Erie, providing a fine, natural harbor for Erie and offers 7 miles (11 km) of public beaches, wetlands, and fishing sites.\n\n\nErie fronts Presque Isle Bay and is laid out in a grid surrounding Perry Square in the downtown area.[26] The downtown area is separated from the waterfront by the Bayfront Parkway.[26] The tallest structure in Erie is St. Peter Cathedral at 265 ft (81 m), and the tallest building is Renaissance Centre at 198 ft (60 m). Historically, Erie had numerous ethnic neighborhoods, including Little Italy, which is located on Erie's west side, featuring the West 18th Street commercial corridor. South of 38th Street, the grid gives way to curvilinear roads of post-1970 suburban development. Millcreek Township and upper Peach Street in Summit Township include the Erie metropolitan area's newer developments.\n\n\nPost-industrial redevelopment of Erie's waterfront aimed at recreational and tourism uses include the Bayfront Parkway, Niagara Pier, Perry's Landing Marina, Liberty Park & Amphitheater, Bayfront Convention Center, hotels, and Dobbins Landing, which features the Bicentennial Tower at its northern end. On the east side of the bayfront, the Erie Maritime Museum and the Erie County main library (third-largest in Pennsylvania), host the USS *Niagara*. Docks and marinas fill the freshwater shoreline in between.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Erie falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. It is located in the snow belt that stretches from Cleveland to Syracuse and Watertown; winters are moderately cold, with heavy lake-effect snow, but also with occasional stretches of mild weather that cause accumulated snow to melt. The city experiences a full range of weather events, including snow, ice, rain, thunderstorms, and fog. The city's lakeside location helps to temper summer heat, with an average of 4 days with highs at or above 90 °F (32 °C) annually, and the highest temperature ever recorded was 100 °F (38 °C) on June 25, 1988. An average of 3 days have lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or colder annually, and the lowest temperature ever recorded was −18 °F (−28 °C) on January 19, 1994, and February 16, 2015.[27]\n\n\nErie is third on *The Daily Beast*'s list of snowiest places in the United States, averaging 78.7 inches (200 cm);[28] however, the 1981–2010 normal seasonal snowfall is 100.8 inches (256 cm). Average annual snowfall in the decade 2010-2019 was 100.7 inches (256 cm).[29] The adverse winter conditions caused USAir Flight 499 to overrun the runway at Erie International Airport on February 21, 1986, and caused whiteouts that were responsible for a 50-car pile-up on Interstate 90 on January 25, 2007.[30][31]\n\n\nThe coldest maximum temperature on record was −4 °F (−20 °C) in 1994 and the average coldest maximum between 1991 and 2020 was 13 °F (−11 °C).[27] The warmest overnight low on record was 82 °F (28 °C) once in 1918 and another time during the 1936 North American heat wave.[27] On average, the warmest low of the year is quite muggy 75 °F (24 °C).[27]\n\n\nOn December 24 and 25, 2017, Erie received 53 inches (135 cm) of snowfall, breaking a record for the largest two-day snowfall anywhere in Pennsylvania.[32][33] By the close of the 2017–2018 snow season, Erie had recorded 198.5 in (5.04 m) of snow, its snowiest season on record, breaking the previous record of 149.1 in (3.79 m) inches set in 2000–2001 by a large margin.[27]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Erie, Pennsylvania (Erie International Airport), 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1873–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 73(23)\n | 77(25)\n | 82(28)\n | 89(32)\n | 91(33)\n | 100(38)\n | 99(37)\n | 96(36)\n | 99(37)\n | 89(32)\n | 82(28)\n | 75(24)\n | 100(38)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 58.9(14.9)\n | 58.5(14.7)\n | 69.1(20.6)\n | 79.6(26.4)\n | 85.1(29.5)\n | 90.2(32.3)\n | 90.5(32.5)\n | 89.8(32.1)\n | 87.1(30.6)\n | 79.3(26.3)\n | 68.4(20.2)\n | 59.7(15.4)\n | 92.4(33.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 35.2(1.8)\n | 36.5(2.5)\n | 44.3(6.8)\n | 56.8(13.8)\n | 68.3(20.2)\n | 77.1(25.1)\n | 81.1(27.3)\n | 79.9(26.6)\n | 73.7(23.2)\n | 62.3(16.8)\n | 50.5(10.3)\n | 40.2(4.6)\n | 58.8(14.9)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 28.2(−2.1)\n | 28.9(−1.7)\n | 36.1(2.3)\n | 47.4(8.6)\n | 58.8(14.9)\n | 68.2(20.1)\n | 72.7(22.6)\n | 71.5(21.9)\n | 65.2(18.4)\n | 54.3(12.4)\n | 43.6(6.4)\n | 34.1(1.2)\n | 50.8(10.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 21.3(−5.9)\n | 21.4(−5.9)\n | 27.9(−2.3)\n | 38.0(3.3)\n | 49.3(9.6)\n | 59.4(15.2)\n | 64.2(17.9)\n | 63.2(17.3)\n | 56.7(13.7)\n | 46.3(7.9)\n | 36.7(2.6)\n | 28.0(−2.2)\n | 42.7(5.9)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 3.6(−15.8)\n | 4.1(−15.5)\n | 11.2(−11.6)\n | 25.7(−3.5)\n | 35.3(1.8)\n | 45.7(7.6)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 53.0(11.7)\n | 44.4(6.9)\n | 33.9(1.1)\n | 23.8(−4.6)\n | 13.3(−10.4)\n | 0.2(−17.7)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −18(−28)\n | −18(−28)\n | −9(−23)\n | 7(−14)\n | 26(−3)\n | 32(0)\n | 44(7)\n | 37(3)\n | 33(1)\n | 23(−5)\n | 6(−14)\n | −11(−24)\n | −18(−28)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 3.41(87)\n | 2.52(64)\n | 3.08(78)\n | 3.47(88)\n | 3.50(89)\n | 3.70(94)\n | 3.33(85)\n | 3.35(85)\n | 4.32(110)\n | 4.38(111)\n | 3.75(95)\n | 4.17(106)\n | 42.98(1,092)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 31.8(81)\n | 19.4(49)\n | 14.5(37)\n | 2.6(6.6)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 9.6(24)\n | 26.3(67)\n | 104.3(265)\n |\n| Average extreme snow depth inches (cm)\n | 9.9(25)\n | 9.1(23)\n | 7.3(19)\n | 1.7(4.3)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 4.8(12)\n | 7.6(19)\n | 13.8(35)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 19.7\n | 15.4\n | 14.3\n | 14.0\n | 13.5\n | 11.5\n | 10.5\n | 10.2\n | 10.1\n | 14.3\n | 14.9\n | 18.5\n | 166.9\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 16.3\n | 12.3\n | 7.8\n | 2.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.2\n | 4.8\n | 11.5\n | 55.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 74.5\n | 75.4\n | 71.9\n | 67.9\n | 68.9\n | 71.3\n | 71.7\n | 74.0\n | 74.5\n | 71.1\n | 72.3\n | 75.0\n | 72.4\n |\n| Source: NOAA (relative humidity 1961–1990)[27][34][35] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1800 | 81 |  | — |\n| 1810 | 394 |  | 386.4% |\n| 1820 | 635 |  | 61.2% |\n| 1830 | 1,465 |  | 130.7% |\n| 1840 | 3,412 |  | 132.9% |\n| 1850 | 5,858 |  | 71.7% |\n| 1860 | 9,419 |  | 60.8% |\n| 1870 | 19,646 |  | 108.6% |\n| 1880 | 27,737 |  | 41.2% |\n| 1890 | 40,634 |  | 46.5% |\n| 1900 | 52,733 |  | 29.8% |\n| 1910 | 66,525 |  | 26.2% |\n| 1920 | 93,372 |  | 40.4% |\n| 1930 | 115,967 |  | 24.2% |\n| 1940 | 116,955 |  | 0.9% |\n| 1950 | 130,803 |  | 11.8% |\n| 1960 | 138,440 |  | 5.8% |\n| 1970 | 129,231 |  | −6.7% |\n| 1980 | 119,123 |  | −7.8% |\n| 1990 | 108,718 |  | −8.7% |\n| 2000 | 103,717 |  | −4.6% |\n| 2010 | 101,786 |  | −1.9% |\n| 2020 | 94,831 |  | −6.8% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[36][2] |\n\n\nAs of the 2010 United States Census, 101,786 people,[37] 40,913 households, and 22,915 families were residing in the city.[38] Its 44,790 housing units averaged a vacancy rate of 8%. Erie has long been declining in population due to the departure of factories and dependent businesses.[39] The city has lost about 40,000 people since the early 1960s, allowing Allentown to claim the position as Pennsylvania's third-largest city behind Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographics of Erie compared on the state and national levels, as of 2010[update] Census\n|  | Erie\n | Pennsylvania\n | United States\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total population\n | 101,786\n | 12,702,379\n | 308,745,538\n |\n| Population %±, 2000−2010\n | −1.9%\n | +3.4%\n | +9.7%\n |\n| Population density\n | 4,631.7/sq mi (1,788.3/km2)\n | 283.4/sq mi (109.4/km2)\n | 87.3/sq mi (33.7/km2)\n |\n| Median household income (1999)\n | $28,387\n | $34,619\n | $41,994\n |\n| Bachelor's degree or higher\n | 17.4%\n | 22.4%\n | 24.4%\n |\n| Foreign born\n | 5.8%\n | 5.0%\n | 11.0%\n |\n| White (non-Hispanic)\n | 75.0%\n | 81.9%\n | 72.4%\n |\n| Black\n | 19.7%\n | 10.8%\n | 12.6%\n |\n| Hispanic (any race)\n | 6.9%\n | 5.7%\n | 16.3%\n |\n| Asian\n | 1.5%\n | 2.7%\n | 4.8%\n |\n\n\nErie's population was spread evenly among all age groups, with the median being 34. About 13% of families and 19% of the population were below the poverty line. Most of the people who reside in Erie are of European descent.[40]\n\n\nSince the 1980s, the International Institute of Erie (IIE), founded in 1919, has helped with the resettlement of refugees from Bosnia, Eritrea, Ghana, Iraq, Kosovo, Liberia, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, Romania, Russia, Syria, and Vietnam. The inclusion of refugees in Erie's community augments religious diversity and prompts community events such as cultural festivals.[41]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Catholic influence is present broadly in Erie, including at Mercyhurst University\nIn the early 20th century, Erie had a significant Russian immigrant community, many members of which worked in the shipbuilding plants along the bayfront. Unusual for a Great Lakes city, a substantial number of these Russian immigrants were priestless (*Bespopovtsy*) Old Believers. In 1983, most of this community united with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, and Father Pimen Simon became an Old Ritualist priest within the canonical Eastern Orthodox Church.[42] Even today, the gold-domed Church of the Nativity,[43] on the bayfront near the former heart of the Russian community, is an Old Ritualist church and home parish to the famed iconographer Fr. Theodore Jurewicz.[44]\n\n\nThe Erie Jewish community is over 150 years old. Temple Anshe Hesed, a member of the Union for Reform Judaism, is served by its spiritual leader, Rabbi Robert Morais.[45] Congregation Brith Sholom (Jewish Center) is affiliated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, and Rabbi Leonard Lifshen has been its spiritual leader since 1989.\n\n\nErie is home to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie, covering 13 counties—at 9,936 sq mi (25,734 km2), it is the largest in the state in area. Its diocesan seat is Saint Peter Cathedral in Erie, which has a 265 ft (81 m) central tower flanked by two 150 ft (46 m) towers. Since October 1, 2012, Lawrence T. Persico has been the bishop of Erie; Donald Trautman was the bishop emeritus of the diocese until his death in 2022.[46]\n\n\nAccording to the Association of Religion Data Archives,[47] Erie County had a total population of 280,843 people in 2000, of which 103,333 claimed affiliation with the Catholic Church, 40,301 with mainline Protestant houses of worship, and 12,980 with evangelical Protestant churches.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The Erie Forge and Steel factory at 16th and Greengarden Streets\nErie is the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's primary access point to Lake Erie, the Great Lakes, and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The city emerged as a maritime center after the American Revolution, then as a railroad hub during the great American westward expansion. Erie became an important city for iron and steel manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution and thrived well into the 20th century with firms such as Griswold Manufacturing, once the leader in cast-iron cookware.\n\n\nSince the decline of large manufacturers in the later 20th century, a more diverse mix of midsized industries has emerged. This broader economic base includes smaller and more agile steel and plastic plants (with about 10% of tooling and molding located in the tri-state area) and vigorous service sectors: health, insurance, and tourism. The zip code 16501 covering some of the downtown areas is considered one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country.[48][49]\n\n\nErie is the corporate headquarters of the Erie Insurance Group and Marquette Savings Bank. Lord Corporation was founded and has major operations in Erie.[50] Along with GE and Erie Insurance, major employers in the county include the county, state, and federal governments, as well as the Erie City School District.[51]\n\n\nOver 10% of the USA's plastics are manufactured or finished in Erie-based plastics plants.[7] Erie is an emerging center for biofuels and environmental research, producing over 45 million U.S. gallons of biofuel a year.[52] Tourism plays an increasingly important role in the local economy with over 4 million people visiting Presque Isle State Park and other attractions. Shoppers from Ohio, New York, and the Canadian province of Ontario frequent the Millcreek Mall and Peach Street stores and attractions as a result of Pennsylvania's tax exemption on clothing.\n\n\nBoth UPMC Hamot and Saint Vincent Health System are also major employers in Erie.[51] Although both of these hospitals had been stand-alone Erie entities, Hamot merged with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in 2011[53] and Saint Vincent, which affiliated with the Cleveland Clinic in 2012,[54] merged with Highmark's Allegheny Health Network in 2013.[55] The United States Department of Veterans Affairs operates the Erie Veterans Affairs Medical Center on East 38th Street. The Shriners International has operated Shriners Hospital for Children in Erie since 1927.[56]\nLake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) is a fast-growing educator and provider of healthcare in the city. LECOM is located both in the city and in adjacent Millcreek Township.\n\n\n\n## Arts and culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bicentennial Tower and the *Niagara*\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nThe Erie Art Museum is the city's main art gallery, located in the Old Customshouse on State Street. Its collection has an emphasis on folk art and modern art and it hosts a popular blues and jazz concert series. The Erie Art Museum also works on public art projects to revitalize and improve the city. In 2000, the Erie Art Museum created a project entitled GoFish, similar to CowParade; 95 fiberglass fish were decorated by Erie artists and placed throughout the city. Patrons paid $3,000 for a fish and the proceeds went to Gannon University's scholarship fund and the Erie Public Art endowment fund.[57] The Erie Art Museum created a similar public art project in 2004 that involved frogs rather than fish.[58] In 2012, the Erie Art Museum began a project to create 40 artistic and functional bike racks, designed and created by local artists.[59] The museum intends to add color and interest to downtown Erie and to promote bicycling, encourage healthy lifestyles, and provide environmental awareness.[60]\n\n\nThe Erie Maritime Museum recognizes Erie's significance during the War of 1812 and is home to the USS Brig *Niagara*, a modern recreation of the 1813 USS *Niagara* which served as Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's relief flagship during the Battle of Lake Erie.[61]\n\n\n\n### Entertainment[edit]\n\n\nErie is home to several professional and amateur performing arts groups. The most significant is the Erie Philharmonic, in continuous existence since 1913 (except an interregnum during World War II). This group of professional musicians also has a full chorus and a junior philharmonic division that tours the area. The Lake Erie Ballet is a professional company that performs well-known programs throughout the year.[62] The Erie Civic Music Association attracts, sponsors, and books performances by professional musicians, singers, entertainers, and ensembles from around the world.[63]\n\n\nDowntown Erie's historic and ornate Warner Theatre hosts a range of performances. Renovated in the 1980s and again in 2007,[64] the Warner is the hub of Erie's Civic Center. The downtown area is the home of the Erie Playhouse, one of the leading community theaters in the country, and the third-oldest community theater in the U.S.[65] Erie is also home to several other community theatres, including Dramashop, PACA, and All an Act Theatre. In addition to regular performances, Erie has many festivals including motorcycle rallies. Since 2007, the annual Roar on the Shore motorcycle rally has taken place in Erie, although in 2019, it moved to the Lake Erie Speedway.\n\n\nPresque Isle Downs & Casino opened on February 28, 2007, and was the fourth slots parlor in the state and the first in Western Pennsylvania.[66] Table games opened at the casino on July 8, 2010.[67]\n\n\nErie is home to The Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps, ten-time Drum Corps International World Champion as of 2023. The Cadets entered a long-term partnership with the Erie Sports Center in February 2023, prompting them to move The Cadets all operations of Cadets Arts & Entertainment, Inc. to Erie.[68][69]\n\n\nErie has been the location for many movies, including the hometown for the fictional band The Wonders in *That Thing You Do!* featuring Tom Hanks. It is mentioned in the film *Wall Street* as the location of the fictional company Anacott Steel. Erie is the hometown of Train lead singer, Patrick Monahan. Erie is also the hometown of Marc Brown, the author and illustrator of *Arthur* books and TV series.\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Erie Maritime Museum, the *Niagara*, and the Main Library\nThere are five Erie County library system branches in Erie, and a bookmobile.[70] The Main Library opened in 1996,[71] and is the third-largest library in Pennsylvania.[72] It is connected to the Erie Maritime Museum, and has waterfront views of the Presque Isle Bay. The Main Library contains an art collection and provides internet access to patrons.[73] The four remaining libraries are the Edinboro Branch Library, Iroquois Avenue Branch Library, Lincoln Community Center Branch Library, and Millcreek Branch Library.[70]\n\n\n\n### Historic structures[edit]\n\n\nAlong West 6th Street is Millionaires Row, a collection of 19th-century Victorian mansions. The John Hill House is one of the notable residences. First Presbyterian Church of the Covenant, a well-known landmark, is also located here. The Watson-Curtze Mansion, one of the most notable residences on this street, is also home to the Erie County Historical Society.[74] Permanent and rotating exhibits showcase the life of some of Erie's influential founders and the development of Erie.\n\n\nThe Erie Land Light stands at the foot of Lighthouse Street.[75] The lighthouse was built in 1818 and replaced in 1867.\n\n\nThe Bicentennial Tower, on Dobbins Landing at the foot of State Street, was built in 1995−96 to celebrate the city's bicentennial. It is 187 ft (57 m) tall and gives a panoramic view of Lake Erie and downtown. The Blasco Library and Erie Maritime Museum are its neighbors to the east.\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)UPMC Park, home of the Erie SeaWolves, pictured from the first-base side overlooking downtown Erie\nErie plays host to several semi-professional and professional sports teams. The Erie SeaWolves play AA baseball in the Eastern League as an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. The Erie Otters play hockey in the Ontario Hockey League. Hockey games are played at Erie Insurance Arena, while Minor League Baseball games are held at UPMC Park.\n\n\nGannon University, Mercyhurst University, Edinboro University, and Penn State Behrend have active NCAA collegiate sports programs. The local high schools compete in PIAA District 10 sporting events. Additionally, Cathedral Preparatory School hosts the annual high-school basketball tournament featuring top national teams, called the Burger King Classic since 2010. Scholastic and intramural sports are held at school and park facilities around the city. The Mercyhurst Ice Center, JMC Ice Arena, Erie Sports Park, and Erie Veterans Memorial Stadium are many sports arenas and stadiums available in and around the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Club\n | League\n | Sport\n | Venue\n | Established\n | Championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Erie SeaWolves | EL | Baseball | UPMC Park | 1995\n | 2 (2023, 2024)\n |\n| Erie Otters | OHL | Ice hockey | Erie Insurance Arena | 1996\n | 2 (2002, 2017)\n |\n| Erie Express | GDFL | Football | Erie Veterans Memorial Stadium | 2012\n | 3 (2010, 2021, 2022)\n |\n| Erie Commodores FC | NPSL | Men's soccer | McConnell Family Stadium | 2009\n |  |\n| Erie Commodores FC | UWS | Women's soccer | McConnell Family Stadium | 2021\n |  |\n| Erie FC\n | WPSL | Women's soccer | Gus Anderson Field | 2022\n |  |\n\n\n\n## Parks and recreation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of city parks of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)Looking towards Presque Isle Bay and Downtown Erie from Presque Isle State Park\nDowntown Erie is surrounded by Presque Isle State Park, a National Natural Landmark.[76] The Seaway Trail runs through downtown Erie along the lakefront. The Tom Ridge Environmental Center, at the foot of Presque Isle, features 7,000 sq ft (650 m2) of exhibit space.[77]\n\n\nThe region grows grapes and produces the third-largest amount of wine in the United States.[4] Other tourist destinations include the Bayfront Convention Center; the Bicentennial Tower that overlooks Lake Erie; Dobbins Landing, a pier in downtown Erie; the Erie Land Light, and the Erie Maritime Museum, the home port of the *Niagara*. The 2,600,000 sq ft (240,000 m2) Millcreek Mall, one of the largest shopping malls in the United States, is located on Peach Street in nearby Millcreek Township.[78] The indoor waterpark Splash Lagoon, in Summit Township, is the largest indoor waterpark on the East Coast and third-largest in the United States.[65] Waldameer Park, located at the base of Presque Isle, is the fourth-oldest amusement park in Pennsylvania, and the 10th-oldest in the US.[79]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mayors of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The Erie Municipal Building on State Street\nThe city of Erie is incorporated as a third-class city under Pennsylvania law.[80] Incorporated under an \"optional charter\", the city is governed by a mayor–council government. The government consists of a mayor, treasurer, and controller, and a seven-member city council. They are elected to four-year terms, with the terms of the council designed to be overlapping.[80] The mayor is chief executive and the city council prepares legislation and conducts oversight. The city council meets in Mario S. Bagnoni Council Chambers at City Hall. Joseph Schember (D) is the mayor of the city of Erie and was first elected in 2017. As of February 2023[update], the Erie City Council consists of:[81]\n\n\n\n* Michael Keys\n* Ed Brzezinski\n* Jasmine Flores\n* Chuck Nelson\n* Maurice \"Mo\" Troop\n* Mel Witherspoon\n* Susannah Faulkner[82]\n\n\nErie is the largest city in Pennsylvania's 16th congressional district and is currently represented in Congress by Republican Mike Kelly, who was elected in 2010. Republican Dan Laughlin of the 49th District represents Erie in the Pennsylvania State Senate. The city of Erie is split by the 1st and 2nd Districts of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and is represented by Democrats Patrick Harkins and Robert E. Merski, respectively.[83]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Erie City School District and Higher education in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine's main campus\nErie Public Schools enroll 12,527 students in primary and secondary grades.[84] The district has 23 public schools including elementary, middle, and high schools, with one charter school. Other than public schools, the city is home to more than 40 private schools and academies. Erie public schools are under frequent criticism for education quality, school rankings, and abnormally high teacher salaries.[*citation needed*]\nThe City of Erie is served by two public high schools, Erie High School and Northwest Pennsylvania Collegiate Academy, plus three Catholic high schools: Cathedral Preparatory School, Mercyhurst Preparatory School, and Villa Maria Academy.\n\n\nErie is home to several colleges and universities, including Gannon University located in downtown Erie, and Mercyhurst University in the southeast part of the city. Other notable colleges in the Erie area include Penn State Erie, The Behrend College, Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM, a large medical school), and Edinboro University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\nErie is also home to the Barber National Institute and its Elizabeth Lee Black School, which provides services and education for children and adults with mental disabilities. Erie is home to its main campus, and it provides services in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.[85] The Achievement Center also serves the needs of children from birth to age 21 with physical and mental health disabilities.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The *Erie Times-News* headquarters office\nErie is served by *Erie Times-News*, the city's daily newspaper, as well as *Erie Reader*, an alternative weekly newspaper.\n\n\nThe Nielsen Company ranks Erie as 152 out of the 210 largest television markets in the United States, as of the 2019−2020 report.[86] The market is served by stations affiliated with major American networks, including WICU-TV 12 (NBC), WJET-TV 24 (ABC), WFXP 66 (FOX), WSEE-TV 35 (CBS), and WSEE-DT2 35.2 (CW). WQLN 54 is a member station of PBS and also broadcasts toward London, Ontario. Cable companies available for Erie include Charter Spectrum, DirecTV, and Dish Network.\n\n\nErie is served by several AM and FM radio stations based in the city, and dozens of other nearby station broadcasts can be heard.\n\n\nIn August 2019, Erie was the subject of a new television show, *Undercover Billionaire*, from the Discovery Channel. In this show, a wealthy businessman, Glenn Stearns, travels to Erie under a fake name, Glenn Bryant. He starts with $100, a cell phone, and an old pickup truck. He is then asked to make a business worth over $1 million in 90 days. If he fails, he has to put $1 million of his own money into the business. Stearns makes the now prosperous business of UnderDog BBQ. Although he only gets the company valuation of around $750,000, it is still a successful business to date. He gave everyone who helped his big roles in the company's future and also invested the $1 million he owed.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The last McDonnell Douglas DC-9 to fly for US Air arriving at Erie International Airport\n![](image)Union Station is served by Amtrak's *Lake Shore Limited*\n![](image)A road map of Erie and its major routes\n![](image)Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority\nErie is well connected to the Interstate Highway System. Six \"Erie exits\" are along Interstate 90, a major cross-country thoroughfare running from Boston to Seattle. Erie is the northern terminus of Interstate 79, which travels south to Pittsburgh and, ultimately, West Virginia. The western terminus for Interstate 86, also called the \"Southern Tier Expressway\", is at Interstate 90 near Harborcreek, between Erie and North East. Interstate 86 continues east through New York to Binghamton. The Bayfront Connector runs from Interstate 90 in Harborcreek to the Bayfront Parkway and downtown Erie, along the east side of the city, then connects to Interstate 79 on the west side of the city. Major thoroughfares in the city include 12th Street, 26th Street, 38th Street, and Peach Street. Peach is also a part of U.S. Route 19, whose northern terminus is in Erie and continues south, eventually reaching the Gulf of Mexico. Other major routes running through Erie are Pennsylvania Route 5, known as the Seaway Trail and is made up of parts of 6th Street, 8th Street, 12th Street, and East Lake Road in the city, U.S. Route 20, which is 26th Street in the city. The city is divided between east and west by State Street.\n\n\nThe Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority operates the city's transit bus system, known as the 'e'. Buses run seven days a week in the city, with trips out to other parts of the county occurring a few times a week. Intercity buses providing transportation between Buffalo, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh are operated by Greyhound Lines. Service between Buffalo and Cleveland is also provided by Lakefront Lines. Both companies operate out of the Intermodal Transportation Center, which opened in 2002 at the foot of Holland Street.\n\n\nThe former \"Water Level Route\" of the New York Central Railroad travels directly through Erie. It is now the mainline for CSX freight trains. The main line of the Norfolk Southern Railway, originally built by the Nickel Plate Railroad, also travels through Erie. At one time, Norfolk Southern trains ran down the middle of 19th Street, but were removed in 2002.[87] Passenger rail service is provided by Amtrak's *Lake Shore Limited* out of Union Station at 14th and State Streets. The *Lake Shore Limited* stops twice daily—one eastbound towards New York City or Boston, and one westbound towards Chicago.\n\n\nErie International Airport and Tom Ridge Field (IATA code: ERI; ICAO code: KERI) are located 5 miles (8.0 km) west of the city and host general aviation, charter, and airline service. Destinations with nonstop flights out of Erie include Chicago O'Hare International Airport via United Airlines, Charlotte Douglas International Airport via American Airlines, and Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport via Delta Air Lines (Currently suspended). Erie International is amid an $80.5 million runway extension. The extension is slated to increase the runway's length by 1,920 ft (590 m), for a total runway length of 8,420 ft (2,600 m), \"to meet safety requirements\" and allow the airport to accommodate larger aircraft.[88]\n\n\nThe Port of Erie is located on Presque Isle Bay, a natural harbor formed by Presque Isle. It offers some of the finest port facilities for cargo shipping on the Great Lakes, with direct rail access. The Erie−Western Pennsylvania Port Authority provides water taxi service in the summer between Dobbins Landing and Liberty Park in downtown Erie, and the Waterworks ferry landing on Presque Isle.[89]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\nThe Erie Water Works, which was incorporated in 1865 as the Erie Water and Gas Company, includes a reservoir, two water-treatment plants, and an elaborate water works and pipe network that provides water for most of the city and suburbs. Penelec, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy, supplies electricity to the region, as well as the Northwestern Pennsylvania Rural Electric Cooperative. National Fuel Gas Company provides residents with natural gas. Time Warner Cable became the region's cable television provider, after taking over Adelphia, and also provides digital phone and high-speed internet to the region. Local telephone and high-speed internet service are also provided by Verizon.\n\n\nSewage service in Erie is provided by the Erie Sewer Authority, and many outlying townships have partnerships with the Sewer Authority for service. The authority cleans about 30 40×10~~^~~6 US gal (150,000 m3) of wastewater every day.[90]\n\n\nThe time and temperature number in Erie is 452-6311 and was originally discontinued by Verizon in October 2008 before being restarted by a private individual two years later.[91] The city of Erie and northwest Pennsylvania is located in area code 814. On December 16, 2010, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) voted to split the area code, which was to take effect February 1, 2012.[92] The North American Numbering Plan decided that northwest Pennsylvania would receive the new code of 582. A local grassroots coalition began organizing an opposition to the plan and generated numerous petitions for reconsideration. The PUC immediately voted to review their decision and ordered additional public-input hearings and technical conferences as a response to the strong public outcry.[93] In January 2011, the PUC announced that it was placing the entire area code split plan on hold as NEUSTAR pushed the projected exhaustion date back two years to 2015.[94]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The city currently has six fire stations and protects about 20 sq mi (52 km2). The city has five engine companies, including two rescue engines, one tower company, and one water-rescue unit. The city provides mutual aid to fire departments of Millcreek Township, Summit Township, and East County.\n\n\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\nErie has four official sister cities as designated by Sister Cities International:[96]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Dungarvan, Ireland (2007)\n* ![](image) Lublin, Poland (1998)\n* ![](image) Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico (1973)\n* ![](image) Zibo, Shandong, China (1985)\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n* List of people from Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n\n\n* USS *Erie*, at least one ship==References==\n\n\n1. **^** \"ArcGIS REST Services Directory\".

The city had a population of 95,112 at the 2020 census and is the fourth-largest city in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Allentown.[7][8][9][10] Reading is located in the southeastern part of the state and is the principal city of the Greater Reading Area, which had 420,152 residents in 2020.\n\n\nReading is part of the Delaware Valley, also known as the Philadelphia metropolitan area, a region that also includes Philadelphia, Upper Darby, Camden, Atlantic City, Wilmington, and other Philadelphia-area cities and counties. With a 2020 core metropolitan statistical area population of 6.288 million and a combined statistical area population of 7.366 million, the Delaware Valley is the nation's seventh-largest metropolitan region.\n\n\nReading gives its name to the now-defunct Reading Company, also known as the Reading Railroad, and since acquired by Conrail, that played a vital role in transporting anthracite coal from the Pennsylvania's Coal Region to major East Coast metropolitan markets through the Port of Philadelphia for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Reading Railroad is one of the four railroad properties in the classic U.S. version of the *Monopoly* board game. Reading was one of the first localities where outlet shopping became a tourist industry. It has been known as \"The Pretzel City\" because numerous local pretzel bakeries are based in the city and its suburbs; currently, Bachman, Dieffenbach, Tom Sturgis, and Unique Pretzel bakeries call the Reading area home. In recent years, the Reading area has become a destination for cyclists with more than 125 miles of trails in five major preserves; the region is an International Mountain Bicycling Association ride center.[11]\n\n\nAccording to 2010 U.S. census data, Reading had the highest share of citizens living in poverty in the nation among cities with populations exceeding 65,000.[12] Reading's poverty rate fell over the next decade.[13] Reading's poverty rate in the five-year American Community Survey, published in 2018, showed that 35.4% of the city's residents were below the poverty line, or less \"than the infamous 41.3% from 2011, when Reading was declared the poorest small city in the nation.\"[14]\n\n\nReading is located 38.8 miles (62.4 km) southwest of Allentown and 62.9 miles (101.2 km) northwest of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution\n\n![](image)The 500-block of Court Street in Downtown Reading with Berks County courthouse on the left\n![](image)Part of Reading's urbanized area in 1950\n![](image)Downtown Reading from Penn and 2nd Streets\nLenape people, also known as Delaware Indians, inhabited the Reading area prior to European settlement of the region in the 17th century. The Colony of Pennsylvania was a 1680 land grant from King Charles II of England to William Penn. Comprising more than 45,000 square miles (120,000 km2), it was named for his father, Sir William Penn.\n\n\nIn 1743, Richard and Thomas Penn, both sons of William Penn, mapped out the town of Reading with Conrad Weiser. Taking its name from Reading, Berkshire, England, the town was established in 1748. Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became the county seat. The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western Germany, who bought land from the Penns. The first Amish community in the New World was established in Greater Reading, Berks County.[15] The Pennsylvanian German dialect was spoken in the area well into the 1950s.\n\n\nDuring the French and Indian War, Reading was a military base for a chain of forts along the Blue Mountain.\n\n\nBy the time of the American Revolution, the area's iron industry had a total production exceeding England's. There were several prominent Ironmasters like Samuel Van Leer who helped supply George Washington's troops with cannons, rifles, and ammunition in the Revolutionary War.[16] During the early period of the conflict, Reading was again a depot for military supply. Hessian prisoners from the Battle of Trenton were also detained here.\n\n\nPhiladelphia was the nation's capital at the time of the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic.[17] President George Washington traveled to Reading, and considered making it the emergency national capital, but chose Germantown instead.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\nIn 1809, Susanna Cox was tried and convicted for infanticide in Reading. Her case attracted tremendous sympathy; 20,000 viewers came to view her hanging, swamping the 3,000 inhabitants.\n\n\nAccording to census data, Reading was among the nation's most-populous 100 cities in the nation from 1810 to 1950.\n\n\nThe Schuylkill Canal, a north–south canal completed in 1825, paralleled the Schuylkill River and connected Reading with Philadelphia and the Delaware River. The Union Canal, an east–west canal completed in 1828, connected the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Rivers, and ran from Reading to Middletown, Pennsylvania, a few miles south of Harrisburg, the state capital. Railroads forced the abandonment of the canals by the 1880s.\n\n\nThe naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird was born in Reading in 1823.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia and Reading Railroad (P&R) was incorporated in 1833. During the Long Depression following the Panic of 1873, a statewide railroad strike in 1877 over delayed wages led to a violent protest and clash with the National Guard in which six Reading men were killed.[18] The Reading Brewing Company was also established around this same time, and was officially chartered in 1886.[19]\n\n\nThe Charles Evans Cemetery is the non-sectarian cemetery where many of the city's prominent business and community leaders have been buried since the cemetery's opening in the 1840s. Established through the donation of land by Reading attorney and philanthropist Charles Evans and a subsequent financial endowment upon his death in 1847, which provided for future improvements to the grounds,[20] the cemetery became a primary gathering point for annual Memorial Day activities from the late 19th through the late 20th centuries due to the presence of the Grand Army of the Republic monument, which was dedicated there in 1887.[21][22][23][24]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Kodachrome slide of Reading developed in May 1983\nIn the early 20th century, the city participated in the burgeoning automobile and motorcycle industry as home to the pioneer \"Brass Era\" companies, Daniels Motor Company, Duryea Motor Wagon Company, and Reading-Standard Company.[25]\n\n\nReading experienced continuous growth until the 1930s, when its population reached nearly 120,000. From the 1940s to the 1970s, however, the city saw a sharp downturn in prosperity, largely owing to the decline of the heavy industry and railroads, on which Reading had been built, and a national trend of urban decline.\n\n\nFollowing more than a century of prosperity, the Reading Company was forced to file for bankruptcy protection in 1971. The bankruptcy was a result of dwindling coal shipping revenues and strict government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set competitive prices, required high taxes, and forced the railroads to continue to operate money-losing passenger service lines. On April 1, 1976, the Reading Company sold its current railroad interests to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad Corporation (Conrail). That same month, the Reading Brewing Company closed.[26]\nIn 1972, Hurricane Agnes caused extensive flooding in the city, not the last time the lower precincts of Reading were inundated by the Schuylkill River. A similar, though not as devastating, flood occurred during June 2006.\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2007, NBC's *Today* show featured Reading as one of the top four \"Up and Coming Neighborhoods\" in the U.S. as showing potential for a real estate boom.[27] The interviewee, Barbara Corcoran, chose the city by looking for areas of big change, renovations, cleanups of parks, waterfronts, and warehouses. Corcoran also noted Reading's proximity to Philadelphia, New York City, and other cities.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nReading is located at 40°20′30″N 75°55′35″W﻿ / ﻿40.34167°N 75.92639°W﻿ / 40.34167; -75.92639 (40.341692, −75.926301)[28] in southeastern Pennsylvania, roughly 65 miles (105 km) northwest of Philadelphia. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.1 square miles (26 km2). 9.8 square miles (25 km2) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2) of it (2.39%) is water. The city is largely bounded on the west by the Schuylkill River, on the east by Mount Penn, and on the south by Neversink Mountain. The Reading Prong, the mountain formation stretching northeast into New Jersey, has come to be associated with naturally occurring radon gas; however, homes in Reading are not particularly affected[*citation needed*]. The surrounding county is home to a number of family-owned farms.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Reading, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 3\n\n\n\n39\n\n23\n | 2.6\n\n\n\n42\n\n24\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n51\n\n32\n | 3.4\n\n\n\n63\n\n42\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n74\n\n52\n | 4.8\n\n\n\n82\n\n61\n | 4.8\n\n\n\n87\n\n66\n | 4.5\n\n\n\n84\n\n64\n | 4.9\n\n\n\n77\n\n57\n | 3.8\n\n\n\n65\n\n45\n | 3\n\n\n\n54\n\n35\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n43\n\n28\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n| Source: NOAA[29] |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Metric conversion |\n| --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 75\n\n\n\n4\n\n−5\n | 66\n\n\n\n6\n\n−4\n | 90\n\n\n\n11\n\n0\n | 85\n\n\n\n17\n\n5\n | 89\n\n\n\n23\n\n11\n | 121\n\n\n\n28\n\n16\n | 121\n\n\n\n30\n\n19\n | 114\n\n\n\n29\n\n18\n | 124\n\n\n\n25\n\n14\n | 97\n\n\n\n19\n\n7\n | 77\n\n\n\n12\n\n2\n | 89\n\n\n\n6\n\n−2\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n\n\nThe climate in and around Reading is variable, but relatively mild compared to areas further north. The Reading area falls under the southern periphery of the hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*), with areas just to the south designated as a humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen *Cfa*). Summers are warm and humid with average July highs around 86.5 °F (30.3 °C). Extended periods of heat and high humidity occur. On average, there are 27 days per year where the temperature exceeds 90 °F (32 °C). Reading becomes milder in the autumn, as the heat and humidity of summer relent to lower humidity and temperatures. The first killing frost generally occurs in late October.\n\n\nWinters bring freezing temperatures, but usually move above freezing during the day's warmest point. The average January high is 38.6 °F (3.7 °C); the average January low is 23.0 °F (−5.0 °C), but it is quite common for winter temperatures to undergo much variance from the averages. The all-time record low air temperature (not including wind chill) was −20 °F (−29 °C) during a widespread cold wave in January 1994.

The Astor, Embassy, Loew's Colonial, and Rajah Shrine Theater were grand monuments of architecture and entertainment. Today, after depression, recession, and urban renewal, the Rajah is the only one to remain. The Astor Theater was demolished in 1998 to make way for The Sovereign Center. Certain steps were taken to retain mementos of the Astor, including its ornate Art Deco chandelier and gates. These are on display and in use inside the arena corridors, allowing insight into the ambiance of the former movie house. In 2000, the Rajah was purchased from the Shriners. After a much needed restoration, it was renamed the Sovereign Performing Arts Center. In 2013 the theatre and arena were rebranded as the Santander Performing Arts Center and Santander Arena respectively after Santander Bank purchased Sovereign.\n\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic Air Museum is a membership-supported museum and restoration facility located at Carl A.

BARTA operates a fleet of 50 buses (all hybrid electric buses) serving 20 routes, mostly originating at the BARTA Transportation Center in Downtown Reading. BARTA also provides paratransit service in addition to fixed route service. The former Reading Railroad Franklin Street Station was refurbished and reopened to bus service on September 9, 2013, with buses running the express route back and forth to Lebanon Transit. The route to Lebanon was discontinued after a short period, resulting in the refurbished station sitting vacant.\n\n\nKlein Transportation provides bus service to Reading from a stop in downtown Reading and a stop at the Boscov's at the former Fairgrounds Square Mall to Douglassville, Kutztown, Wescosville, Hellertown, and Midtown Manhattan in New York City.[49] Transport Azumah provides bus service from the InterCity Bus Terminal to New York City.[50][51] Amtrak Thruway bus service operated by Krapf Coaches runs from the BARTA Transportation Center in Reading to 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, with an intermediate stop in Pottstown.[52]\n\n\nReading and the surrounding area is serviced by the Reading Regional Airport, a general aviation airfield. The three-letter airport code for Reading is RDG. Scheduled commercial airline service to Reading ended in 2004, when the last airline, USAir stopped flying into Reading.[53]\n\n\nFreight rail service in Reading is provided by the Norfolk Southern Railway, the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad, and the East Penn Railroad.[48] Norfolk Southern Railway serves Reading along the Harrisburg Line, which runs east to Philadelphia and west to Harrisburg, and the Reading Line, which runs northeast to Allentown. Norfolk Southern Railway operates the Reading Yard in Reading.[48][54] The Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad operates the Reading Division line from an interchange with the Norfolk Southern Railway in Reading north to Port Clinton and Packerton.[55] The East Penn Railroad operates the Lancaster Northern line from Sinking Spring southwest to Ephrata, using trackage rights along Norfolk Southern Railway east from Sinking Spring to an interchange with the Norfolk Southern Railway in Reading.[56]\n\n\nPassenger trains ran between Pottsville, Reading, Pottstown, and Philadelphia along the Pottsville Line until July 27, 1981, when transit operator SEPTA curtailed commuter service to electrified lines. Since then, there have been repeated calls for the resumption of the services.\n\n\nIn the late 1990s and up to 2003, SEPTA, in cooperation with Reading-based BARTA, funded a study called the Schuylkill Valley Metro which included plans to extend SEPTA's R6 passenger line to Pottstown, Reading, and Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. The project suffered a major setback when it was rejected by the Federal Transit Administration New Starts program, which cited doubts about the ridership projections and financing assumptions used by the study. With the recent surge in gasoline prices and ever-increasing traffic, the planning commissions of Montgomery County and Berks County have teamed to study the feasibility of a simple diesel shuttle train between the Manayunk/Norristown Line and Pottstown/Reading.[57] In 2018, a panel led by the Greater Reading Chamber Alliance pushed for an extension of the Manayunk/Norristown Line to Reading along existing Norfolk Southern freight railroad tracks, with service terminating either at the Franklin Street Station in Reading or in Wyomissing.[58] In 2020, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation conducted a feasibility study on passenger train service from Reading to Philadelphia.[59][60] In 2021, Amtrak announced a plan to implement intercity train service from Reading to Philadelphia and New York City, mostly following the Norfolk Southern line between Reading and Philadelphia and the Northeast Corridor between Philadelphia and New York City.[61] In April 2022, the commissions of Berks, Chester, and Montgomery County voted to establish the Schuylkill River Passenger Rail Authority to oversee the restoration of Philadelphia-Reading passenger rail service on the former Reading Railroad right-of-way.[62]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lake Ontelaunee, a primary water supplier to Reading\nElectricity in Reading is provided by Met-Ed, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy.[63][64] Natural gas service in the city is provided by UGI Utilities.[65][66] The Reading Area Water Authority provides water to the city, with the city's water supply coming from Lake Ontelaunee and the city's water treated at the Maidencreek Filter Plant.

The city had a population of 95,112 at the 2020 census and is the fourth-largest city in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Allentown.[7][8][9][10] Reading is located in the southeastern part of the state and is the principal city of the Greater Reading Area, which had 420,152 residents in 2020.\n\n\nReading is part of the Delaware Valley, also known as the Philadelphia metropolitan area, a region that also includes Philadelphia, Upper Darby, Camden, Atlantic City, Wilmington, and other Philadelphia-area cities and counties. With a 2020 core metropolitan statistical area population of 6.288 million and a combined statistical area population of 7.366 million, the Delaware Valley is the nation's seventh-largest metropolitan region.\n\n\nReading gives its name to the now-defunct Reading Company, also known as the Reading Railroad, and since acquired by Conrail, that played a vital role in transporting anthracite coal from the Pennsylvania's Coal Region to major East Coast metropolitan markets through the Port of Philadelphia for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Reading Railroad is one of the four railroad properties in the classic U.S. version of the *Monopoly* board game. Reading was one of the first localities where outlet shopping became a tourist industry. It has been known as \"The Pretzel City\" because numerous local pretzel bakeries are based in the city and its suburbs; currently, Bachman, Dieffenbach, Tom Sturgis, and Unique Pretzel bakeries call the Reading area home. In recent years, the Reading area has become a destination for cyclists with more than 125 miles of trails in five major preserves; the region is an International Mountain Bicycling Association ride center.[11]\n\n\nAccording to 2010 U.S. census data, Reading had the highest share of citizens living in poverty in the nation among cities with populations exceeding 65,000.[12] Reading's poverty rate fell over the next decade.[13] Reading's poverty rate in the five-year American Community Survey, published in 2018, showed that 35.4% of the city's residents were below the poverty line, or less \"than the infamous 41.3% from 2011, when Reading was declared the poorest small city in the nation.\"[14]\n\n\nReading is located 38.8 miles (62.4 km) southwest of Allentown and 62.9 miles (101.2 km) northwest of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution\n\n![](image)The 500-block of Court Street in Downtown Reading with Berks County courthouse on the left\n![](image)Part of Reading's urbanized area in 1950\n![](image)Downtown Reading from Penn and 2nd Streets\nLenape people, also known as Delaware Indians, inhabited the Reading area prior to European settlement of the region in the 17th century. The Colony of Pennsylvania was a 1680 land grant from King Charles II of England to William Penn. Comprising more than 45,000 square miles (120,000 km2), it was named for his father, Sir William Penn.\n\n\nIn 1743, Richard and Thomas Penn, both sons of William Penn, mapped out the town of Reading with Conrad Weiser. Taking its name from Reading, Berkshire, England, the town was established in 1748. Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became the county seat. The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western Germany, who bought land from the Penns. The first Amish community in the New World was established in Greater Reading, Berks County.[15] The Pennsylvanian German dialect was spoken in the area well into the 1950s.\n\n\nDuring the French and Indian War, Reading was a military base for a chain of forts along the Blue Mountain.\n\n\nBy the time of the American Revolution, the area's iron industry had a total production exceeding England's. There were several prominent Ironmasters like Samuel Van Leer who helped supply George Washington's troops with cannons, rifles, and ammunition in the Revolutionary War.[16] During the early period of the conflict, Reading was again a depot for military supply. Hessian prisoners from the Battle of Trenton were also detained here.\n\n\nPhiladelphia was the nation's capital at the time of the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic.[17] President George Washington traveled to Reading, and considered making it the emergency national capital, but chose Germantown instead.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\nIn 1809, Susanna Cox was tried and convicted for infanticide in Reading. Her case attracted tremendous sympathy; 20,000 viewers came to view her hanging, swamping the 3,000 inhabitants.\n\n\nAccording to census data, Reading was among the nation's most-populous 100 cities in the nation from 1810 to 1950.\n\n\nThe Schuylkill Canal, a north–south canal completed in 1825, paralleled the Schuylkill River and connected Reading with Philadelphia and the Delaware River. The Union Canal, an east–west canal completed in 1828, connected the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Rivers, and ran from Reading to Middletown, Pennsylvania, a few miles south of Harrisburg, the state capital. Railroads forced the abandonment of the canals by the 1880s.\n\n\nThe naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird was born in Reading in 1823.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia and Reading Railroad (P&R) was incorporated in 1833. During the Long Depression following the Panic of 1873, a statewide railroad strike in 1877 over delayed wages led to a violent protest and clash with the National Guard in which six Reading men were killed.[18] The Reading Brewing Company was also established around this same time, and was officially chartered in 1886.[19]\n\n\nThe Charles Evans Cemetery is the non-sectarian cemetery where many of the city's prominent business and community leaders have been buried since the cemetery's opening in the 1840s. Established through the donation of land by Reading attorney and philanthropist Charles Evans and a subsequent financial endowment upon his death in 1847, which provided for future improvements to the grounds,[20] the cemetery became a primary gathering point for annual Memorial Day activities from the late 19th through the late 20th centuries due to the presence of the Grand Army of the Republic monument, which was dedicated there in 1887.[21][22][23][24]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Kodachrome slide of Reading developed in May 1983\nIn the early 20th century, the city participated in the burgeoning automobile and motorcycle industry as home to the pioneer \"Brass Era\" companies, Daniels Motor Company, Duryea Motor Wagon Company, and Reading-Standard Company.[25]\n\n\nReading experienced continuous growth until the 1930s, when its population reached nearly 120,000. From the 1940s to the 1970s, however, the city saw a sharp downturn in prosperity, largely owing to the decline of the heavy industry and railroads, on which Reading had been built, and a national trend of urban decline.\n\n\nFollowing more than a century of prosperity, the Reading Company was forced to file for bankruptcy protection in 1971. The bankruptcy was a result of dwindling coal shipping revenues and strict government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set competitive prices, required high taxes, and forced the railroads to continue to operate money-losing passenger service lines. On April 1, 1976, the Reading Company sold its current railroad interests to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad Corporation (Conrail). That same month, the Reading Brewing Company closed.[26]\nIn 1972, Hurricane Agnes caused extensive flooding in the city, not the last time the lower precincts of Reading were inundated by the Schuylkill River. A similar, though not as devastating, flood occurred during June 2006.\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2007, NBC's *Today* show featured Reading as one of the top four \"Up and Coming Neighborhoods\" in the U.S. as showing potential for a real estate boom.[27] The interviewee, Barbara Corcoran, chose the city by looking for areas of big change, renovations, cleanups of parks, waterfronts, and warehouses. Corcoran also noted Reading's proximity to Philadelphia, New York City, and other cities.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nReading is located at 40°20′30″N 75°55′35″W﻿ / ﻿40.34167°N 75.92639°W﻿ / 40.34167; -75.92639 (40.341692, −75.926301)[28] in southeastern Pennsylvania, roughly 65 miles (105 km) northwest of Philadelphia. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.1 square miles (26 km2). 9.8 square miles (25 km2) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2) of it (2.39%) is water. The city is largely bounded on the west by the Schuylkill River, on the east by Mount Penn, and on the south by Neversink Mountain. The Reading Prong, the mountain formation stretching northeast into New Jersey, has come to be associated with naturally occurring radon gas; however, homes in Reading are not particularly affected[*citation needed*]. The surrounding county is home to a number of family-owned farms.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Reading, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 3\n\n\n\n39\n\n23\n | 2.6\n\n\n\n42\n\n24\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n51\n\n32\n | 3.4\n\n\n\n63\n\n42\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n74\n\n52\n | 4.8\n\n\n\n82\n\n61\n | 4.8\n\n\n\n87\n\n66\n | 4.5\n\n\n\n84\n\n64\n | 4.9\n\n\n\n77\n\n57\n | 3.8\n\n\n\n65\n\n45\n | 3\n\n\n\n54\n\n35\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n43\n\n28\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n| Source: NOAA[29] |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Metric conversion |\n| --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 75\n\n\n\n4\n\n−5\n | 66\n\n\n\n6\n\n−4\n | 90\n\n\n\n11\n\n0\n | 85\n\n\n\n17\n\n5\n | 89\n\n\n\n23\n\n11\n | 121\n\n\n\n28\n\n16\n | 121\n\n\n\n30\n\n19\n | 114\n\n\n\n29\n\n18\n | 124\n\n\n\n25\n\n14\n | 97\n\n\n\n19\n\n7\n | 77\n\n\n\n12\n\n2\n | 89\n\n\n\n6\n\n−2\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n\n\nThe climate in and around Reading is variable, but relatively mild compared to areas further north. The Reading area falls under the southern periphery of the hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*), with areas just to the south designated as a humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen *Cfa*). Summers are warm and humid with average July highs around 86.5 °F (30.3 °C). Extended periods of heat and high humidity occur. On average, there are 27 days per year where the temperature exceeds 90 °F (32 °C). Reading becomes milder in the autumn, as the heat and humidity of summer relent to lower humidity and temperatures. The first killing frost generally occurs in late October.\n\n\nWinters bring freezing temperatures, but usually move above freezing during the day's warmest point. The average January high is 38.6 °F (3.7 °C); the average January low is 23.0 °F (−5.0 °C), but it is quite common for winter temperatures to undergo much variance from the averages. The all-time record low air temperature (not including wind chill) was −20 °F (−29 °C) during a widespread cold wave in January 1994. Annual snowfall is variable, but averages around 25 inches (64 cm). Spring temperatures vary widely between freezing temperatures and the 80s or even 90s (around 30 °C) later in spring. The last killing frost usually is in early to mid April. Total precipitation for the entire year is 45.21 inches (114.8 cm).\n\n\nJanuary is the only month averaging below freezing while two to three months average above 22 °C (71.6 °F) and seven-months average above 50 °F (10 °C).\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Reading, PA (Reading Regional Airport) 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1888–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 77(25)\n | 82(28)\n | 88(31)\n | 97(36)\n | 96(36)\n | 102(39)\n | 106(41)\n | 105(41)\n | 102(39)\n | 94(34)\n | 84(29)\n | 77(25)\n | 106(41)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 38.6(3.7)\n | 41.9(5.5)\n | 51.0(10.6)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n | 73.5(23.1)\n | 82.0(27.8)\n | 86.5(30.3)\n | 84.4(29.1)\n | 77.1(25.1)\n | 65.4(18.6)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 43.4(6.3)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 30.8(−0.7)\n | 33.1(0.6)\n | 41.5(5.3)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 62.5(16.9)\n | 71.6(22.0)\n | 76.1(24.5)\n | 74.3(23.5)\n | 66.9(19.4)\n | 55.2(12.9)\n | 44.6(7.0)\n | 35.7(2.1)\n | 53.7(12.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 23.0(−5.0)\n | 24.4(−4.2)\n | 31.9(−0.1)\n | 41.7(5.4)\n | 51.5(10.8)\n | 61.2(16.2)\n | 65.8(18.8)\n | 64.1(17.8)\n | 56.6(13.7)\n | 45.0(7.2)\n | 35.4(1.9)\n | 28.0(−2.2)\n | 44.1(6.7)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −20(−29)\n | −13(−25)\n | −2(−19)\n | 12(−11)\n | 26(−3)\n | 36(2)\n | 43(6)\n | 39(4)\n | 30(−1)\n | 20(−7)\n | 8(−13)\n | −6(−21)\n | −20(−29)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 2.97(75)\n | 2.61(66)\n | 3.53(90)\n | 3.35(85)\n | 3.51(89)\n | 4.77(121)\n | 4.77(121)\n | 4.49(114)\n | 4.88(124)\n | 3.80(97)\n | 3.02(77)\n | 3.51(89)\n | 45.21(1,148)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 10.3\n | 10.2\n | 10.7\n | 11.6\n | 12.5\n | 12.4\n | 10.7\n | 11.2\n | 9.1\n | 10.1\n | 8.9\n | 10.8\n | 128.5\n |\n| Source: NOAA[29][30] |\n\n### Neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Area\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Center City\n | 0.381 sq. mi\n | 5,374\n |\n| Callowhill\n | 0.751 sq. mi\n | 7,289\n |\n| Centre Park\n | 0.615 sq. mi\n | 10,781\n |\n| College Heights\n | 1.295 sq. mi\n | 14,903\n |\n| East Reading\n | 2.230 sq. mi\n | 34,572\n |\n| Eastside\n | 1.849 sq. mi\n | 29,198\n |\n| Glenside\n | 2.303 sq. mi\n | 11,837\n |\n| Hampden Heights\n | 3.144 sq. mi\n | 44,101\n |\n| Millmont\n | 1.024 sq. mi\n | 5,298\n |\n| North Riverside\n | 0.955 sq. mi\n | 12,674\n |\n| Northmont\n | 0.035 sq. mi\n | 697\n |\n| Northside\n | 0.187 sq. mi\n | 1,822\n |\n| Oakbrook/Wyomissing Park\n | 1.197 sq. mi\n | 5,947\n |\n| Outlet District\n | 0.554 sq. mi\n | 14,295\n |\n| Penn's Commons\n | 0.796 sq. mi\n | 15,891\n |\n| Prince Historic District\n | 0.123 sq. mi\n | 2,002\n |\n| Queen Anne Historic District\n | 0.330 sq. mi\n | 6,359\n |\n| Southside\n | 1.486 sq. mi\n | 10,317\n |\n| South of Penn\n | 1.122 sq. mi\n | 8,483\n |\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1790 | 2,225 |  | — |\n| 1800 | 2,386 |  | 7.2% |\n| 1810 | 3,462 |  | 45.1% |\n| 1820 | 4,332 |  | 25.1% |\n| 1830 | 5,856 |  | 35.2% |\n| 1840 | 8,410 |  | 43.6% |\n| 1850 | 15,743 |  | 87.2% |\n| 1860 | 23,162 |  | 47.1% |\n| 1870 | 33,930 |  | 46.5% |\n| 1880 | 43,278 |  | 27.6% |\n| 1890 | 58,661 |  | 35.5% |\n| 1900 | 78,961 |  | 34.6% |\n| 1910 | 96,071 |  | 21.7% |\n| 1920 | 107,784 |  | 12.2% |\n| 1930 | 111,171 |  | 3.1% |\n| 1940 | 110,568 |  | −0.5% |\n| 1950 | 109,320 |  | −1.1% |\n| 1960 | 98,061 |  | −10.3% |\n| 1970 | 87,643 |  | −10.6% |\n| 1980 | 78,686 |  | −10.2% |\n| 1990 | 78,380 |  | −0.4% |\n| 2000 | 81,207 |  | 3.6% |\n| 2010 | 88,082 |  | 8.5% |\n| 2020 | 95,112 |  | 8.0% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[31] |\n\n\nAs of the 2020 United States census, Reading had a population of 95,112.

Scheduled commercial airline service to Reading ended in 2004, when the last airline, USAir stopped flying into Reading.[53]\n\n\nFreight rail service in Reading is provided by the Norfolk Southern Railway, the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad, and the East Penn Railroad.[48] Norfolk Southern Railway serves Reading along the Harrisburg Line, which runs east to Philadelphia and west to Harrisburg, and the Reading Line, which runs northeast to Allentown. Norfolk Southern Railway operates the Reading Yard in Reading.[48][54] The Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad operates the Reading Division line from an interchange with the Norfolk Southern Railway in Reading north to Port Clinton and Packerton.[55] The East Penn Railroad operates the Lancaster Northern line from Sinking Spring southwest to Ephrata, using trackage rights along Norfolk Southern Railway east from Sinking Spring to an interchange with the Norfolk Southern Railway in Reading.[56]\n\n\nPassenger trains ran between Pottsville, Reading, Pottstown, and Philadelphia along the Pottsville Line until July 27, 1981, when transit operator SEPTA curtailed commuter service to electrified lines. Since then, there have been repeated calls for the resumption of the services.\n\n\nIn the late 1990s and up to 2003, SEPTA, in cooperation with Reading-based BARTA, funded a study called the Schuylkill Valley Metro which included plans to extend SEPTA's R6 passenger line to Pottstown, Reading, and Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. The project suffered a major setback when it was rejected by the Federal Transit Administration New Starts program, which cited doubts about the ridership projections and financing assumptions used by the study. With the recent surge in gasoline prices and ever-increasing traffic, the planning commissions of Montgomery County and Berks County have teamed to study the feasibility of a simple diesel shuttle train between the Manayunk/Norristown Line and Pottstown/Reading.[57] In 2018, a panel led by the Greater Reading Chamber Alliance pushed for an extension of the Manayunk/Norristown Line to Reading along existing Norfolk Southern freight railroad tracks, with service terminating either at the Franklin Street Station in Reading or in Wyomissing.[58] In 2020, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation conducted a feasibility study on passenger train service from Reading to Philadelphia.[59][60] In 2021, Amtrak announced a plan to implement intercity train service from Reading to Philadelphia and New York City, mostly following the Norfolk Southern line between Reading and Philadelphia and the Northeast Corridor between Philadelphia and New York City.[61] In April 2022, the commissions of Berks, Chester, and Montgomery County voted to establish the Schuylkill River Passenger Rail Authority to oversee the restoration of Philadelphia-Reading passenger rail service on the former Reading Railroad right-of-way.[62]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lake Ontelaunee, a primary water supplier to Reading\nElectricity in Reading is provided by Met-Ed, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy.[63][64] Natural gas service in the city is provided by UGI Utilities.[65][66] The Reading Area Water Authority provides water to the city, with the city's water supply coming from Lake Ontelaunee and the city's water treated at the Maidencreek Filter Plant. The Reading Water Company was founded in 1821 to supply water to the city. The Reading Area Water Authority was established on May 20, 1994, to take over the water system in the city.[67] Sewer service is provided by the city's Public Works department, with a wastewater treatment plant owned by the city located on Fritz Island.[68] The city's Public Works department provides trash and recycling collection to Reading.[69]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nHospitals serving the Reading area include Reading Hospital in West Reading and Penn State Health St. Joseph in Bern Township and downtown Reading. Reading Hospital offers an emergency department with a Level I trauma center and various services including Cancer Care, Heart Center, Orthopedic Services, Pediatrics, Primary Care, and Women's Health.[70] Penn State Health St. Joseph offers an emergency department, heart institute, cancer center, stroke center, wound center, orthopedics, and primary care physicians.[71]\n\n\n\n### Fire department[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Reading Fire Department\n\n![](image)Reading Fire Museum\nThe city of Reading is protected by the 135 firefighters and paramedics of the Reading Fire and EMS Department (RFD). The RFD operates out of seven fire stations throughout the city. The RFD operates a fire apparatus fleet of five Engine Companies, three Ladder Companies, one Rescue Company, brush unit, and four front-line Medic Ambulances. In 2018, fire units responded to 9,992 incidents. EMS responses totaled 19,505 calls for service.[*citation needed*] Department staffing is only two firefighters per apparatus.[72]\n\n\n\n## In media[edit]\n\n\nThe book and movie *Rabbit, Run* and the other three novels of the *Rabbit* series by John Updike were set in fictionalized versions of Reading and nearby Shillington, called Brewer and Olinger respectively. Updike was born in Reading and lived in nearby Shillington until he was thirteen. He also makes reference to the Brewer suburb of Mount Judge, equivalent to Mount Penn, east of Reading.\n\n\nThe play *Sweat* by Lynn Nottage is set in Reading.[73][74]\n\n\nThe movie *Goon: Last of the Enforcers* features Reading as the home of the rival team, the Reading Wolf Dogs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn season nine, episode four of the sitcom, Seinfeld, the character George Costanza (Jason Alexander) lies that Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is moving to Reading, Pennsylvania to live with her grandparents.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain category: People from Reading, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)*David McMurtrie Gregg*, an Augustus Lukeman erected in 1922\n* Gus Alberts (1861–1912), Major League Baseball player[75]\n* Coit Albertson (1880–1953), Silent Film actor\n* George Warren Alexander (1829–1903), US Army officer and founder of G.W.
