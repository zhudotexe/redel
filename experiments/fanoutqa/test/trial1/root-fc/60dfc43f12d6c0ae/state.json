The criterion for inclusion is to sell at least ten million copies worldwide. The singles listed here were cited by reliable sources from various media, such as digital journalism, newspapers, magazines, and books.\n\n\nAccording to *Guinness World Records*, Irving Berlin's \"White Christmas\" (1942) as performed by Bing Crosby is the best-selling single worldwide, with estimated sales of over 50 million copies.[1] The song, recognized as \"the best-selling single of all time\", was released before the pop/rock singles-chart era and \"was listed as the world's best-selling single in the first-ever *Guinness Book of Records* (published in 1955) and\u2014remarkably\u2014still retains the title more than 50 years later\". *Guinness World Records* also states that double A-side charity single \"Candle in the Wind 1997\"/\"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\" (1997) by Elton John (rewritten as a tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales, rather than Marilyn Monroe in the original 1973 version), is \"the biggest-selling single since UK and US singles charts began in the 1950s, having accumulated worldwide sales of 33 million copies\". This makes it the second-best-selling physical single of all time.[1]\n\n\nTwo best-selling singles lists are displayed here relating first to physical singles (mainly CD and vinyl singles) and second to digital singles (digitally downloaded tracks which first became available to purchase in the early 2000s).\n\n\n\n\n## Best-selling physical singles[edit]\n\n\n### 15\u00a0million physical copies

At midnight on 25 April 2020, Xiao Zhan updated his Weibo, shared the single's cover art, and wrote: \"I'll bear everything that has happened in mind. Thanks for all the well-intentioned criticism and corrections. Growing on the way.\"[8] Accompanying this announcement, he also changed his Weibo profile picture, which he had been using for four years, to a picture of the single's cover art.[9] Soon afterwards, Xiao Zhan's studio released the new song \"Spotlight\". The song became available for download on Tencent Music's services QQ Music, KuGou, and Kuwo\u00a0[zh].[4]\n\n\nThe song was seen as a response to the Boycott against Xiao Zhan Incident.[10][4]\n\n\n\n## Sales[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xiao Zhan in January 2020\nThe single was released online on 25 April 2020 and sold at a price of 3 RMB. On the day of its release, it sold 24,370,000 copies, grossing 73,130,000 RMB and surpassing Cai Xukun's album YOUNG\u00a0[zh] (which was released on 26 July 2019 at a price of 5 RMB, and sold 13,350,000 copies for a total of 66,740,000 RMB).[9] On its second day it surpassed 25 million copies, a record.[11][12] The single reached the top of QQ Music's annual bestseller list, QQ Music's list of top new songs, and Tencent's \"up to you\" list (\u7531\u4f60\u97f3\u4e50\u699c).[1] It was reported that on 25 April, \"Xiao Zhan's worldwide fan club\" was the biggest buyer on QQ Music, with 9,088,000 digital album purchases.[4] On 28 April, album sales surpassed 100 million RMB.[13]\n\n\n\"Spotlight\" became the most-downloaded song and the highest-grossing digital single in Chinese music history.[7][14] The single's sales by 26 April broke the Guinness World Record for the fastest-selling digital track in China.[15] The Tencent Music Entertainment Awards named it the most popular digital single of 2020.[16] It was listed seventh on IFPI's international list of the 10 bestselling singles of the year[17] and on Guinness World Records' list of 2020's most streamed tracks with 1.48 billion subscription stream equivalents.[18]\n\n\nFans encouraged each other to buy multiple copies of the song as a show of support for Xiao Zhan; they saw the single as an opportunity for Xiao Zhan to improve his reputation amid the ongoing controversy.[6][19] This boosted the single's sales, with fans reportedly buying an average of close to 66 copies each.[11][6] The mass-purchasing campaign was controversial enough that Xiao Zhan's agency posted on Weibo reminding fans to focus on their other priorities in life.[6]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nOn 26 April 2022, it was reported that after the single's release, its rating on Douban reached 7.5 out of 10; it \"received praise from critics in the music industry and got a bumper harvest in both sales and word of mouth\".[1] The single's Douban rating was volatile: it rose to 10 points out of 10, then dropped to 3.2 out of 10, with reviews from 48,000 Douban users.[5] The rating later rose back to 6. At noon on 26 April, the single's rating was 5.7, with reviews from more than 75,000 users, among which 54.6% had given 5-star reviews and 30.3% had given 1-star reviews. Together, these polarized ratings represented 84.8% of the single's reviewers.[5]\n\n\nSupporters say that the lyrics and Xiao Zhan's singing are excellent, and that Xiao Zhan handled the R&B riffs well. Opponents say that \"Spotlight\" is a typical example of an assembly-line product of the idol industry, that its melody is comfortable but has no personality, and that the lyrics are cliched.[5] According to an analysis in *National Business Daily*, \"Most fans' line of thinking is, 'Maybe his singing isn't the best, but it does make you want to support him'.\"[20]\n\n\n\n## Charts[edit]\n\n\n\n\nChart performance for \"Made to Love\"\n| Chart (2022)\n | Peakposition\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hungary (Single Top 40)[21] | 26\n |\n| Japan Download Songs (*Billboard Japan*)[22] | 61\n |\n| US World Digital Song Sales (*Billboard*)[23] | 5\n |\n\n\n### Year-end charts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2020 year-end chart performance for \"Made To Love\"\n| Chart (2020)\n | Position\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Worldwide (*IFPI*)[24] | 7\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Anti-boycott\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Also translated \"Spot Light\", \"Spot of Light\", \"Light Spot\", \"Light\", \"Guang Dian\", or \"Made to Love\"; simplified Chinese: \u5149\u70b9; traditional Chinese: \u5149\u9ede; pinyin: *Gu\u0101ngdi\u01cen*.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \u4efb\u82af\u4eea, ed.

It was released on 6 January 2017 as one of the double lead singles from his third studio album *\u00f7* (2017), along with \"Castle on the Hill\". The dancehall and R&B-infused pop song was written by Sheeran, Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid. Due to its interpolation of \"No Scrubs\" by TLC, Kandi Burruss, Tameka \"Tiny\" Cottle, and Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs are also credited as writers. The song was produced by Sheeran and Mac.\n\n\n\"Shape of You\" peaked at number one on the singles charts of 34 countries, including the US *Billboard* Hot 100 (later becoming the best performing song of 2017), as well as the UK, Australian and Canadian singles charts. It stayed at number one for a record-tying 16 consecutive weeks on the Canadian Hot 100, as well as 14 nonconsecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart, and 12 non-consecutive weeks on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\nOn 10 December 2018, the song became the first song to hit 2\u00a0billion streams on Spotify and is currently the 2nd most streamed song on the platform with 3.6 billion streams, behind \"Blinding Lights\" by the Weeknd. It was also the most-streamed song of the decade on Spotify with 2.4\u00a0billion streams by December 2019, and the most streamed song on Apple Music with 930 million streams, as of May 2023. It was the best-selling song of 2017 and the decade in the UK. \"Shape of You\" was the best-selling song of 2017 and the second best-selling digital song worldwide, with combined sales and track-equivalent streams of 26.6\u00a0million units according to IFPI.[2]\n\n\nIn 2018, it sold an additional 14.9\u00a0million copies, combining a total of 41.5\u00a0million copies worldwide with the previous total sales figure, making it one of the best selling digital singles of all time. Additionally, it made a second appearance in the *Billboard* year-end chart in 2018, at No. 71.[3] In 2019, it was named the number-one song on the *Billboard* Mainstream Top 40 chart of the 2010s decade.[4] \"Shape of You\" was nominated for British Single of the Year and British Video of the Year at the 2018 Brit Awards.[5] The song won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards.[6] In 2021, *Billboard* ranked \"Shape of You\" as the tenth most successful song of all-time.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nThe song was the last song written for Sheeran's third album *\u00f7*.[8] As he had recently written all the songs he wanted for the album, the song was therefore not intended to be included in the album. It was conceived as a duet between Rihanna and Rudimental, but the head of the record label convinced him to keep the song for himself.[9] He said:\n\n\n\n\n>  \"['Shape of You'] is actually a really random one because I went in to write songs for other people with a guy called Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid, and we were writing this song and I was like 'this would really work for Rihanna,'\" he explained. \"And then I started singing lyrics like 'putting Van the Man on the jukebox' and I was like 'well she's not really going to sing that, is she?' And then we sort of decided halfway through that we were just going to make it for me.\"[10]\n> \n> \n\n\nAccording to Sheeran, Steve Mac started the songwriting session by playing the opening notes of the song on the keyboard. Sheeran then joined in, adding percussion by tapping on the guitar, layering it onto the track. On the writing of the song, he said that he tried to keep the music \"more stripped\" instead of something more elaborate: \"I'm an acoustic artist, first and foremost. And when I play live, I can't replicate these things, I haven't got all the other musicians.\" Sheeran said he wanted an R&B feel to the song, therefore he adjusted the original tune, adding an interpolation of \"No Scrubs\" onto part of the melody. He also revealed that the original lyrics did not end with the words \"the shape of you\" in the chorus, but during the writing of the song, McDaid thought that the lyrics \"I'm in love with your body\" sounded objectifying, and the lyrics was therefore adjusted.[11][9] In a March 2023 interview with *Rolling Stone*, Sheeran revealed that he had attempted to get a Jay-Z guest verse; however, the American rapper declined, stating that he \"doesn't think the song needs a rap verse\".[12]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\nOn 6 January 2017, when hosting *The Radio 1 Breakfast Show*, Sheeran revealed that \"Shape of You\" was written with Rihanna in mind.[13][14] On 4 January 2017, Sheeran uploaded a six-second teaser video of a blue background to social media, with lyrics \"the club isn't the best place to find a lover\", which is the first line of \"Shape of You\". To further tease the release, Sheeran and his label used a sponsored Snapchat lens filter with 30 seconds of the song to increase buzz among the general public.[15]\n\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\n\"Shape of You\" has been characterised as pop,[16] dancehall,[17][18] and tropical house,[19] with \"strummy acoustics.\"[20] \"Shape of You\" is written in the key of C\u266f minor with a tempo of 96 beats per minute. The song is composed in common time (**4**  \n**4** time), and follows a basic chord progression of C\u266fm\u2013F\u266fm\u2013A\u2013B (i\u2013iv\u2013VI\u2013VII), and Sheeran's vocals span from G\u266f3 to G\u266f5.[21] It has a tresillo rhythm.[22]\n\n\nIn the song, Sheeran sings over a marimba-fueled percussive sway about a budding romance: \"The club isn't the best place to find a lover, so the bar is where I go/ Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow\", he sings. \"Come over and start up a conversation with just me/ And trust me I'll give it a chance.\"[23][24] According to *NT News*, the song \"tells the story of loved (or lusted) up Sheeran meeting a girl in a bar where he and his mates are doing shots.\"[25]\n\n\nThe song's lyrical rhythm drew some comparisons to the 1999 TLC hit \"No Scrubs\", particularly in the pre-chorus line, \"Boy, let's not talk too much/ Grab on my waist and put that body on me\". Kandi Burruss had told Bravo\u2019s Andy Cohen that the negotiations had started before the song's release for its interpolation but weren't finalized until afterwards. As a result, the composers of \"No Scrubs\", Kandi Burruss, Tameka \"Tiny\" Cottle, and Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs, received co-writing credits on \"Shape of You\".[26]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nJon Caramanica from *The New York Times* said, \"'Shape of You' is trickier, a nimble and effective song that takes the aggressive thinning of 'Caribbean music'.\"[27] *Billboard*'s Taylor Weatherby wrote about the song saying, \"'Shape of You' doesn't quite sound like your typical Sheeran tune. But that almost serves as an indication of what the 'Thinking Out Loud' singer has been up to during his hiatus: creating music that still feels like Sheeran, just with a new twist.\"[28] Jeremy Gordon of *Spin* gave the song a positive review, stating that the song \"is a plausible attempt at convincing us he has had sex ... a lot of it. It kind of slaps, though you can't really picture Sheeran ever saying 'put that body on me' to a real human woman.\"[29] *Entertainment Weekly* gave the song a B+ rating,[30] and *Rolling Stone* ranked the song at number 13 on its \"50 best songs of 2017\" list.[31] *USA Today* ranked it at number 36 of 2017 singles.[32]\n\n\n*Uproxx* ranked the song at number 3 on its \"The Worst Songs Of 2017\" list: \"The contrarian in me is always tempted to defend Ed Sheeran, because it's way too easy to take shots at this guy... Then I hear the part in 'Shape Of You' where he says, 'And last night you were in my room / And now my bedsheets smell like you.' And now I want to push him into a locker.\"[33] *Spin* and *Esquire* listed it as one of the worst songs of 2017.[34][35] In 2022, *Far Out* placed it on its \"The 10 worst songs to have spent 10 weeks at Number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100\" list.[36]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\n\"Shape of You\" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 13 January 2017, selling 227,000 combined units in its first week and becoming Sheeran's third UK number one. Sheeran also debuted at number two with the song \"Castle on the Hill\", making him the first artist in UK chart history to debut in the top two positions simultaneously.[37] It spent 13 consecutive weeks at number one,[38] and a further week at the top after a week's interruption by Harry Styles' \"Sign of the Times\".[39] In July 2017, the song reached 184 million in streams, making it the most-streamed song in the UK of all time.[40] It was the nation's highest selling and most streamed track of 2017 with 787,000 copies sold and 248\u00a0million streams throughout the year, to produce a combined sales of 3.2\u00a0million.[41] In September 2020, the track was certified eight-times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).[42] \"Shape of You\" is Sheeran's best-selling single in the UK with total sales of 5.09 million units as of July 2021, according to the Official Charts Company.[43]\n\n\nThe song debuted at number one on the *Billboard* Hot 100, selling 240,000 downloads and gaining 20 million streams in its debut week in the US, becoming Sheeran's first number one song in the country.[44] Sheeran also became the first artist to debut two songs in the top 10 the same week in the history of the Hot 100, with \"Castle on the Hill\" also debuting at number six.[44] \"Shape of You\" topped the Hot 100 for 12 non-consecutive weeks.[45] In its fourth week at number one, the song also topped the Mainstream Top 40, becoming Sheeran's second number-one single on the chart (after 2015's \"Thinking Out Loud\"). On 6 May 2017, it fell to number two on the Hot 100, being displaced by Kendrick Lamar's \"Humble\".[46] On the issue date, 2 September 2017, \"Shape of You\" spent its 32nd week in the top ten of Hot 100, tying the record for the most weeks on that chart with LeAnn Rimes' \"How Do I Live\" and the Chainsmokers' \"Closer\" featuring Halsey.[47] The following week, \"Shape of You\" spent its 33rd consecutive week in the top 10, breaking the 20-year-old record. This record would be tied twice and eventually broken in 2020 by Post Malone's \"Circles.\"[48] On *Billboard*'s Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart, \"Shape of You\" became Sheeran's first number one on a Dance/EDM chart (his third top ten and sixth overall at Dance/Mix Show Airplay) in the United States.[49] Afterwards, the song topped Dance Club Songs in its 18 March 2017 issue, his first as a solo artist and his second entry on this chart, when he was a featured artist on Rudimental's \"Lay It All on Me\", which peaked at No. 38 in 2016.[50][51] By August 2017, \"Shape of You\" was the best selling song of 2017 in the US with 2.3\u00a0million copies sold, the only one to sell over two million. It is also the most streamed song with 799.7\u00a0million combined audio and video streams.[47] The song became the number one song of the year on *Billboard* Hot 100 in 2017,[52] and the second best-selling song in the US after \"Despacito\" with over 2.5\u00a0million copies sold.[53]\n\n\nIt debuted at number one in France,[54] and was later certified diamond there.[55] According to Pure Charts, in the first half of the year 2017, the song reached 631,000 units (105,000 sales and 526,000 units from streams) and as of September 2017, it exceeds 812,109 units (707,109 from streams).[56] It was the best-selling song (including streaming) in France this year.[57] In Australia, the song stayed at No. 1 for 15 weeks, breaking a record set 22 years ago by Coolio's \"Gangsta's Paradise\".[58] In doing this, it also broke ABBA's record of fourteen weeks at number one, which was set on the previous Australian charts before the ARIA charts became Australia's official charts.[59] \"Shape of You\" was also Australia's highest selling song of 2017 with 630,000 copies sold by the end of the year.[60] The song is the first ever number one single of the now-defunct Philippine Hot 100 upon the chart's inception on 12 June 2017.[61] It stayed at the peak position for 4 consecutive weeks before it was dethroned by \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWorldwide, the song reached one billion streams on Spotify in June 2017.[62][63] It became the most streamed song on Spotify in September 2017, reaching 1,318,420,396 streams overtaking Drake's \"One Dance\".[64] It became the first song to reach 2 billions in streams on Spotify in 2018,[65] and it was the most-streamed song of the decade on Spotify, with 2.4\u00a0billion streams in the 2010s.[66] On 22 December 2021, \"Shape of You\" became Spotify's first song to hit 3\u00a0billion streams.[67] In May 2023, Apple Music announced that \"Shape of You\" was the most-streamed song on the platform, with over 930 million streams.[68][69]\n\n\nIn August 2018, *Billboard* published a new edition of the \"Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Singles\" chart, its list of the 100 best-performing songs in the history of the Hot 100. \"Shape of You\" was ranked at number nine, the third-highest position of any song released in the 2010s (behind only \"Uptown Funk\" by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars and \"Party Rock Anthem\" by LMFAO featuring Lauren Bennett and GoonRock).[70]\n\n\nOn November 23, 2021, *Billboard* published an updated edition of the \"Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Singles\" chart from 2018 where \"Shape of You\" is currently ranked the #10 Greatest Hot 100 Hit of All Time following the induction of the Weeknd's 2019 single \"Blinding Lights\" which currently holds the #1 position.[71]\n\n\n\n## Copyright trial[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Sheeran was taken to court by musicians Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue who allege \"Shape of You\" infringes \"particular lines and phrases\" of their 2015 composition \"Oh Why\".[72][73] Sheeran and his co-writers, Steven McCutcheon and John McDaid, have been barred by music licensing body PRS for Music from collecting an estimated \u00a320m in royalties from the performances or broadcasts of \"Shape of You\". Legal proceedings began in May 2018, with Sheeran and his co-writers asking the high court to declare they had not infringed Chokri and O'Donoghue's copyright. Two months later, Chokri and O'Donoghue issued their own claim for \"copyright infringement, damages and an account of profits in relation to the alleged infringement\".[74]\n\n\nOn 6 April 2022, the judge ruled that Sheeran had \"neither deliberately nor subconsciously copied\" Chokri's song. While there were \"similarities between the one-bar phrase\", the judge said that \"differences between the relevant parts\" of the songs were \"compelling evidence that the 'Oh I' phrase\" in Sheeran's song \"originated from sources other than Oh Why\".[75] After the win, Sheeran said: \"I feel like claims like this are way too common now and have become a culture where a claim is made with the idea that a settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there's no basis for the claim. It's really damaging to the songwriting industry. There's only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music. Coincidence is bound to happen if 60,000 songs are being released every day on Spotify. That's 22 million songs a year, and there's only 12 notes that are available.\"[76]\n\n\n\n## Lyric video[edit]\n\n\nOn 5 January 2017, to accompany the song's release, a lyric video for \"Shape of You\" was released on Sheeran's YouTube channel with \"Castle on the Hill\".[77] As of April 2022, the official lyric video has had 914 million views on YouTube.[78]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\n### Release[edit]\n\n\nOn 30 January 2017, the official music video of the song, paying homage to the Rocky films, starring US dancer and model Jennie Pegouskie and retired professional sumo wrestler Yamamotoyama Ry\u016bta (credited as \"Yama\"), was released on Sheeran's channel.[79][80] It was shot in Seattle, and was directed by Jason Koenig, who also directed Sheeran's fourth single \"Perfect\" from *\u00f7*.[81]\n\n\n\n### Synopsis[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

As the song begins, we see Sheeran shadowboxing while Pegouskie is already at the gym ready for the workout. She hangs herself at the punching bag doing sit-up and stretches herself. A little while later, Pegouskie shadowboxes and punches a punching bag when Sheeran lately arrives at the training carrying a bag with him. After Sheeran places his bag at the closet, he proceeds to train himself for his upcoming match trained by a personal trainer along with Pegouskie who still warms herself up. Later, Sheeran and Pegouskie head out of the gym towards a restaurant while bonding each other. Upon arriving, the couple eat and share foods like canoodling over a fried chicken as they have an intimate conversation with each other, although their dialogue is entirely mute. Afterwards, Sheeran and his girlfriend ride a taxi and make out at the back seat while the taxi driver does not notice this as he is focusing on driving. Back at the gym, Sheeran and Pegouskie physically trained hard doing various training exercises. While training, the couple embraced each other and teach one other, eventually falling in love with each other in the process. Later, Pegouskie leaves a picture and a box to Sheeran in a closet and seemingly abandons him. The scene cuts back to Sheeran who discovers a picture and a black box both seen earlier with the latter containing a blue mouthguard featuring a **\"\u00f7\"** symbol at the front. Realizing that his girlfriend had left him (unbeknownst to him, she already is at a passenger ship), He starts to search for her to no avail. In response to her disappointing departure, Sheeran lets out his frustration and proceeds to an intense workout that includes tire-flipping, shadowboxing, sit-up, running and push-up. Later, Sheeran participates a match he has anticipated throughout the clip but he unexpectedly encounters a Rikishi or a sumo wrestler (Yamamotoyama Ry\u016bta), much to his shock. During the match, Sheeran is seen almost always avoiding Yama who constantly chases him and the latter fails to defeat the Rikishi. Sheeran ends up getting defeated and is thrown at the edge of the ring, crying in agony with the crowd encouraging him to stand up. Towards the end of the video, Yama wins the match but Pegouskie emerges the scene among the crowd flying into the ring with a karate kick in the air aiming towards Yama as the scene cuts to black with the text that reads \u201cDIRECTED BY: JASON KOENIG\u201d. Sheeran is last seen at the end of the music video struggling to get up while lying down on the floor, but he fails to do so.\n\n\n\n### Reception[edit]\n\n\nOn 8 May 2017, 97 days after its release, it became one of the fastest music videos to reach 1\u00a0billion views on YouTube, and as of April 2023, the music video has over 6\u00a0billion views on the site and is the site's fifth most-watched video as well as the second most-watched music video.[82]\n\n\n\n## Live performances[edit]\n\n\nSheeran performed \"Shape of You\" on *Saturday Night Live* on 11 February 2017 and at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards the following day.[83][84] On 27 February, Sheeran performed the song on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon*, with Fallon and The Roots, who used classroom instruments.[85] On 6 July, Sheeran performed the track on US breakfast television show *Today*.[86] On 27 August, Sheeran performed \"Shape of You\" at 2017 MTV Video Music Awards in a medley with Lil Uzi Vert and his song \"XO Tour Llif3\".[87] At the NRJ Music Awards 2017 on 4 November, he performed \"Shape of You\" in a medley with Soprano and his song \"Fresh Prince\".\n\n\n\n## Remixes and covers[edit]\n\n\nThe official remix of \"Shape of You\" features newly additional verses and guest vocals by English grime artist Stormzy. The remix premiered during Sheeran and Stormzy's live collaboration at the 2017 Brit Awards at The O2 in London on 22 February 2017.\n[88]\n\n\nSheeran announced on Twitter that the remix would be released officially on 24 February 2017.[89] On the same date, various remixes of the song were released on digital music services. Sheeran teased the releases ahead of 2017 Brit Awards ceremony. \"I've got two things dropping on Friday that are pretty interesting\", he revealed in a BBC Radio 1 interview just hours before the big show. \"One that gets debuted at the Brits, which I think people will go a bit nuts for.\" He added, \"It's something that I think nobody is expecting. I think it'll be decent.\"[90]\n\n\nMajor Lazer released his own remix entitled \"Shape of You (Major Lazer Remix)\" on 27 February 2017. It featured vocals by the Jamaican singer Nyla and the Jamaican reggae and dancehall artist Kranium.\n\n\nIn the United States, \"Shape of You\" has immediately become a favourite among DJs and remixers, prompting several of them to create their own versions. One DJ, Joe \"Maz\" Masurka, told *Billboard* that after he did his own remix on the single that he received a lot of great feedback and response: \"... the dance floor loves it.\"[91]\n\n\nIn September 2018, Ndlovu Youth Choir and Wouter Kellerman released \"Shape of You\" in Zulu version.[92]\n\n\n\n## In other media[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2017, a Walsall woman Sonia Bryce was imprisoned for two months for noise pollution after repeatedly playing \"Shape of You\" at a high volume.[93][94] English singer Charli XCX performed \"Shape of You\" in drag as Sheeran on the US television series *Lip Sync Battle* in March 2018.[95] The song is featured on the dance rhythm game, *Just Dance 2018*. It was featured and remixed in *YouTube Rewind: The Shape of 2017*.[96] The song is also used in an episode in the French version of *Skam*.[97] Pentatonix covered the song as a mash-up with \"Despacito\" for their 2018 album *PTX Presents: Top Pop, Vol. I*.[98][*non-primary source needed*] Likewise, the song was covered by Hawaiian ukulele artist Jake Shimabukuro for his 2018 album, *The Greatest Day*.[99] The song appears often in the Japanese drama \u50d5\u305f\u3061\u304c\u3084\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f(We Did It/Fugitive Boys).[100][*non-primary source needed*][101] M&S used the song in their food adverts from 2017 to 2019.

The video amassed three million views.[102] \"Shape of You\" has also been referenced in Doja Cat's \"Get Into It (Yuh)\", from the album *Planet Her* (2021).\n\n\n\n## Formats and track

It has received Latin Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Urban Fusion/Performance, and Best Short Form Music Video at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards. \"Despacito\" has been also ranked among the best Latin songs of all time and the best songs of 2017 by various publications, which referred to it as one of the most successful Spanish-language tracks in pop music history.\n\n\nThe song topped the charts of 47 countries and reached the top 10 of six others. In the United States, it became the first song primarily in Spanish to top the *Billboard* Hot 100 since Los del R\u00edo's \"Macarena\" in 1996, subsequently tying the longest-reigning number one on the *Billboard* Hot 100 at the time with 16 weeks, as well as becoming the longest-running number-one on the Hot Latin Songs chart with 56 weeks. It also became the first Latin song to receive a diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. The music video shows both artists performing the song in La Perla neighborhood of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico and local bar La Factor\u00eda. It was the most-viewed YouTube video of all time from August 2017 to November 2020 and became the first video on the site to reach the milestones of three, four, five, six, seven, and eight billion views. It is now the second most-viewed video on the site, with \"Baby Shark\" by Pinkfong being the most-viewed.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Original version[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender (*pictured*) co-wrote the song.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Despacito\" were written in late 2015 in Luis Fonsi's house in Miami because he wanted to record a \"swinging song\" for his new album after two years without releasing new music.[3][4] He woke up mulling about \"a song called 'Despacito'\" and invited Brazilian-Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender to a songwriting session.[5] Fonsi co-wrote the song on a Gibson Emmylou Harris guitar.[6] He originally composed it as a cumbia and pop song with lyrics written as a ballad but decided to give it an \"urban injection\" and sent a demo to reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee.[4] They recorded the song at Noisematch Studios in Miami in late 2016.[7][8] Daddy Yankee improvised his verse in a corner of the studio's control room while thinking about his father playing bongos and wrote the post-chorus.[8][9] It was produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andr\u00e9s Torres; the former is known as a member of Colombian pop duo Cali y El Dandee and the latter is known for previously working with David Bisbal, Thal\u00eda, and Ricky Martin.[10][11] It was mixed by American engineer Jaycen Joshua at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles.[12]\n\n\nLuis Fonsi does not consider it a reggaeton song but feels that \"it does have a reggaeton energy and an subtle urban beat\".[4] Ender stated that the track \"went through several arrangements\" until Fonsi got \"exactly the arrangement he wanted\".[5] Fonsi described \"Despacito\" as a very melodic song that can adapt well to many other music genres.[13] Due to the sensual nature of the song, they \"needed to be responsible with a good lyric\" and Ender's approach to writing for Fonsi was \"to take care of how to say things with a good taste\".[3] In April 2017, American singer and songwriter Nicky Jam revealed that the original version of \"Despacito\" featured him instead of Daddy Yankee, but had to decline due to the song's release interfering with the launch of his album *F\u00e9nix*.[14]\n\n\n\n### Justin Bieber remix version[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| \"Despacito (remix)\" |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Single by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber |\n| from the album  *Vida*  |\n| Language | * Spanish\n* English\n |\n| Released | April 17, 2017 |\n| Recorded | April 13, 2017 |\n| Studio | * Noisematch (Miami, U.S.)\n* Audiovisi\u00f3n (Bogot\u00e1, Colombia)\n |\n| Genre | * Reggaeton\n* Latin pop\n |\n| Length | 3:48 |\n| Label | * Republic\n* RBMG\n* Def Jam\n* School Boy\n |\n| Songwriter(s) | * Rodr\u00edguez\n* Ender\n* Ayala\n* Justin Bieber\n* Jason Boyd\n* Marty James\n |\n| Producer(s) | * Rengifo\n* Torres\n* Josh Gudwin\n |\n| Luis Fonsi singles chronology |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \"Wave Your Flag\" (2017)\n | \"**Despacito (remix)**\" (2017)\n | \"Kissing Strangers (remix)\" (2017)\n |\n\n |\n|  |\n| Daddy Yankee singles chronology |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \"Despacito\"(2017)\n | \"**Despacito (remix)**\"(2017)\n | \"Vuelve\"(2017)\n |\n\n |\n| Justin Bieber singles chronology |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \"Deja Vu\"(2016)\n | \"**Despacito (remix)**\"(2017)\n | \"I'm the One\"(2017)\n |\n\n |\n| Remix audio |\n| \"Despacito (remix)\" on YouTube |\n|  |\n\n\nThree months after the release of \"Despacito\", Canadian singer Justin Bieber wanted to record a remix version after hearing the song in a Colombian nightclub during a tour in South America.[15] The following day, Luis Fonsi received a phone call from Universal Latin about the intentions for remix and authorized the label to send the track to Bieber.[16] Bieber's manager Scooter Braun contacted his vocal producer Josh Gudwin to work on the song, who flew to Bogot\u00e1 and recorded Justin Bieber's vocals at Estudios Audiovisi\u00f3n.[17]\n\n\nJustin Bieber sang in Spanish for the first time in his career with the help of Colombian musician Juan Felipe Samper.[18][19] What was most difficult for Justin Bieber was the 'ere' (\u027e) sound in words like \"laberinto\" (labyrinth), \"paredes\" (walls) and \"manuscrito\" (manuscript).[19] Samper wrote the Spanish-language lyrics phonetically to ease Bieber's pronunciation, which was \"perfectly\" achieved in two hours.[19] After a four-hour recording session, Gudwin sent Bieber's vocal tracks to Australian sound engineer Chris O'Ryan for vocal tuning.[17] Gudwin concluded the remix's production in Parrot Cay, Turks and Caicos Islands with the mixing of Luis Fonsi's English-language vocals, whose lyrics were written by American songwriter Marty James.[17] The entire process until the release date took six days.[17] In June 2017, English musician Ed Sheeran revealed that he wanted to record a remix version of the song but lost out to Justin Bieber.[20]\n\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\n\"Despacito\" is a reggaeton and Latin pop song composed in common time (**4**  \n**4** time) with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds and written in the key of B minor[21] with a tempo of 89 beats per minute and a common chord progression of Bm\u2014G\u2014D\u2014A.[22][23][24] The vocals span from F#3 to B4.[25] Its implicit lyrics are about having a sexual relationship in a smooth and romantic way, making heavy use of allegories.[26] However, Luis Fonsi expressed that some lines are free for interpretation.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Despacito\" (original version) sample\n\n\nPartial bridge and partial chorus of \"Despacito\"\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nMauricio Rengifo and Andr\u00e9s Torres produced \"Despacito\" using Pro Tools and the final mix consisted of 47 tracks.[28] The song begins with a Puerto Rican cuatro played by Christian Nieves, which is accompanied by an acoustic guitar played by Torres when Luis Fonsi starts performing.[28] Rengifo stated that the guitar \"was actually played, but then [they] chopped it and made it really digital.\"[28] The producers decided to record a cuatro because they wanted \"to feel very Puerto Rican and ethnic\" and that it \"gives the song a really unique character.\"[28] Nieves played salsa-influenced melodies during the chorus and the hook, which contains \"old school pop\" effects based on American producer Dr. Luke.[28] Percussion instruments guache and g\u00fcira were synchronized with a hi hat in order to highlight the track's cumbia influences.[28]\n\n\nThe song uses the side-chaining production technique in order to make the chorus \"more prominent,\" silencing the music as the kick drum hits.[29] It also makes heavy use of text painting when the music is slowed down as the word \"despacito\" (slowly) is performed at the beginning of every chorus.[29] Its percussion consists of guache, cowbell, timbales, g\u00fcira, and sequenced drum patterns.[28] The remix featuring Justin Bieber maintained the original rhythms and Luis Fonsi translated some lines to English, singing a verse in Spanglish, while Daddy Yankee's verses were kept from the original version.[18]\n\n\n\n## Release and reception[edit]\n\n\n\"Despacito\" was made available for digital download on January 13, 2017, by Universal Music Latin. Some music publications believed the single's success was influenced by a trend of combining Latin pop and urban music.[30] Fonsi referred to it as \"the new pop\" and Ender said that \"everyone is making this type of fusions.\"[3] Luis Fonsi also stated that two weeks after the release of the song and its music video he started receiving calls from \"people who normally don't call, people who only call when something different is going on.\" He got calls from Ricky Martin, Juan Luis Guerra, Marc Anthony and other artists telling him that the track was a \"home run.\"[31]\n\n\nSebastian Wernke-Schmiesing of *Dance-Charts* journal stated that \"a simple 4/4 time, Spanish guitar sounds, a crisp bass, and the excellent vocals by Luis Fonsi and [Daddy Yankee] were enough to get a hit single from the start.\"[32] Leila Cobo of *Billboard* praised its \"undeniable immediate catchiness\" and wrote that the song \"is a clever blend of romantic Latin pop with a reggaeton beat and subtly naughty lyrics.\"[33][34] Robert Joffred of Medium's culture blog That Good You Need highlighted the use of a steel-string guitar to play flamenco-style melodies instead of a nylon-string guitar, as well as the presence of \"swung rhythms\" when the word \"Despacito\" is sung at the beginning of the chorus[29] He referred to the text painting as \"pretty genius.\"[29] Raisa Bruner of *Time* magazine described the single as \"an infectious Latin melody amped up with reggaeton grooves and an irresistible dance tune.\"[35]\n\n\nSpanish record producer Nah\u00fam Garc\u00eda stated that \"the way the rhythm breaks before the chorus is genius\" and that this \"trick\" in particular is not common in pop music.[36] Joshua Barrie of *Irish Mirror* gave a negative opinion about the lyrics, referring to them as \"quite rude and a bit creepy\" and stating that \"some people might find them offensive.\"[37] On the other hand, an editor of Spanish music website Jenesaispop stated that \"the melody is very good, the lyrics are sexy without being vulgar and above all its structure is interesting.\"[38] Felix Contreras of National Public Radio praised the writing, arrangement and performances.[39]\n\n\nThe remix version featuring Justin Bieber was released on April 17, 2017, by Universal Music Latin, Republic Records, Def Jam Recordings, RBMG and Schoolboy Records.[40] Its official audio video garnered 20 million views on YouTube on its first 24 hours, making it the third-highest debut for a music-related video in 2017 as of September.[41] Caroline Soriano of *Ernstars* magazine stated that Bieber's voice \"sounds appealing with the song,\" whose remix version make it sound \"a little bit better.\"[42] Mike Senior of *Sound on Sound* gave a negative review of the remix's mixing by criticizing its polarity inversion regarding the original version and Justin Bieber's louder vocal track than Daddy Yankee's.[43] As to the original version, Senior referred to the first appearance of the \"Despacito\" hook line as a \"masterstroke\".[43]\n\n\nIn July 2017, officials from the Government of Malaysia reported that \"Despacito\" was being banned from airing on government-owned broadcast stations as a result of public complaints.[44] Government ministers said that the song was considered un-Islamic and that its lyrics were \"not suitable to be heard.\"[44]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of awards and nominations received by Daddy Yankee and List of awards and nominations received by Justin Bieber\n\n\"Despacito\" has received various awards and nominations following its commercial success.

listened-to artist worldwide on streaming service Spotify on July 9, 2017, being the first Latin artist to do so.[131] He later became the sixth most listened-to artist of 2017 on Spotify.[132] \"Despacito\" was cited by *Billboard*'s Leila Cobo as the song that renewed interest in the Latin music market from recording labels in the United States.[133] Xander Zellner of *Billboard* credited the influence of the single's success for the Latin music domination in the US mainstream market during 2017, as 11 primarily-Spanish-language songs debuted on the Hot 100.[77] American songwriter Desmond Child and Cuban musician Rudy P\u00e9rez expressed that \"not since Ricky Martin's 'Livin' La Vida Loca' has there been a song in any genre that has had the global impact of 'Despacito', changing the course of pop music forever.\"[50] In 2017, six out of the 10 most-viewed YouTube music videos were for songs performed in Spanish by Latin artists and *Billboard*'s Lars Brandle referred to it as \"the 'Despacito' effect.\"[134]\n\n\nBritish Official Charts Company recognized it as the song that \"helped Latin pop crossover to the mainstream once again.\"[135] Nielsen's Erin Crawford stated that the track had \"a halo effect on several other Latin hits ripe for crossover success\", most notably on J Balvin and Willy William's \"Mi Gente\"[80] *Rolling Stone* stated that the song \"hastened a massive historical turn in American music, demonstrating the mainstream viability of Spanish-language pop.\"[60] John Ochoa of *Rolling Stone* stated that \"the resulting so-called 'Despacito effect' has advanced a wave of subsequent Spanish-language hits and mainstream crossovers.\"[61]\n\n\nThe Recording Industry Association of America reported that Latin music revenues grew 37% in 2017, mostly due to music streaming.[136] Latin music's consumption in the United States increased 15% between the first half of 2016 and the first half of 2018.[137] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that revenue in Latin America grew 17.7% in 2017 and described \"Despacito\" as a \"game-changing hit.\"[121] In 2018, eight out of the 10 most-viewed YouTube music videos of the year were for songs performed in Spanish and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation referred to it as \"the 'Despacito' effect.\"[138][139]\n\n\nSony/ATV Music Publishing President Jorge Mej\u00eda stated that the song marked a \"before and after\" in the global consumption of Latin music.[140] Before its success, Sony \"had a big Latin single roughly every two years,\" a situation that reverted into an \"avalanche of Latin songs around the world.\"[140] Andrew Unterberger of *Billboard* stated that \"2017 was the year that Latin pop took over the United States\" due to the song and its quick impact on \"Mi Gente\", Camila Cabello's \"Havana\", and the chart performance of acts including Maluma, Ozuna and Bad Bunny, who achieved their biggest hits in the country.[141]\n\n\nIn July 2017, it was reported that tourist interest in Puerto Rico increased by 45% since the worldwide success of the song.[142][143] Tour operators cite the song's music video for increasing interest in locations such as Club La Factor\u00eda and La Perla district in Old San Juan, which were featured in the video.[144]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2006 Miss Universe Zuleyka Rivera also starred in the music video.\nThe music video for \"Despacito\" was directed by Puerto Rican director Carlos P\u00e9rez and produced by Joanna Egozcue and Roxy Qui\u00f1ones.[145] Filming took place in December 2016 in La Perla neighborhood and the bar La Factor\u00eda in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[145] Carlos P\u00e9rez had

EFE stated that the music video \"highlights some of the main cultural and folkloric symbols of Puerto Rico\" by showing its \"splendid beaches, the colorful landscape of La Perla, the rattle of the Puerto Rican cuatro and the barrels of the autochthonous genre of bomba, Zuleyka Rivera's hips movement and a pair of men enjoying a game of dominoes.\"[147]\n\n\n\n### Synopsis[edit]\n\n\nThe video

As Daddy Yankee is finishing his verse, Zuleyka Rivera enters La Factor\u00eda bar while the artists are performing and dancing alongside other people, and men are playing bomba drums.[147] Fonsi proceeds to dance with Rivera as the song ends. The outro consists of Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee singing the hook a cappella with the people at the bar.[147]\n\n\n\n### Release and reception[edit]\n\n\nThe official music video on YouTube was released on Fonsi's channel on January 12, 2017, and amassed one billion views in 97 days, becoming the second-fastest video on the site to reach the milestone.[149][150][151] It also became the fastest video on YouTube to surpass two billion views, with 154 days.[152] The clip became the first on YouTube to receive three, four, five, and six billion views on August 4, 2017; October 11, 2017; April 5, 2018; and February 24, 2019, respectively *(dates are based on UTC)*.[153][154][155][156] It has received over 8 billion views as of November 11, 2022, and was the most-viewed video on the site from August 4, 2017, until November 2, 2020, when Pinkfong's video for \"Baby Shark\" surpassed it, dethroning it to second place.[149][157][158] It is also the site's most-liked video, with over 50 million likes as of October 23, 2022.[159] On Vevo, the music video received 5.14 million views in its first 24 hours of release, which the website reported as being the most for a Spanish-language video's first day on its platform.[65]\n\n\nThe music video received a Latin Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards and a *Billboard* Music Award for Top Streaming Song (Video) at the 25th *Billboard* Music Awards, and was nominated for an American Music Award for Video of the Year at the 45th American Music Awards.[45][46][49]\n\n\n\n## Live performances[edit]\n\n\nLuis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee performed \"Despacito\" live together for the first time at the 2017 *Billboard* Latin Music Awards on April 27, 2017, and later on *The Voice* season 12 finals on May 23, 2017.[160][161] The only live performance by Justin Bieber and Luis Fonsi was at the Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in Puerto Rico on April 18, 2017, during the former's Purpose World Tour.[162] Bieber was not able to sing the song during live performances and was caught replacing portions of the lyrics with the word \"blah\" and nonsensical ramblings during one performance in a much publicized incident.[163] Fonsi has defended him for not knowing the lyrics, saying that he has to be given \"a little bit of a pass\" because Spanish is not Bieber's main language.[164]\n\n\nLuis Fonsi performed \"Despacito\" on American talk show *Conan* on June 12, 2017 -his first late-night television appearance in the United States- and on *The Ellen DeGeneres Show* on September 14, 2017.[165][166] He also performed the song with random lyrics alongside American television host Jimmy Fallon on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* on January 30, 2019.[167]\n\n\nBoth Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee included the song on their setlists for the 2017\u201318 Love + Dance World Tour and the 2017 Tamo En Vivo Europe Tour, respectively.[168][169][170] On November 16, 2017, Luis Fonsi sang \"Despacito\" featuring Puerto Rican singer Victor Manuelle, Colombian band Bomba Est\u00e9reo and American disc jockey Diplo at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards.[171] On January 28, 2018, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee performed the song at the 60th Grammy Awards on the Madison Square Garden, becoming the 12th and 13th Latin artists ever to perform at the Grammy Awards.[172][173] Fonsi also participated on United States President Joe Biden's inauguration by performing \"Despacito\" at the *Celebrating America* special on January 20, 2021.[174]\n\n\n\n## Other remixes and cover versions[edit]\n\n\nThe first two official remixes for \"Despacito\" were released on March 17, 2017: a solo pop version by Fonsi and a salsa version featuring vocals by Puerto Rican musician V\u00edctor Manuelle.[175] Two other remixes were released on May 5, 2017: an electronic dance version produced by American trio Major Lazer and Colombian DJ MOSKA and an urban version remixed by Colombian producer Sky.[176] A Portuguese-language version written by Erika Ender and performed by Luis Fonsi featuring Brazilian singer Israel Novaes was released on July 14, 2017.[177] A banda version by Luis Fonsi with Mexican group La Bandononona Clave Nueva De Max Peraza was released on September 1, 2017. A Spanish/Mandarin version by Luis Fonsi and Singaporean singer-songwriter JJ Lin was released on January 26, 2018.[178] A Norwegian version was released by Carina Dahl and Adrian J\u00f8rgensen in February 2018.[179] This version was certified Gold by IFPI Norway in 2019 and Platinum in 2021.[180]\n\n\nThe song has been covered by a wide range of artists around the world, including Korean singer J.Fla,[181] a classical crossover by Croatian-based duo 2Cellos,[182] a metal version by Norwegian musician Leo Moracchioli, a piano version by Hungarian pianist and world record-holder Peter Bence,[183] an acoustic version by American band Boyce Avenue[184] and a Broadway-style cover by American musical collective group Postmodern Jukebox.[185] These covers garnered between seven and 47 million views on YouTube except for J.Fla's video, which has 172 million views. Leo Moracchioli's version peaked at number 35 on the Hungarian Single Top 40 chart on August 10, 2017.[186]\n\n\n\n### Political uses[edit]\n\n\nThe song has been used, with altered lyrics, for political purposes. In Argentina, the melody was used by various politicians for their respective TV advertisements for the 2017 midterm elections, by scientists to protest against President Mauricio Macri and by feminists as an initiative to convoke people to a concentration about violence against women.[187][188][189] Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro used it to call for voting in the controversial Constituent Assembly election.[190] Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Erika Ender showed their displeasure with the unauthorized use of the song for political purposes in Venezuela, criticizing Maduro's government use of the song as propaganda.[191][192] On August 16, 2017, English television host James Corden remixed the song to comment on American President Donald Trump during his talk show *The Late Late Show with James Corden*.[193] On September 15, 2020, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden played a few bars from the song at a campaign event headlined by Luis Fonsi. In response, Trump tweeted an edited video showing Biden instead playing N.W.A's \"Fuck tha Police\".[194]\n\n\n\u0414\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0432\u0456\u0442\u0443 (\"Somewhere in the world\") was a Ukrainian version of the song, produced featuring children in Drohobych Raion, to encourage the return of Ukrainians working abroad.[195]\n\n\n\n## Credits and personnel[edit]\n\n\n|  |

The song was released as the lead single on January 27, 2016, through Westbury Road and Roc Nation. The song was written by the artists, PartyNextDoor, Monte Moir, Rupert \"Sevn\" Thomas, Allen Ritter, and producer Matthew \"Boi-1da\" Samuels, with additional production from Kuk Harrell and Noah \"40\" Shebib.[1] The dancehall, reggae-pop, and R&B song, contains an interpolation of \"If You Were Here Tonight\" (1985) performed by Alexander O'Neal. Lyrically, the song incorporates themes of working for money, as well as discussing fragile relationships. The song is written in Jamaican Patois and Bajan Creole.[2][3] Three of its writer-producers: Rupert \"Sevn\" Thomas, Matthew \"Boi-1da\" Samuels, and Jahron \"PartyNextDoor\" Brathwaite, are Jamaican Canadians.[4][5]\n\n\nCritical response to \"Work\" was mixed upon release; critics praised its composition and Rihanna's decision to return to her earlier themes of dancehall music, while others were more skeptical of the song's potential as a comeback for the singer. Critical opinion improved over time; the song was included on several year-end lists and nominated for two awards at the 59th Grammy Awards: Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. The song reached number one on the United States' *Billboard* Hot 100 chart, becoming Rihanna's fourteenth number-one single and making her the act with the fourth-most number-one songs on the chart (after The Beatles, Mariah Carey and Elvis Presley). The song remained at the top for nine weeks. The song also peaked at number one in nine additional countries and is certified Platinum or higher in thirteen countries, including 9\u00d7 Platinum in the US, 3\u00d7 Platinum in the UK and Diamond in France. It has also since sold 32.5 million units worldwide, making it one of the best-selling digital singles of all-time.[6]\n\n\nThe song was accompanied by two music videos, which both premiered on February 22, 2016. The first of the two versions was directed by Rihanna's previous collaborator Director X, while the second was directed by Tim Erem. The song was further promoted with live performance's at the 2016 Brit Awards which featured guest appearances from Drake and SZA, the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards, as well as being performed on the Anti World Tour. \"Work\" became the first dancehall song to top the *Billboard* Hot 100 since Rihanna's own \"Rude Boy\" (2010) and was succeeded three weeks later by another dancehall song, Drake's \"One Dance\".\n\n\n\n\n## Background and release[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the release of Rihanna's seventh studio album, *Unapologetic*, and its accompanying tour, Rihanna took a step back from music.[7]\nRihanna aimed to take a hiatus from recording music stating; \"I wanted to have a year to just do whatever I want artistically, creatively,\" Rihanna went on to state that this hiatus lasted a week and she had returned to the recording studio. Following the release of three singles in 2015\u2014\"FourFiveSeconds\" (with Kanye West and Paul McCartney), \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" and \"American Oxygen\"\u2014*Billboard* announced that Rihanna was set to premiere a new single on January 27, 2016, at 8 am EST.[8] That same day, \"Work\" premiered on several radio stations worldwide including the BBC Radio 1 in the United Kingdom. Subsequently, it was made available for digital download in most countries worldwide via the iTunes Store and was added for streaming on Apple Music, Spotify, and Tidal.[9]\n\n\n\n## Writing and recording[edit]\n\n\n\"Work\" was written by PartyNextDoor, Drake, Rihanna, Monte Moir, Rupert \"Sevn\" Thomas, Allen Ritter and Matthew Samuels, and was produced by Boi-1da, Sevn Thomas, Ritter, Kuk Harrell and Noah \"40\" Shebib.[10] In the summer of 2015, Thomas, Ritter, Boi-1da, and Martin Mason, among others, stayed at Drake's house in Los Angeles for a mid-week period. Thomas described the time spent at the home as a \"beat factory, everyone was sitting there working and collaborating with each other.\"[11]\n\n\nThomas created a beat which was dancehall-influenced; he later played it for Boi-1da to which he positively responded, \"We're both Jamaican-Canadian. It was just something in our DNA, so it woke him up, and we started remembering all these old dancehall songs from the '90s.\" Boi-1da came with up idea for sampling an \"old school dancehall rhythm\" and after that the chords were made with Ritter and past it, \"everything went organically\". The most recognizable sampling found in the \"Work\" riddim is from the 1998 riddim \"Sail Away\" which was produced by Richie Stephens and Mikey 2000,[11] interpolating Alexander O'Neal's \"If You Were Here Tonight\".[12]\n\n\nWhen the song's music was finished, Boi-1da sent it to PartyNextDoor who wrote the lyrics, \"he's an incredible writer, and he's Jamaican as well. I think so that's how he's able to come up with those vibes and feels,\" noted Thomas. PartyNextDoor originally wrote the record as a breakup song,[13] after Drake heard the song he loved it and decided to write and record a verse on it. The original reference track contained Braithwaite's vocals and a tweaked verse from Drake. It leaked as a snippet in February 2016,[14] the full version was released online in April 2016.[15] At first the intent was to keep the song as a collaboration between the two or give to Alicia Keys.[16] Shortly after Braithwaite stayed at Rihanna's home in Malibu, where he played her the song,[11] afterwards \"it was all that she could sing around the house\" and it was her \"family's favourite song\".[16]\n\n\nRihanna's vocals were recorded by Marcos Tovar and Kuk Harrell at the Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles; the latter also served as a vocal producer. Drake's vocals were recorded by Noel Cadastre and Noah \"40\" Shebib at the Sandra Gale Studios in California and the SOTA Studios in Toronto. The vocal recording was assisted by Thomas Warren, while additional vocals were provided by PartyNextDoor. Manny Marroquin mixed \"Work\" at the Larrabee Studios, while Noel \"Gadget\" Campbell and Shebib did the mixing at the Studio 360 and SOTA Studios in Toronto. The mastering was done by Chris Gehringer at the Sterling Sound in New York City.[17] \"Work\" marked the third collaboration between Rihanna and Drake, following \"What's My Name?\" in 2010 and \"Take Care\" in 2012.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Composition and lyrical interpretation[edit]\n\n\n\"Work\" is a dancehall,[19] reggae-pop[20] and R&B[21] song, with a length of three minutes and thirty-nine seconds.[22][23] Hugh McIntyre of *Forbes* described the song as \"quite\" urban and mixes hip hop influences with \"island vibes\".[24] Zach Frydenlund of *Complex* wrote that the song \"is slower and very rhythmic with Rihanna showing off her vocal skills over the crafty production.\"[25] The song is written in the key of C# Dorian (same key signature as G\u266f minor) in common time with a tempo of 92 beats per minute. The vocals in the song span from F\u266f3 to E\u266d5.[26] Alexa Camp of *Slant Magazine* called it \"an understated midtempo jam in the vein of Janet Jackson's recent 'No Sleeep', with a percolating beat, sinuous synth lines, and vocal samples stretched and pulled in a way that recalls Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis's masterful production work on Janet's 1997 album *The Velvet Rope*.\"[27] *The Guardian*'s Harriet Gibsone wrote: \"The glossy, modernist 'Work' skewers elements of dub and dancehall: her voice is at times Auto-Tuned, and a distant sample of what sounds a little like Grace Jones's \"My Jamaican Guy\" haunts its empty spaces.\"[28]\n\n\n*Rolling Stone*'s Daniel Kreps wrote the song contains \"a tropical house vibe\".[29] In contrary, Taj Ran from *Billboard* wrote the song \"isn't part of a new genre that many in the mainstream media are calling 'tropical house.' *Anti*'s lead single is undeniably drenched in dancehall, a genre with deep roots in Jamaica's club scene that spun off from reggae in the 1970s.\"[30] According to *The Atlantic*'s Spencer Kornhaber, the single has \"strangely unfinished quality\" that features its verses, choruses and bridge fade into themselves, \"forgoing soft-to-loud explosions or exciting rhythmic changes\".[31] He also noted that, Boi-1da also tries to create \"escalation\" in the song by adding additional drums for the second chorus, flutes, autotuned harmonies and back-off piano.[31] *The New York Times*' Jon Caramanica noted Rihanna at times \"barely even relies on words, truncating her syllables past patois to something far less exact.\"[32] Lyrically, \"Work\" is \"about working for a paycheck no matter what else is going on in your life.\"[31] Additionally, it focuses on \"a fragile relationship\" that can be seen in the lines, \"If I get another chance to, I would never, oh never, neglect you,\" which Rihanna sings.[20]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n\"Work\" has received mixed reviews from critics. Editor Joe Lynch wrote that the track finds Rihanna \"reteaming with frequent collaborator/ex Drake, but that's the only predictable thing about this song\u2014while it's hardly a 180-degree turn for Rih, its minimal production subverts expectations of what you'd expect a major pop star to release when they're gearing up to drop their long-delayed new album.\"[33] Alexa Camp of *Slant Magazine* wrote: \"the new track has the potential to at least partly justify the gold crown on the album's cover.\"[27] BET's Kathy Iandoli called the song \"comfortable, but still good.\"[34] *Spin*'s Brennan Carley thought Rihanna made the \"lackadaisical song gel.\"[35] Other critics were more skeptical. Hugh McIntyre of *Forbes* wrote \"It's a well-produced song, but is it the pop hit that she needed?\"[24] Idolator's Robbie Daw's review was mixed, writing \"Musically, the track is a charming, if also somewhat sparse, affair that feels like it blew in on a tropical, warm June wind and nestled up beside our ears.\"[36]\n\n\nRobin Reiff of *The A.V. Club* wrote: \"the sheer repetition of the hook creates a built-in expiration date for when this song transitions from catchy to mildly annoying.\"[37]\nTaj Rani of *Billboard* stated \"Work\" has brought the genre of dancehall to the forefront of American music (again), as it became the first dancehall song to top the *Billboard* Hot 100 since Sean Paul's \"Temperature\" in 2006. She opined that the song is a prime example of \"an unapologetic black woman proudly showing her heritage at a time when our politics are dominated by #BlackLivesMatter and Donald Trump's racist, xenophobic and misogynistic tirades.\" Rani continued to state that although mainstream critics are uncomfortable with Rihanna's use of patois (describing it as \"gibberish\"), she is able to display West Indian culture front and center without appropriation from mainstream culture.[38]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n*Rolling Stone* named \"Work\" one of the 30 best songs of the first half of 2016: \"What would even you call a minimalist banger? One of America's most reliable singles artists created an arch, moody album instead of a handful of chart-ready pop confections, but we still couldn't resist this barely-there tune with a beat like a dancehall wisp and lyrics like a freestyle.\"[39]\nThe Guardian named it \"Best track of 2016\", writing: \"Work was off-kilter, lacked a big chorus and weaved in a dubious 80s ballad. It also clicked perfectly, a song that captured two era-defining artists and one all the more infectious for its rule-defying restraint.\"[40]\nThe British magazine *NME* named \"Work\" the best song of 2016 in their year-end critics' poll.[41] *NPR* and *Consequence of Sound* both place the song at number fifteen on their year end lists.[42][43] For *Pitchfork* it was the seventh best song of the year.[44] *Billboard* ranked \"Work\" at number 25 on their \"100 Best Pop Songs of 2016\" list: \"Its hypnotic chorus burrowing its way into the year's subconscious.\"[45] In the annual *Village Voice*'s Pazz & Jop mass critics poll of the year's best in music in 2016, \"Work\" was tied at number 9, with David Bowie's \"Blackstar\".[46]\n\"Work\" has been nominated for the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and the Record of the Year at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.[47] \"Work\" won the awards for \"R&B Song of the Year\" and \"Best Collaboration\" at the 2017 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[48]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\n\"Work\" debuted at number nine on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart issue dated February 13, 2016. It became the 27th top-ten hit for Rihanna and 15th for Drake. With this feat, Rihanna tied Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson and Elton John as the artists with the fifth-most top-ten songs on the chart.[49] The singer scored 27 top-ten singles on the Hot 100 in a span of 10 years and eight months between her first single, \"Pon de Replay\" and \"Work\", and became the fastest solo artist to reach the plateau.[50] It also became Rihanna's 50th song to chart on the Hot 100.[*citation needed*] \"Work\" debuted at number one on the US *Billboard* Digital Songs chart with over 126,000 downloads sold in only just over a day of tracking. Additionally, \"Work\" launched at number 27 on the US *Billboard* Radio Songs chart with 44 million audience impressions, becoming the highest debut of her career. \n\n\nThe following week, \"Work\" sold an additional 156,000 copies and moved up to number seven on the Hot 100 chart.[51] In its third week, \"Work\" jumped 7\u20134 on the Hot 100 chart, earning Rihanna rihanna her milestone 20th top-five hit, tying her with Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder as the artists with the fifth-most top-five songs on the chart[52] In its fourth week, \"Work\" reached the summit of the Hot 100 chart and became Rihanna's fourteenth number-one song in the United States. Subsequently, she became the artist with the fourth-most number-one songs on the chart following The Beatles with 20, Mariah Carey with 19 and Elvis Presley with 18 chart toppers. She broke a tie with Michael Jackson, who had reached 13 chart-toppers on the *Billboard* Hot 100 in his lifetime. Additionally, \"Work\" became Drake's second number-one single on the chart, the previous being the pair's 2010 collaboration, \"What's My Name?\". For the same issue, it rose to number 10 on the Radio Songs chart and became her 24th top-ten single, surpassing Mariah Carey's lead of 23 top-tens on that chart. The song remained at number-one on the Hot 100 for nine consecutive weeks and was unseated by Desiigner's \"Panda\".[53]\n\n\nThe song was most successful on the *Billboard* Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs where it debuted atop the chart, becoming Rihanna's fifth chart-topper and Drake's fourteenth.[49] As of January 2021, \"Work\" has accumulated over 1.4\u00a0billion streams and 1,906,000 downloads in the United States.[54]\n\n\nIn France, \"Work\" peaked at number one on the chart for two weeks, becoming Rihanna's sixth number-one in the country, the second-highest amount of all time. The single also broke the record for the most streams in a single week, with 2.056 million streams.[55]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nDirector X (left) directed the first of the song's two accompanying videos which was filmed in The Real Jerk restaurant (right)\n\nTwo music videos were released for the single; the first was directed by Director X who had previously worked with Rihanna on her debut video \"Pon de Replay\"[56] while the second was directed by Tim Erem.[57] Harv Glazer and Melissa Larsen served as a producer of the visual, while Daniel Bouquet and Alexi Zabes were the director of photography. Laura McMillan and Nick Rondeau were the editors of the video, while Nick Cortes served as the production coordinator. Missy Galanida, Isaac Rice and Taj Critchlow, served as the videos executive producers while Dave Hussey of Company 3 was the colorist.[58]\n\n\nRihanna later announced its premiere date to be February 22, 2016 via her Twitter account, while also releasing a videoclip via YouTube.[59]\nFilming of the first accompanying music video took place at the Real Jerk restaurant in Toronto on February 5.[60]\nDirector X stated that when filming the video they wanted to make it look like they were in a West Indian neighborhood, in a West Indian restaurant.[61]\nThe second video for the single directed by Tim Erem was discussed between the director, Rihanna and Drake in the studio at 4 a.m., where they were attempting to come up with ideas to add a tropical vibe to their already existing footage. After thirty minutes they came up with the idea of shooting a video in a whole pink room.[62]\n\n\nThe first video opens with a shot of \"The Real Jerk\" carpark, in which Rihanna and Drake enter separately.

The song was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards[5] being listed as one of the best songs of the year by *Uproxx[6]* and 3voor12.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2016, the Chainsmokers shared three short clips of an upcoming song featuring vocals from Chris Martin.[8] On February 22, 2017, Spotify prematurely posted a banner ad at the top of the site's home page with a Listen Now button.[9]\n\n\nOn the same date, Coldplay premiered \"Something Just Like This\" with the Chainsmokers on stage at the Brit Awards at The O2 Arena in London, England.[10] They then performed the song at the 2017 iHeartRadio Music Awards at The Forum in Inglewood, California on March 5, 2017[11] and on their A Head Full of Dreams Tour since the Singapore show on March 31, 2017.[12] It was performed again at the *One Love Manchester* benefit concert for the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing on June 4, 2017.[13]\n\n\n\n## Lyric video[edit]\n\n\nA lyric video was also released on February 22, 2017 on the Chainsmokers' Vevo channel. It has received over 2.1 billion views and is one of the 70 most viewed videos on YouTube.[14][15] It was directed by James Zwadlo.\n\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\nThe song is written in the key of D major and has a tempo of 103.156 beats per minute in common time. It follows a chord progression of G(add9)\u2013Asus\u2013Bm\u2013Asus, and the vocals span two octaves, from G2 to G4.[16]\n\n\n\n## Chart performance[edit]\n\n\n\"Something Just Like This\" debuted at number 56 on the *Billboard* Hot 100 and soared to number five on its second week, becoming the Chainsmokers' third top five after \"Don't Let Me Down\" and \"Closer\". Meanwhile, it was Coldplay's second top five hit after \"Viva la Vida\", which peaked at number three on the *Billboard* Hot 100 ever since. The song was also the sixth best-selling track of 2017 in the United States with 1,348,000 copies sold.[17] In the United Kingdom, \"Something Just Like This\" debuted at number 30 on 24 February 2017, reaching its number two peak position the following week behind Ed Sheeran's \"Shape of You\". It spent nine consecutive weeks in the top 10 and became the ninth biggest song of the year in the country.[18] The song also set a new record for most weeks atop *Billboard*'s Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart (79).[19]\n\n\n\n## Track listing[edit]\n\n\nDigital download[20]| No. | Title | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | \"Something Just like This\" | 4:07 |\n\nDigital download \u2013

The criterion for inclusion is to sell at least ten million copies worldwide. The singles listed here were cited by reliable sources from various media, such as digital journalism, newspapers, magazines, and books.\n\n\nAccording to *Guinness World Records*, Irving Berlin's \"White Christmas\" (1942) as performed by Bing Crosby is the best-selling single worldwide, with estimated sales of over 50 million copies.[1] The song, recognized as \"the best-selling single of all time\", was released before the pop/rock singles-chart era and \"was listed as the world's best-selling single in the first-ever *Guinness Book of Records* (published in 1955) and\u2014remarkably\u2014still retains the title more than 50 years later\". *Guinness World Records* also states that double A-side charity single \"Candle in the Wind 1997\"/\"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\" (1997) by Elton John (rewritten as a tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales, rather than Marilyn Monroe in the original 1973 version), is \"the biggest-selling single since UK and US singles charts began in the 1950s, having accumulated worldwide sales of 33 million copies\". This makes it the second-best-selling physical single of all time.[1]\n\n\nTwo best-selling singles lists are displayed here relating first to physical singles (mainly CD and vinyl singles) and second to digital singles (digitally downloaded tracks which first became available to purchase in the early 2000s).\n\n\n\n\n## Best-selling physical singles[edit]\n\n\n### 15\u00a0million physical copies

You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)1942 10-inch 78 rpm release of the single \"White Christmas\" by Bing Crosby\n![](image)1997 7-inch 45 rpm release of \"Candle in the Wind 1997\"/\"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\", double A-side single by Elton John\nThis is a compendium of the best-selling music singles. The criterion for inclusion is to sell at least ten million copies worldwide. The singles listed here were cited by reliable sources from various media, such as digital journalism, newspapers, magazines, and books.\n\n\nAccording to *Guinness World Records*, Irving Berlin's \"White Christmas\" (1942) as performed by Bing Crosby is the best-selling single worldwide, with estimated sales of over 50 million copies.[1] The song, recognized as \"the best-selling single of all time\", was released before the pop/rock singles-chart era and \"was listed as the world's best-selling single in the first-ever *Guinness Book of Records* (published in 1955) and\u2014remarkably\u2014still retains the title more than 50 years later\". *Guinness World Records* also states that double A-side charity single \"Candle in the Wind 1997\"/\"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\" (1997) by Elton John (rewritten as a tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales, rather than Marilyn Monroe in the original 1973 version), is \"the biggest-selling single since UK and US singles charts began in the 1950s, having accumulated worldwide sales of 33 million copies\". This makes it the second-best-selling physical single of all time.[1]\n\n\nTwo best-selling singles lists are displayed here relating first to physical singles (mainly CD and vinyl singles) and second to digital singles (digitally downloaded tracks which first became available to purchase in the early 2000s).\n\n\n\n\n## Best-selling physical singles[edit]\n\n\n### 15\u00a0million physical copies

It was released on 6 January 2017 as one of the double lead singles from his third studio album *\u00f7* (2017), along with \"Castle on the Hill\". The dancehall and R&B-infused pop song was written by Sheeran, Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid. Due to its interpolation of \"No Scrubs\" by TLC, Kandi Burruss, Tameka \"Tiny\" Cottle, and Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs are also credited as writers. The song was produced by Sheeran and Mac.\n\n\n\"Shape of You\" peaked at number one on the singles charts of 34 countries, including the US *Billboard* Hot 100 (later becoming the best performing song of 2017), as well as the UK, Australian and Canadian singles charts. It stayed at number one for a record-tying 16 consecutive weeks on the Canadian Hot 100, as well as 14 nonconsecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart, and 12 non-consecutive weeks on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\nOn 10 December 2018, the song became the first song to hit 2\u00a0billion streams on Spotify and is currently the 2nd most streamed song on the platform with 3.6 billion streams, behind \"Blinding Lights\" by the Weeknd. It was also the most-streamed song of the decade on Spotify with 2.4\u00a0billion streams by December 2019, and the most streamed song on Apple Music with 930 million streams, as of May 2023. It was the best-selling song of 2017 and the decade in the UK. \"Shape of You\" was the best-selling song of 2017 and the second best-selling digital song worldwide, with combined sales and track-equivalent streams of 26.6\u00a0million units according to IFPI.[2]\n\n\nIn 2018, it sold an additional 14.9\u00a0million copies, combining a total of 41.5\u00a0million copies worldwide with the previous total sales figure, making it one of the best selling digital singles of all time. Additionally, it made a second appearance in the *Billboard* year-end chart in 2018, at No. 71.[3] In 2019, it was named the number-one song on the *Billboard* Mainstream Top 40 chart of the 2010s decade.[4] \"Shape of You\" was nominated for British Single of the Year and British Video of the Year at the 2018 Brit Awards.[5] The song won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards.[6] In 2021, *Billboard* ranked \"Shape of You\" as the tenth most successful song of all-time.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nThe song was the last song written for Sheeran's third album *\u00f7*.[8] As he had recently written all the songs he wanted for the album, the song was therefore not intended to be included in the album. It was conceived as a duet between Rihanna and Rudimental, but the head of the record label convinced him to keep the song for himself.[9] He said:\n\n\n\n\n>  \"['Shape of You'] is actually a really random one because I went in to write songs for other people with a guy called Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid, and we were writing this song and I was like 'this would really work for Rihanna,'\" he explained. \"And then I started singing lyrics like 'putting Van the Man on the jukebox' and I was like 'well she's not really going to sing that, is she?' And then we sort of decided halfway through that we were just going to make it for me.\"[10]\n> \n> \n\n\nAccording to Sheeran, Steve Mac started the songwriting session by playing the opening notes of the song on the keyboard. Sheeran then joined in, adding percussion by tapping on the guitar, layering it onto the track. On the writing of the song, he said that he tried to keep the music \"more stripped\" instead of something more elaborate: \"I'm an acoustic artist, first and foremost. And when I play live, I can't replicate these things, I haven't got all the other musicians.\" Sheeran said he wanted an R&B feel to the song, therefore he adjusted the original tune, adding an interpolation of \"No Scrubs\" onto part of the melody. He also revealed that the original lyrics did not end with the words \"the shape of you\" in the chorus, but during the writing of the song, McDaid thought that the lyrics \"I'm in love with your body\" sounded objectifying, and the lyrics was therefore adjusted.[11][9] In a March 2023 interview with *Rolling Stone*, Sheeran revealed that he had attempted to get a Jay-Z guest verse; however, the American rapper declined, stating that he \"doesn't think the song needs a rap verse\".[12]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\nOn 6 January 2017, when hosting *The Radio 1 Breakfast Show*, Sheeran revealed that \"Shape of You\" was written with Rihanna in mind.[13][14] On 4 January 2017, Sheeran uploaded a six-second teaser video of a blue background to social media, with lyrics \"the club isn't the best place to find a lover\", which is the first line of \"Shape of You\". To further tease the release, Sheeran and his label used a sponsored Snapchat lens filter with 30 seconds of the song to increase buzz among the general public.[15]\n\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\n\"Shape of You\" has been characterised as pop,[16] dancehall,[17][18] and tropical house,[19] with \"strummy acoustics.\"[20] \"Shape of You\" is written in the key of C\u266f minor with a tempo of 96 beats per minute. The song is composed in common time (**4**  \n**4** time), and follows a basic chord progression of C\u266fm\u2013F\u266fm\u2013A\u2013B (i\u2013iv\u2013VI\u2013VII), and Sheeran's vocals span from G\u266f3 to G\u266f5.[21] It has a tresillo rhythm.[22]\n\n\nIn the song, Sheeran sings over a marimba-fueled percussive sway about a budding romance: \"The club isn't the best place to find a lover, so the bar is where I go/ Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow\", he sings. \"Come over and start up a conversation with just me/ And trust me I'll give it a chance.\"[23][24] According to *NT News*, the song \"tells the story of loved (or lusted) up Sheeran meeting a girl in a bar where he and his mates are doing shots.\"[25]\n\n\nThe song's lyrical rhythm drew some comparisons to the 1999 TLC hit \"No Scrubs\", particularly in the pre-chorus line, \"Boy, let's not talk too much/ Grab on my waist and put that body on me\". Kandi Burruss had told Bravo\u2019s Andy Cohen that the negotiations had started before the song's release for its interpolation but weren't finalized until afterwards. As a result, the composers of \"No Scrubs\", Kandi Burruss, Tameka \"Tiny\" Cottle, and Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs, received co-writing credits on \"Shape of You\".[26]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nJon Caramanica from *The New York Times* said, \"'Shape of You' is trickier, a nimble and effective song that takes the aggressive thinning of 'Caribbean music'.\"[27] *Billboard*'s Taylor Weatherby wrote about the song saying, \"'Shape of You' doesn't quite sound like your typical Sheeran tune. But that almost serves as an indication of what the 'Thinking Out Loud' singer has been up to during his hiatus: creating music that still feels like Sheeran, just with a new twist.\"[28] Jeremy Gordon of *Spin* gave the song a positive review, stating that the song \"is a plausible attempt at convincing us he has had sex ... a lot of it. It kind of slaps, though you can't really picture Sheeran ever saying 'put that body on me' to a real human woman.\"[29] *Entertainment Weekly* gave the song a B+ rating,[30] and *Rolling Stone* ranked the song at number 13 on its \"50 best songs of 2017\" list.[31] *USA Today* ranked it at number 36 of 2017 singles.[32]\n\n\n*Uproxx* ranked the song at number 3 on its \"The Worst Songs Of 2017\" list: \"The contrarian in me is always tempted to defend Ed Sheeran, because it's way too easy to take shots at this guy... Then I hear the part in 'Shape Of You' where he says, 'And last night you were in my room / And now my bedsheets smell like you.' And now I want to push him into a locker.\"[33] *Spin* and *Esquire* listed it as one of the worst songs of 2017.[34][35] In 2022, *Far Out* placed it on its \"The 10 worst songs to have spent 10 weeks at Number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100\" list.[36]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\n\"Shape of You\" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 13 January 2017, selling 227,000 combined units in its first week and becoming Sheeran's third UK number one. Sheeran also debuted at number two with the song \"Castle on the Hill\", making him the first artist in UK chart history to debut in the top two positions simultaneously.[37] It spent 13 consecutive weeks at number one,[38] and a further week at the top after a week's interruption by Harry Styles' \"Sign of the Times\".[39] In July 2017, the song reached 184 million in streams, making it the most-streamed song in the UK of all time.[40] It was the nation's highest selling and most streamed track of 2017 with 787,000 copies sold and 248\u00a0million streams throughout the year, to produce a combined sales of 3.2\u00a0million.[41] In September 2020, the track was certified eight-times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).[42] \"Shape of You\" is Sheeran's best-selling single in the UK with total sales of 5.09 million units as of July 2021, according to the Official Charts Company.[43]\n\n\nThe song debuted at number one on the *Billboard* Hot 100, selling 240,000 downloads and gaining 20 million streams in its debut week in the US, becoming Sheeran's first number one song in the country.[44] Sheeran also became the first artist to debut two songs in the top 10 the same week in the history of the Hot 100, with \"Castle on the Hill\" also debuting at number six.[44] \"Shape of You\" topped the Hot 100 for 12 non-consecutive weeks.[45] In its fourth week at number one, the song also topped the Mainstream Top 40, becoming Sheeran's second number-one single on the chart (after 2015's \"Thinking Out Loud\"). On 6 May 2017, it fell to number two on the Hot 100, being displaced by Kendrick Lamar's \"Humble\".[46] On the issue date, 2 September 2017, \"Shape of You\" spent its 32nd week in the top ten of Hot 100, tying the record for the most weeks on that chart with LeAnn Rimes' \"How Do I Live\" and the Chainsmokers' \"Closer\" featuring Halsey.[47] The following week, \"Shape of You\" spent its 33rd consecutive week in the top 10, breaking the 20-year-old record. This record would be tied twice and eventually broken in 2020 by Post Malone's \"Circles.\"[48] On *Billboard*'s Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart, \"Shape of You\" became Sheeran's first number one on a Dance/EDM chart (his third top ten and sixth overall at Dance/Mix Show Airplay) in the United States.[49] Afterwards, the song topped Dance Club Songs in its 18 March 2017 issue, his first as a solo artist and his second entry on this chart, when he was a featured artist on Rudimental's \"Lay It All on Me\", which peaked at No. 38 in 2016.[50][51] By August 2017, \"Shape of You\" was the best selling song of 2017 in the US with 2.3\u00a0million copies sold, the only one to sell over two million. It is also the most streamed song with 799.7\u00a0million combined audio and video streams.[47] The song became the number one song of the year on *Billboard* Hot 100 in 2017,[52] and the second best-selling song in the US after \"Despacito\" with over 2.5\u00a0million copies sold.[53]\n\n\nIt debuted at number one in France,[54] and was later certified diamond there.[55] According to Pure Charts, in the first half of the year 2017, the song reached 631,000 units (105,000 sales and 526,000 units from streams) and as of September 2017, it exceeds 812,109 units (707,109 from streams).[56] It was the best-selling song (including streaming) in France this year.[57] In Australia, the song stayed at No. 1 for 15 weeks, breaking a record set 22 years ago by Coolio's \"Gangsta's Paradise\".[58] In doing this, it also broke ABBA's record of fourteen weeks at number one, which was set on the previous Australian charts before the ARIA charts became Australia's official charts.[59] \"Shape of You\" was also Australia's highest selling song of 2017 with 630,000 copies sold by the end of the year.[60] The song is the first ever number one single of the now-defunct Philippine Hot 100 upon the chart's inception on 12 June 2017.[61] It stayed at the peak position for 4 consecutive weeks before it was dethroned by \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWorldwide, the song reached one billion streams on Spotify in June 2017.[62][63] It became the most streamed song on Spotify in September 2017, reaching 1,318,420,396 streams overtaking Drake's \"One Dance\".[64] It became the first song to reach 2 billions in streams on Spotify in 2018,[65] and it was the most-streamed song of the decade on Spotify, with 2.4\u00a0billion streams in the 2010s.[66] On 22 December 2021, \"Shape of You\" became Spotify's first song to hit 3\u00a0billion streams.[67] In May 2023, Apple Music announced that \"Shape of You\" was the most-streamed song on the platform, with over 930 million streams.[68][69]\n\n\nIn August 2018, *Billboard* published a new edition of the \"Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Singles\" chart, its list of the 100 best-performing songs in the history of the Hot 100. \"Shape of You\" was ranked at number nine, the third-highest position of any song released in the 2010s (behind only \"Uptown Funk\" by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars and \"Party Rock Anthem\" by LMFAO featuring Lauren Bennett and GoonRock).[70]\n\n\nOn November 23, 2021, *Billboard* published an updated edition of the \"Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Singles\" chart from 2018 where \"Shape of You\" is currently ranked the #10 Greatest Hot 100 Hit of All Time following the induction of the Weeknd's 2019 single \"Blinding Lights\" which currently holds the #1 position.[71]\n\n\n\n## Copyright trial[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Sheeran was taken to court by musicians Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue who allege \"Shape of You\" infringes \"particular lines and phrases\" of their 2015 composition \"Oh Why\".[72][73] Sheeran and his co-writers, Steven McCutcheon and John McDaid, have been barred by music licensing body PRS for Music from collecting an estimated \u00a320m in royalties from the performances or broadcasts of \"Shape of You\". Legal proceedings began in May 2018, with Sheeran and his co-writers asking the high court to declare they had not infringed Chokri and O'Donoghue's copyright. Two months later, Chokri and O'Donoghue issued their own claim for \"copyright infringement, damages and an account of profits in relation to the alleged infringement\".[74]\n\n\nOn 6 April 2022, the judge ruled that Sheeran had \"neither deliberately nor subconsciously copied\" Chokri's song. While there were \"similarities between the one-bar phrase\", the judge said that \"differences between the relevant parts\" of the songs were \"compelling evidence that the 'Oh I' phrase\" in Sheeran's song \"originated from sources other than Oh Why\".[75] After the win, Sheeran said: \"I feel like claims like this are way too common now and have become a culture where a claim is made with the idea that a settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there's no basis for the claim. It's really damaging to the songwriting industry. There's only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music. Coincidence is bound to happen if 60,000 songs are being released every day on Spotify. That's 22 million songs a year, and there's only 12 notes that are available.\"[76]\n\n\n\n## Lyric video[edit]\n\n\nOn 5 January 2017, to accompany the song's release, a lyric video for \"Shape of You\" was released on Sheeran's YouTube channel with \"Castle on the Hill\".[77] As of April 2022, the official lyric video has had 914 million views on YouTube.[78]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\n### Release[edit]\n\n\nOn 30 January 2017, the official music video of the song, paying homage to the Rocky films, starring US dancer and model Jennie Pegouskie and retired professional sumo wrestler Yamamotoyama Ry\u016bta (credited as \"Yama\"), was released on Sheeran's channel.[79][80] It was shot in Seattle, and was directed by Jason Koenig, who also directed Sheeran's fourth single \"Perfect\" from *\u00f7*.[81]\n\n\n\n### Synopsis[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

As the song begins, we see Sheeran shadowboxing while Pegouskie is already at the gym ready for the workout. She hangs herself at the punching bag doing sit-up and stretches herself. A little while later, Pegouskie shadowboxes and punches a punching bag when Sheeran lately arrives at the training carrying a bag with him. After Sheeran places his bag at the closet, he proceeds to train himself for his upcoming match trained by a personal trainer along with Pegouskie who still warms herself up. Later, Sheeran and Pegouskie head out of the gym towards a restaurant while bonding each other. Upon arriving, the couple eat and share foods like canoodling over a fried chicken as they have an intimate conversation with each other, although their dialogue is entirely mute. Afterwards, Sheeran and his girlfriend ride a taxi and make out at the back seat while the taxi driver does not notice this as he is focusing on driving. Back at the gym, Sheeran and Pegouskie physically trained hard doing various training exercises. While training, the couple embraced each other and teach one other, eventually falling in love with each other in the process. Later, Pegouskie leaves a picture and a box to Sheeran in a closet and seemingly abandons him. The scene cuts back to Sheeran who discovers a picture and a black box both seen earlier with the latter containing a blue mouthguard featuring a **\"\u00f7\"** symbol at the front. Realizing that his girlfriend had left him (unbeknownst to him, she already is at a passenger ship), He starts to search for her to no avail. In response to her disappointing departure, Sheeran lets out his frustration and proceeds to an intense workout that includes tire-flipping, shadowboxing, sit-up, running and push-up. Later, Sheeran participates a match he has anticipated throughout the clip but he unexpectedly encounters a Rikishi or a sumo wrestler (Yamamotoyama Ry\u016bta), much to his shock. During the match, Sheeran is seen almost always avoiding Yama who constantly chases him and the latter fails to defeat the Rikishi. Sheeran ends up getting defeated and is thrown at the edge of the ring, crying in agony with the crowd encouraging him to stand up. Towards the end of the video, Yama wins the match but Pegouskie emerges the scene among the crowd flying into the ring with a karate kick in the air aiming towards Yama as the scene cuts to black with the text that reads \u201cDIRECTED BY: JASON KOENIG\u201d. Sheeran is last seen at the end of the music video struggling to get up while lying down on the floor, but he fails to do so.\n\n\n\n### Reception[edit]\n\n\nOn 8 May 2017, 97 days after its release, it became one of the fastest music videos to reach 1\u00a0billion views on YouTube, and as of April 2023, the music video has over 6\u00a0billion views on the site and is the site's fifth most-watched video as well as the second most-watched music video.[82]\n\n\n\n## Live performances[edit]\n\n\nSheeran performed \"Shape of You\" on *Saturday Night Live* on 11 February 2017 and at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards the following day.[83][84] On 27 February, Sheeran performed the song on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon*, with Fallon and The Roots, who used classroom instruments.[85] On 6 July, Sheeran performed the track on US breakfast television show *Today*.[86] On 27 August, Sheeran performed \"Shape of You\" at 2017 MTV Video Music Awards in a medley with Lil Uzi Vert and his song \"XO Tour Llif3\".[87] At the NRJ Music Awards 2017 on 4 November, he performed \"Shape of You\" in a medley with Soprano and his song \"Fresh Prince\".\n\n\n\n## Remixes and covers[edit]\n\n\nThe official remix of \"Shape of You\" features newly additional verses and guest vocals by English grime artist Stormzy.

It has received Latin Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Urban Fusion/Performance, and Best Short Form Music Video at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards. \"Despacito\" has been also ranked among the best Latin songs of all time and the best songs of 2017 by various publications, which referred to it as one of the most successful Spanish-language tracks in pop music history.\n\n\nThe song topped the charts of 47 countries and reached the top 10 of six others. In the United States, it became the first song primarily in Spanish to top the *Billboard* Hot 100 since Los del R\u00edo's \"Macarena\" in 1996, subsequently tying the longest-reigning number one on the *Billboard* Hot 100 at the time with 16 weeks, as well as becoming the longest-running number-one on the Hot Latin Songs chart with 56 weeks. It also became the first Latin song to receive a diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. The music video shows both artists performing the song in La Perla neighborhood of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico and local bar La Factor\u00eda. It was the most-viewed YouTube video of all time from August 2017 to November 2020 and became the first video on the site to reach the milestones of three, four, five, six, seven, and eight billion views. It is now the second most-viewed video on the site, with \"Baby Shark\" by Pinkfong being the most-viewed.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Original version[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender (*pictured*) co-wrote the song.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Despacito\" were written in late 2015 in Luis Fonsi's house in Miami because he wanted to record a \"swinging song\" for his new album after two years without releasing new music.[3][4] He woke up mulling about \"a song called 'Despacito'\" and invited Brazilian-Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender to a songwriting session.[5] Fonsi co-wrote the song on a Gibson Emmylou Harris guitar.[6] He originally composed it as a cumbia and pop song with lyrics written as a ballad but decided to give it an \"urban injection\" and sent a demo to reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee.[4] They recorded the song at Noisematch Studios in Miami in late 2016.[7][8] Daddy Yankee improvised his verse in a corner of the studio's control room while thinking about his father playing bongos and wrote the post-chorus.[8][9] It was produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andr\u00e9s Torres; the former is known as a member of Colombian pop duo Cali y El Dandee and the latter is known for previously working with David Bisbal, Thal\u00eda, and Ricky Martin.[10][11] It was mixed by American engineer Jaycen Joshua at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles.[12]\n\n\nLuis Fonsi does not consider it a reggaeton song but feels that \"it does have a reggaeton energy and an subtle urban beat\".[4] Ender stated that the track \"went through several arrangements\" until Fonsi got \"exactly the arrangement he wanted\".[5] Fonsi described \"Despacito\" as a very melodic song that can adapt well to many other music genres.[13] Due to the sensual nature of the song, they \"needed to be responsible with a good lyric\" and Ender's approach to writing for Fonsi was \"to take care of how to say things with a good taste\".[3] In April 2017, American singer and songwriter Nicky Jam revealed that the original version of \"Despacito\" featured him instead of Daddy Yankee, but had to decline due to the song's release interfering with the launch of his album *F\u00e9nix*.[14]\n\n\n\n### Justin Bieber remix version[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| \"Despacito (remix)\" |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Single by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber |\n| from the album  *Vida*  |\n| Language | * Spanish\n* English\n |\n| Released | April 17, 2017 |\n| Recorded | April 13, 2017 |\n| Studio | * Noisematch (Miami, U.S.)\n* Audiovisi\u00f3n (Bogot\u00e1, Colombia)\n |\n| Genre | * Reggaeton\n* Latin pop\n |\n| Length | 3:48 |\n| Label | * Republic\n* RBMG\n* Def Jam\n* School Boy\n |\n| Songwriter(s) | * Rodr\u00edguez\n* Ender\n* Ayala\n* Justin Bieber\n* Jason Boyd\n* Marty James\n |\n| Producer(s) | * Rengifo\n* Torres\n* Josh Gudwin\n |\n| Luis Fonsi singles chronology |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \"Wave Your Flag\" (2017)\n | \"**Despacito (remix)**\" (2017)\n | \"Kissing Strangers (remix)\" (2017)\n |\n\n |\n|  |\n| Daddy Yankee singles chronology |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \"Despacito\"(2017)\n | \"**Despacito (remix)**\"(2017)\n | \"Vuelve\"(2017)\n |\n\n |\n| Justin Bieber singles chronology |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \"Deja Vu\"(2016)\n | \"**Despacito (remix)**\"(2017)\n | \"I'm the One\"(2017)\n |\n\n |\n| Remix audio |\n| \"Despacito (remix)\" on YouTube |\n|  |\n\n\nThree months after the release of \"Despacito\", Canadian singer Justin Bieber wanted to record a remix version after hearing the song in a Colombian nightclub during a tour in South America.[15] The following day, Luis Fonsi received a phone call from Universal Latin about the intentions for remix and authorized the label to send the track to Bieber.[16] Bieber's manager Scooter Braun contacted his vocal producer Josh Gudwin to work on the song, who flew to Bogot\u00e1 and recorded Justin Bieber's vocals at Estudios Audiovisi\u00f3n.[17]\n\n\nJustin Bieber sang in Spanish for the first time in his career with the help of Colombian musician Juan Felipe Samper.[18][19] What was most difficult for Justin Bieber was the 'ere' (\u027e) sound in words like \"laberinto\" (labyrinth), \"paredes\" (walls) and \"manuscrito\" (manuscript).[19] Samper wrote the Spanish-language lyrics phonetically to ease Bieber's pronunciation, which was \"perfectly\" achieved in two hours.[19] After a four-hour recording session, Gudwin sent Bieber's vocal tracks to Australian sound engineer Chris O'Ryan for vocal tuning.[17] Gudwin concluded the remix's production in Parrot Cay, Turks and Caicos Islands with the mixing of Luis Fonsi's English-language vocals, whose lyrics were written by American songwriter Marty James.[17] The entire process until the release date took six days.[17] In June 2017, English musician Ed Sheeran revealed that he wanted to record a remix version of the song but lost out to Justin Bieber.[20]\n\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\n\"Despacito\" is a reggaeton and Latin pop song composed in common time (**4**  \n**4** time) with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds and written in the key of B minor[21] with a tempo of 89 beats per minute and a common chord progression of Bm\u2014G\u2014D\u2014A.[22][23][24] The vocals span from F#3 to B4.[25] Its implicit lyrics are about having a sexual relationship in a smooth and romantic way, making heavy use of allegories.[26] However, Luis Fonsi expressed that some lines are free for interpretation.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Despacito\" (original version) sample\n\n\nPartial bridge and partial chorus of \"Despacito\"\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nMauricio Rengifo and Andr\u00e9s Torres produced \"Despacito\" using Pro Tools and the final mix consisted of 47 tracks.[28] The song begins with a Puerto Rican cuatro played by Christian Nieves, which is accompanied by an acoustic guitar played by Torres when Luis Fonsi starts performing.[28] Rengifo stated that the guitar \"was actually played, but then [they] chopped it and made it really digital.\"[28] The producers decided to record a cuatro because they wanted \"to feel very Puerto Rican and ethnic\" and that it \"gives the song a really unique character.\"[28] Nieves played salsa-influenced melodies during the chorus and the hook, which contains \"old school pop\" effects based on American producer Dr. Luke.[28] Percussion instruments guache and g\u00fcira were synchronized with a hi hat in order to highlight the track's cumbia influences.[28]\n\n\nThe song uses the side-chaining production technique in order to make the chorus \"more prominent,\" silencing the music as the kick drum hits.[29] It also makes heavy use of text painting when the music is slowed down as the word \"despacito\" (slowly) is performed at the beginning of every chorus.[29] Its percussion consists of guache, cowbell, timbales, g\u00fcira, and sequenced drum patterns.[28] The remix featuring Justin Bieber maintained the original rhythms and Luis Fonsi translated some lines to English, singing a verse in Spanglish, while Daddy Yankee's verses were kept from the original version.[18]\n\n\n\n## Release and reception[edit]\n\n\n\"Despacito\" was made available for digital download on January 13, 2017, by Universal Music Latin. Some music publications believed the single's success was influenced by a trend of combining Latin pop and urban music.[30] Fonsi referred to it as \"the new pop\" and Ender said that \"everyone is making this type of fusions.\"[3] Luis Fonsi also stated that two weeks after the release of the song and its music video he started receiving calls from \"people who normally don't call, people who only call when something different is going on.\" He got calls from Ricky Martin, Juan Luis Guerra, Marc Anthony and other artists telling him that the track was a \"home run.\"[31]\n\n\nSebastian Wernke-Schmiesing of *Dance-Charts* journal stated that \"a simple 4/4 time, Spanish guitar sounds, a crisp bass, and the excellent vocals by Luis Fonsi and [Daddy Yankee] were enough to get a hit single from the start.\"[32] Leila Cobo of *Billboard* praised its \"undeniable immediate catchiness\" and wrote that the song \"is a clever blend of romantic Latin pop with a reggaeton beat and subtly naughty lyrics.\"[33][34] Robert Joffred of Medium's culture blog That Good You Need highlighted the use of a steel-string guitar to play flamenco-style melodies instead of a nylon-string guitar, as well as the presence of \"swung rhythms\" when the word \"Despacito\" is sung at the beginning of the chorus[29] He referred to the text painting as \"pretty genius.\"[29] Raisa Bruner of *Time* magazine described the single as \"an infectious Latin melody amped up with reggaeton grooves and an irresistible dance tune.\"[35]\n\n\nSpanish record producer Nah\u00fam Garc\u00eda stated that \"the way the rhythm breaks before the chorus is genius\" and that this \"trick\" in particular is not common in pop music.[36] Joshua Barrie of *Irish Mirror* gave a negative opinion about the lyrics, referring to them as \"quite rude and a bit creepy\" and stating that \"some people might find them offensive.\"[37] On the other hand, an editor of Spanish music website Jenesaispop stated that \"the melody is very good, the lyrics are sexy without being vulgar and above all its structure is interesting.\"[38] Felix Contreras of National Public Radio praised the writing, arrangement and performances.[39]\n\n\nThe remix version featuring Justin Bieber was released on April 17, 2017, by Universal Music Latin, Republic Records, Def Jam Recordings, RBMG and Schoolboy Records.[40] Its official audio video garnered 20 million views on YouTube on its first 24 hours, making it the third-highest debut for a music-related video in 2017 as of September.[41] Caroline Soriano of *Ernstars* magazine stated that Bieber's voice \"sounds appealing with the song,\" whose remix version make it sound \"a little bit better.\"[42] Mike Senior of *Sound on Sound* gave a negative review of the remix's mixing by criticizing its polarity inversion regarding the original version and Justin Bieber's louder vocal track than Daddy Yankee's.[43] As to the original version, Senior referred to the first appearance of the \"Despacito\" hook line as a \"masterstroke\".[43]\n\n\nIn July 2017, officials from the Government of Malaysia reported that \"Despacito\" was being banned from airing on government-owned broadcast stations as a result of public complaints.[44] Government ministers said that the song was considered un-Islamic and that its lyrics were \"not suitable to be heard.\"[44]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of awards and nominations received by Daddy Yankee and List of awards and nominations received by Justin Bieber\n\n\"Despacito\" has received various awards and nominations following its commercial success.

the influence of the single's success for the Latin music domination in the US mainstream market during 2017, as 11 primarily-Spanish-language songs debuted on the Hot 100.[77] American songwriter Desmond Child and Cuban musician Rudy P\u00e9rez expressed that \"not since Ricky Martin's 'Livin' La Vida Loca' has there been a song in any genre that has had the global impact of 'Despacito', changing the course of pop music forever.\"[50] In 2017, six out of the 10 most-viewed YouTube music videos were for songs performed in Spanish by Latin artists and *Billboard*'s Lars Brandle referred to it as \"the 'Despacito' effect.\"[134]\n\n\nBritish Official Charts Company recognized it as the song that \"helped Latin pop crossover to the mainstream once again.\"[135] Nielsen's Erin Crawford

\"hastened a massive historical turn in American music, demonstrating the mainstream viability of Spanish-language pop.\"[60] John Ochoa of *Rolling Stone* stated that \"the resulting so-called 'Despacito effect' has advanced a wave of subsequent Spanish-language hits and mainstream crossovers.\"[61]\n\n\nThe Recording Industry Association of America reported that Latin music revenues grew 37% in 2017, mostly due to music streaming.[136] Latin music's consumption in the United States increased 15% between the first half of 2016 and the first half of 2018.[137] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that revenue in Latin America grew 17.7% in 2017 and described \"Despacito\" as a \"game-changing hit.\"[121] In 2018, eight out of the 10 most-viewed YouTube music videos of the year were for songs performed in Spanish and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation referred to it as \"the 'Despacito' effect.\"[138][139]\n\n\nSony/ATV Music Publishing President Jorge Mej\u00eda stated that the song marked a \"before and after\" in the global consumption of Latin music.[140] Before its success, Sony \"had a big Latin single roughly every two years,\" a situation that reverted into an \"avalanche of Latin songs around the world.\"[140] Andrew Unterberger of *Billboard* stated that \"2017 was the year that Latin pop took over the United States\" due to the song and its quick impact on \"Mi Gente\", Camila Cabello's \"Havana\", and the chart performance of acts including Maluma, Ozuna and Bad Bunny, who achieved their biggest hits in the country.[141]\n\n\nIn July 2017, it was reported that tourist interest in Puerto Rico increased by 45% since the worldwide success of the song.[142][143] Tour operators cite the song's music video for increasing interest in locations such as Club La Factor\u00eda and La Perla district in Old San Juan, which were featured in the video.[144]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\n###

EFE stated that the music video \"highlights some of the main cultural and folkloric symbols of Puerto Rico\" by showing its \"splendid beaches, the colorful landscape of La Perla, the rattle of the Puerto Rican cuatro and the barrels of the autochthonous genre of bomba, Zuleyka Rivera's hips movement and a pair of men enjoying a game of dominoes.\"[147]\n\n\n\n### Synopsis[edit]\n\n\nThe video shows both artists performing the song while participating on different parties on the island, featuring model Zuleyka Rivera.[148] The clip starts with shots of La Perla's coast during daylight while showing Zuleyka Rivera arriving at the shanty town on foot. Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee perform the song in a street while elders are playing dominos, a child is getting his hair cut, two people are talking while listening to the radio, and couples are dancing in the background. The video intercalates with shots of Fonsi and Daddy Yankee singing in front of a car with people sitting on it and dancing next to it. As Daddy Yankee is finishing his verse, Zuleyka Rivera enters La Factor\u00eda bar while the artists are performing and dancing alongside other people, and men are playing bomba drums.[147] Fonsi proceeds to dance with Rivera as the song ends. The outro consists of Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee singing the hook a cappella with the people at the bar.[147]\n\n\n\n### Release and reception[edit]\n\n\nThe official music video on YouTube was released on Fonsi's channel on January 12, 2017, and amassed one billion views in 97 days, becoming the second-fastest video on the site to reach the milestone.[149][150][151] It also became the fastest video on YouTube to surpass two billion views, with 154 days.[152] The clip became the first on YouTube to receive three, four, five, and six billion views on August 4, 2017; October 11, 2017; April 5, 2018; and February 24, 2019, respectively *(dates are based on UTC)*.[153][154][155][156] It has received over 8 billion views as of November 11, 2022, and was the most-viewed video on the site from August 4, 2017, until November 2, 2020, when Pinkfong's video for \"Baby Shark\" surpassed it, dethroning it to second place.[149][157][158] It is also the site's most-liked video, with over 50 million likes as of October 23, 2022.[159] On Vevo, the music video received 5.14 million views in its first 24 hours of release, which the website reported as being the most for a Spanish-language video's first day on its platform.[65]\n\n\nThe music video received a Latin Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards and a *Billboard* Music Award for Top Streaming Song (Video) at the 25th *Billboard* Music Awards, and was nominated for an American Music Award for Video of the Year at the 45th American Music Awards.[45][46][49]\n\n\n\n## Live performances[edit]\n\n\nLuis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee performed \"Despacito\" live together for the first time at the 2017 *Billboard* Latin Music Awards on April 27, 2017, and later on *The Voice* season 12 finals on May 23, 2017.[160][161] The only live performance by Justin Bieber and Luis Fonsi was at the Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in Puerto Rico on April 18, 2017, during the former's Purpose World Tour.[162] Bieber was not able to sing the song during live performances and was caught replacing portions of the lyrics with the word \"blah\" and nonsensical ramblings during one performance in a much publicized incident.[163] Fonsi has defended him for not knowing the lyrics, saying that he has to be given \"a little bit of a pass\" because Spanish is not Bieber's main language.[164]\n\n\nLuis Fonsi performed \"Despacito\" on American talk show *Conan* on June 12, 2017 -his first late-night television appearance in the United States- and on *The Ellen DeGeneres Show* on September 14, 2017.[165][166] He also performed the song with random lyrics alongside American television host Jimmy Fallon on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* on January 30, 2019.[167]\n\n\nBoth Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee included the song on their setlists for the 2017\u201318 Love + Dance World Tour and the 2017 Tamo En Vivo Europe Tour, respectively.[168][169][170] On November 16, 2017, Luis Fonsi sang \"Despacito\" featuring Puerto Rican singer Victor Manuelle, Colombian band Bomba Est\u00e9reo and American disc jockey Diplo at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards.[171] On January 28, 2018, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee performed the song at the 60th Grammy Awards on the Madison Square Garden, becoming the 12th and 13th Latin artists ever to perform at the Grammy Awards.[172][173] Fonsi also participated on United States President Joe Biden's inauguration by performing \"Despacito\" at the *Celebrating America* special on January 20, 2021.[174]\n\n\n\n## Other remixes and cover versions[edit]\n\n\nThe first two official remixes for \"Despacito\" were released on March 17, 2017: a solo pop version by Fonsi and a salsa version featuring vocals by Puerto Rican musician V\u00edctor Manuelle.[175] Two other remixes were released on May 5, 2017: an electronic dance version produced by American trio Major Lazer and Colombian DJ MOSKA and an urban version remixed by Colombian producer Sky.[176] A Portuguese-language version written by Erika Ender and performed by Luis Fonsi featuring Brazilian singer Israel Novaes was released on July 14, 2017.[177] A banda version by Luis Fonsi with Mexican group La Bandononona Clave Nueva De Max Peraza was released on September 1, 2017. A Spanish/Mandarin version by Luis Fonsi and Singaporean singer-songwriter JJ Lin was released on January 26, 2018.[178] A Norwegian version was released by Carina Dahl and Adrian J\u00f8rgensen in February 2018.[179] This version was certified Gold by IFPI Norway in 2019 and Platinum in 2021.[180]\n\n\nThe song has been covered by a wide range of artists around the world, including Korean singer J.Fla,[181] a classical crossover by Croatian-based duo 2Cellos,[182] a metal version by Norwegian musician Leo Moracchioli, a piano version by Hungarian pianist and world record-holder Peter Bence,[183] an acoustic version by American band Boyce Avenue[184] and a Broadway-style cover by American musical collective group Postmodern Jukebox.[185] These covers garnered between seven and 47 million views on YouTube except for J.Fla's video, which has 172 million views. Leo Moracchioli's version peaked at number 35 on the Hungarian Single Top 40 chart on August 10, 2017.[186]\n\n\n\n### Political uses[edit]\n\n\nThe song has been used, with altered lyrics, for political purposes. In Argentina, the melody was used by various politicians for their respective TV advertisements for the 2017 midterm elections, by scientists to protest against President Mauricio Macri and by feminists as an initiative to convoke people to a concentration about violence against women.[187][188][189] Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro used it to call for voting in the controversial Constituent Assembly election.[190] Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Erika Ender showed their displeasure with the unauthorized use of the song for political purposes in Venezuela, criticizing Maduro's government use of the song as propaganda.[191][192] On August 16, 2017, English television host James Corden remixed the song to comment on American President Donald Trump during his talk show *The Late Late Show with James Corden*.[193] On September 15, 2020, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden played a few bars from the song at a campaign event headlined by Luis Fonsi. In response, Trump tweeted an edited video showing Biden instead playing N.W.A's \"Fuck tha Police\".[194]\n\n\n\u0414\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0432\u0456\u0442\u0443 (\"Somewhere in the world\") was a Ukrainian version of the song, produced featuring children in Drohobych Raion, to encourage the return of Ukrainians working abroad.[195]\n\n\n\n## Credits and personnel[edit]\n\n\n|  |

The song was released as the lead single on January 27, 2016, through Westbury Road and Roc Nation. The song was written by the artists, PartyNextDoor, Monte Moir, Rupert \"Sevn\" Thomas, Allen Ritter, and producer Matthew \"Boi-1da\" Samuels, with additional production from Kuk Harrell and Noah \"40\" Shebib.[1] The dancehall, reggae-pop, and R&B song, contains an interpolation of \"If You Were Here Tonight\" (1985) performed by Alexander O'Neal. Lyrically, the song incorporates themes of working for money, as well as discussing fragile relationships. The song is written in Jamaican Patois and Bajan Creole.[2][3] Three of its writer-producers: Rupert \"Sevn\" Thomas, Matthew \"Boi-1da\" Samuels, and Jahron \"PartyNextDoor\" Brathwaite, are Jamaican Canadians.[4][5]\n\n\nCritical response to \"Work\" was mixed upon release; critics praised its composition and Rihanna's decision to return to her earlier themes of dancehall music, while others were more skeptical of the song's potential as a comeback for the singer. Critical opinion improved over time; the song was included on several year-end lists and nominated for two awards at the 59th Grammy Awards: Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. The song reached number one on the United States' *Billboard* Hot 100 chart, becoming Rihanna's fourteenth number-one single and making her the act with the fourth-most number-one songs on the chart (after The Beatles, Mariah Carey and Elvis Presley). The song remained at the top for nine weeks. The song also peaked at number one in nine additional countries and is certified Platinum or higher in thirteen countries, including 9\u00d7 Platinum in the US, 3\u00d7 Platinum in the UK and Diamond in France. It has also since sold 32.5 million units worldwide, making it one of the best-selling digital singles of all-time.[6]\n\n\nThe song was accompanied by two music videos, which both premiered on February 22, 2016. The first of the two versions was directed by Rihanna's previous collaborator Director X, while the second was directed by Tim Erem. The song was further promoted with live performance's at the 2016 Brit Awards which featured guest appearances from Drake and SZA, the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards, as well as being performed on the Anti World Tour. \"Work\" became the first dancehall song to top the *Billboard* Hot 100 since Rihanna's own \"Rude Boy\" (2010) and was succeeded three weeks later by another dancehall song, Drake's \"One Dance\".\n\n\n\n\n## Background and release[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the release of Rihanna's seventh studio album, *Unapologetic*, and its accompanying tour, Rihanna took a step back from music.[7]\nRihanna aimed to take a hiatus from recording music stating; \"I wanted to have a year to just do whatever I want artistically, creatively,\" Rihanna went on to state that this hiatus lasted a week and she had returned to the recording studio. Following the release of three singles in 2015\u2014\"FourFiveSeconds\" (with Kanye West and Paul McCartney), \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" and \"American Oxygen\"\u2014*Billboard* announced that Rihanna was set to premiere a new single on January 27, 2016, at 8 am EST.[8] That same day, \"Work\" premiered on several radio stations worldwide including the BBC Radio 1 in the United Kingdom. Subsequently, it was made available for digital download in most countries worldwide via the iTunes Store and was added for streaming on Apple Music, Spotify, and Tidal.[9]\n\n\n\n## Writing and recording[edit]\n\n\n\"Work\" was written by PartyNextDoor, Drake, Rihanna, Monte Moir, Rupert \"Sevn\" Thomas, Allen Ritter and Matthew Samuels, and was produced by Boi-1da, Sevn Thomas, Ritter, Kuk Harrell and Noah \"40\" Shebib.[10] In the summer of 2015, Thomas, Ritter, Boi-1da, and Martin Mason, among others, stayed at Drake's house in Los Angeles for a mid-week period. Thomas described the time spent at the home as a \"beat factory, everyone was sitting there working and collaborating with each other.\"[11]\n\n\nThomas created a beat which was dancehall-influenced; he later played it for Boi-1da to which he positively responded, \"We're both Jamaican-Canadian. It was just something in our DNA, so it woke him up, and we started remembering all these old dancehall songs from the '90s.\" Boi-1da came with up idea for sampling an \"old school dancehall rhythm\" and after that the chords were made with Ritter and past it, \"everything went organically\". The most recognizable sampling found in the \"Work\" riddim is from the 1998 riddim \"Sail Away\" which was produced by Richie Stephens and Mikey 2000,[11] interpolating Alexander O'Neal's \"If You Were Here Tonight\".[12]\n\n\nWhen the song's music was finished, Boi-1da sent it to PartyNextDoor who wrote the lyrics, \"he's an incredible writer, and he's Jamaican as well. I think so that's how he's able to come up with those vibes and feels,\" noted Thomas. PartyNextDoor originally wrote the record as a breakup song,[13] after Drake heard the song he loved it and decided to write and record a verse on it. The original reference track contained Braithwaite's vocals and a tweaked verse from Drake. It leaked as a snippet in February 2016,[14] the full version was released online in April 2016.[15] At first the intent was to keep the song as a collaboration between the two or give to Alicia Keys.[16] Shortly after Braithwaite stayed at Rihanna's home in Malibu, where he played her the song,[11] afterwards \"it was all that she could sing around the house\" and it was her \"family's favourite song\".[16]\n\n\nRihanna's vocals were recorded by Marcos Tovar and Kuk Harrell at the Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles; the latter also served as a vocal producer. Drake's vocals were recorded by Noel Cadastre and Noah \"40\" Shebib at the Sandra Gale Studios in California and the SOTA Studios in Toronto. The vocal recording was assisted by Thomas Warren, while additional vocals were provided by PartyNextDoor. Manny Marroquin mixed \"Work\" at the Larrabee Studios, while Noel \"Gadget\" Campbell and Shebib did the mixing at the Studio 360 and SOTA Studios in Toronto. The mastering was done by Chris Gehringer at the Sterling Sound in New York City.[17] \"Work\" marked the third collaboration between Rihanna and Drake, following \"What's My Name?\" in 2010 and \"Take Care\" in 2012.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Composition and lyrical interpretation[edit]\n\n\n\"Work\" is a dancehall,[19] reggae-pop[20] and R&B[21] song, with a length of three minutes and thirty-nine seconds.[22][23] Hugh McIntyre of *Forbes* described the song as \"quite\" urban and mixes hip hop influences with \"island vibes\".[24] Zach Frydenlund of *Complex* wrote that the song \"is slower and very rhythmic with Rihanna showing off her vocal skills over the crafty production.\"[25] The song is written in the key of C# Dorian (same key signature as G\u266f minor) in common time with a tempo of 92 beats per minute. The vocals in the song span from F\u266f3 to E\u266d5.[26] Alexa Camp of *Slant Magazine* called it \"an understated midtempo jam in the vein of Janet Jackson's recent 'No Sleeep', with a percolating beat, sinuous synth lines, and vocal samples stretched and pulled in a way that recalls Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis's masterful production work on Janet's 1997 album *The Velvet Rope*.\"[27] *The Guardian*'s Harriet Gibsone wrote: \"The glossy, modernist 'Work' skewers elements of dub and dancehall: her voice is at times Auto-Tuned, and a distant sample of what sounds a little like Grace Jones's \"My Jamaican Guy\" haunts its empty spaces.\"[28]\n\n\n*Rolling Stone*'s Daniel Kreps wrote the song contains \"a tropical house vibe\".[29] In contrary, Taj Ran from *Billboard* wrote the song \"isn't part of a new genre that many in the mainstream media are calling 'tropical house.' *Anti*'s lead single is undeniably drenched in dancehall, a genre with deep roots in Jamaica's club scene that spun off from reggae in the 1970s.\"[30] According to *The Atlantic*'s Spencer Kornhaber, the single has \"strangely unfinished quality\" that features its verses, choruses and bridge fade into themselves, \"forgoing soft-to-loud explosions or exciting rhythmic changes\".[31] He also noted that, Boi-1da also tries to create \"escalation\" in the song by adding additional drums for the second chorus, flutes, autotuned harmonies and back-off piano.[31] *The New York Times*' Jon Caramanica noted Rihanna at times \"barely even relies on words, truncating her syllables past patois to something far less exact.\"[32] Lyrically, \"Work\" is \"about working for a paycheck no matter what else is going on in your life.\"[31] Additionally, it focuses on \"a fragile relationship\" that can be seen in the lines, \"If I get another chance to, I would never, oh never, neglect you,\" which Rihanna sings.[20]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n\"Work\" has received mixed reviews from critics. Editor Joe Lynch wrote that the track finds Rihanna \"reteaming with frequent collaborator/ex Drake, but that's the only predictable thing about this song\u2014while it's hardly a 180-degree turn for Rih, its minimal production subverts expectations of what you'd expect a major pop star to release when they're gearing up to drop their long-delayed new album.\"[33] Alexa Camp of *Slant Magazine* wrote: \"the new track has the potential to at least partly justify the gold crown on the album's cover.\"[27] BET's Kathy Iandoli called the song \"comfortable, but still good.\"[34] *Spin*'s Brennan Carley thought Rihanna made the \"lackadaisical song gel.\"[35] Other critics were more skeptical. Hugh McIntyre of *Forbes* wrote \"It's a well-produced song, but is it the pop hit that she needed?\"[24] Idolator's Robbie Daw's review was mixed, writing \"Musically, the track is a charming, if also somewhat sparse, affair that feels like it blew in on a tropical, warm June wind and nestled up beside our ears.\"[36]\n\n\nRobin Reiff of *The A.V. Club* wrote: \"the sheer repetition of the hook creates a built-in expiration date for when this song transitions from catchy to mildly annoying.\"[37]\nTaj Rani of *Billboard* stated \"Work\" has brought the genre of dancehall to the forefront of American music (again), as it became the first dancehall song to top the *Billboard* Hot 100 since Sean Paul's \"Temperature\" in 2006. She opined that the song is a prime example of \"an unapologetic black woman proudly showing her heritage at a time when our politics are dominated by #BlackLivesMatter and Donald Trump's racist, xenophobic and misogynistic tirades.\" Rani continued to state that although mainstream critics are uncomfortable with Rihanna's use of patois (describing it as \"gibberish\"), she is able to display West Indian culture front and center without appropriation from mainstream culture.[38]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n*Rolling Stone* named \"Work\" one of the 30 best songs of the first half of 2016: \"What would even you call a minimalist banger? One of America's most reliable singles artists created an arch, moody album instead of a handful of chart-ready pop confections, but we still couldn't resist this barely-there tune with a beat like a dancehall wisp and lyrics like a freestyle.\"[39]\nThe Guardian named it \"Best track of 2016\", writing: \"Work was off-kilter, lacked a big chorus and weaved in a dubious 80s ballad. It also clicked perfectly, a song that captured two era-defining artists and one all the more infectious for its rule-defying restraint.\"[40]\nThe British magazine *NME* named \"Work\" the best song of 2016 in their year-end critics' poll.[41] *NPR* and *Consequence of Sound* both place the song at number fifteen on their year end lists.[42][43] For *Pitchfork* it was the seventh best song of the year.[44] *Billboard* ranked \"Work\" at number 25 on their \"100 Best Pop Songs of 2016\" list: \"Its hypnotic chorus burrowing its way into the year's subconscious.\"[45] In the annual *Village Voice*'s Pazz & Jop mass critics poll of the year's best in music in 2016, \"Work\" was tied at number 9, with David Bowie's \"Blackstar\".[46]\n\"Work\" has been nominated for the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and the Record of the Year at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.[47] \"Work\" won the awards for \"R&B Song of the Year\" and \"Best Collaboration\" at the 2017 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[48]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\n\"Work\" debuted at number nine on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart issue dated February 13, 2016. It became the 27th top-ten hit for Rihanna and 15th for Drake. With this feat, Rihanna tied Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson and Elton John as the artists with the fifth-most top-ten songs on the chart.[49] The singer scored 27 top-ten singles on the Hot 100 in a span of 10 years and eight months between her first single, \"Pon de Replay\" and \"Work\", and became the fastest solo artist to reach the plateau.[50] It also became Rihanna's 50th song to chart on the Hot 100.[*citation needed*] \"Work\" debuted at number one on the US *Billboard* Digital Songs chart with over 126,000 downloads sold in only just over a day of tracking. Additionally, \"Work\" launched at number 27 on the US *Billboard* Radio Songs chart with 44 million audience impressions, becoming the highest debut of her career. \n\n\nThe following week, \"Work\" sold an additional 156,000 copies and moved up to number seven on the Hot 100 chart.[51] In its third week, \"Work\" jumped 7\u20134 on the Hot 100 chart, earning Rihanna rihanna her milestone 20th top-five hit, tying her with Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder as the artists with the fifth-most top-five songs on the chart[52] In its fourth week, \"Work\" reached the summit of the Hot 100 chart and became Rihanna's fourteenth number-one song in the United States. Subsequently, she became the artist with the fourth-most number-one songs on the chart following The Beatles with 20, Mariah Carey with 19 and Elvis Presley with 18 chart toppers. She broke a tie with Michael Jackson, who had reached 13 chart-toppers on the *Billboard* Hot 100 in his lifetime. Additionally, \"Work\" became Drake's second number-one single on the chart, the previous being the pair's 2010 collaboration, \"What's My Name?\". For the same issue, it rose to number 10 on the Radio Songs chart and became her 24th top-ten single, surpassing Mariah Carey's lead of 23 top-tens on that chart. The song remained at number-one on the Hot 100 for nine consecutive weeks and was unseated by Desiigner's \"Panda\".[53]\n\n\nThe song was most successful on the *Billboard* Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs where it debuted atop the chart, becoming Rihanna's fifth chart-topper and Drake's fourteenth.[49] As of January 2021, \"Work\" has accumulated over 1.4\u00a0billion streams and 1,906,000 downloads in the United States.[54]\n\n\nIn France, \"Work\" peaked at number one on the chart for two weeks, becoming Rihanna's sixth number-one in the country, the second-highest amount of all time. The single also broke the record for the most streams in a single week, with 2.056 million streams.[55]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nDirector X (left) directed the first of the song's two accompanying videos which was filmed in The Real Jerk restaurant (right)\n\nTwo music videos were released for the single; the first was directed by Director X who had previously worked with Rihanna on her debut video \"Pon de Replay\"[56] while the second was directed by Tim Erem.[57] Harv Glazer and Melissa Larsen served as a producer of the visual, while Daniel Bouquet and Alexi Zabes were the director of photography. Laura McMillan and Nick Rondeau were the editors of the video, while Nick Cortes served as the production coordinator. Missy Galanida, Isaac Rice and Taj Critchlow, served as the videos executive producers while Dave Hussey of Company 3 was the colorist.[58]\n\n\nRihanna later announced its premiere date to be February 22, 2016 via her Twitter account, while also releasing a videoclip via YouTube.[59]\nFilming of the first accompanying music video took place at the Real Jerk restaurant in Toronto on February 5.[60]\nDirector X stated that when filming the video they wanted to make it look like they were in a West Indian neighborhood, in a West Indian restaurant.[61]\nThe second video for the single directed by Tim Erem was discussed between the director, Rihanna and Drake in the studio at 4 a.m., where they were attempting to come up with ideas to add a tropical vibe to their already existing footage. After thirty minutes they came up with the idea of shooting a video in a whole pink room.[62]\n\n\nThe first video opens with a shot of \"The Real Jerk\" carpark, in which Rihanna and Drake enter separately.

The song was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards[5] being listed as one of the best songs of the year by *Uproxx[6]* and 3voor12.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2016, the Chainsmokers shared three short clips of an upcoming song featuring vocals from Chris Martin.[8] On February 22, 2017, Spotify prematurely posted a banner ad at the top of the site's home page with a Listen Now button.[9]\n\n\nOn the same date, Coldplay premiered \"Something Just Like This\" with the Chainsmokers on stage at the Brit Awards at The O2 Arena in London, England.[10] They then performed the song at the 2017 iHeartRadio Music Awards at The Forum in Inglewood, California on March 5, 2017[11] and on their A Head Full of Dreams Tour since the Singapore show on March 31, 2017.[12] It was performed again at the *One Love Manchester* benefit concert for the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing on June 4, 2017.[13]\n\n\n\n## Lyric video[edit]\n\n\nA lyric video was also released on February 22, 2017 on the Chainsmokers' Vevo channel. It has received over 2.1 billion views and is one of the 70 most viewed videos on YouTube.[14][15] It was directed by James Zwadlo.\n\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\nThe song is written in the key of D major and has a tempo of 103.156 beats per minute in common time. It follows a chord progression of G(add9)\u2013Asus\u2013Bm\u2013Asus, and the vocals span two octaves, from G2 to G4.[16]\n\n\n\n## Chart performance[edit]\n\n\n\"Something Just Like This\" debuted at number 56 on the *Billboard* Hot 100 and soared to number five on its second week, becoming the Chainsmokers' third top five after \"Don't Let Me Down\" and \"Closer\". Meanwhile, it was Coldplay's second top five hit after \"Viva la Vida\", which peaked at number three on the *Billboard* Hot 100 ever since. The song was also the sixth best-selling track of 2017 in the United States with 1,348,000 copies sold.[17] In the United Kingdom, \"Something Just Like This\" debuted at number 30 on 24 February 2017, reaching its number two peak position the following week behind Ed Sheeran's \"Shape of You\". It spent nine consecutive weeks in the top 10 and became the ninth biggest song of the year in the country.[18] The song also set a new record for most weeks atop *Billboard*'s Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart (79).[19]\n\n\n\n## Track listing[edit]\n\n\nDigital download[20]| No. | Title | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | \"Something Just like This\" | 4:07 |\n\nDigital download \u2013
