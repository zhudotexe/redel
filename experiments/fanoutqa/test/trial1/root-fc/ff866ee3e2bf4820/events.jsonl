Founded in 1636 as Harvard College and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard, it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[9]\n\n\nHarvard's founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature, \"dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches\"; though never formally affiliated with any denomination, in its early years, Harvard College primarily trained Congregational clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.\n\n\nThe university is composed of ten academic faculties plus the Harvard Radcliffe Institute. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate academic disciplines, and other faculties offer only graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard has three main campuses:[13]\nthe 209-acre (85 ha) Cambridge campus centered on Harvard Yard; an adjoining campus immediately across Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical campus in Boston's Longwood Medical Area.[14] Harvard's endowment is valued at $50.7 billion, making it the wealthiest academic institution in the world.[3][4] Endowment income enables the undergraduate college to admit students regardless of financial need and provide financial aid with no loans.[15] Harvard Library is the world's largest academic library system, comprising 79 individual libraries holding 20 million items.[16][17][18][19]\n\n\nThroughout its existence, Harvard alumni, faculty, and researchers have included 188 living billionaires, 8 U.S. presidents, numerous heads of state, Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, members of Congress, MacArthur Fellows, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Turing Award Recipients and Fulbright Scholars; by most metrics, Harvard ranks among the top globally in each of these categories.[Notes 1] Additionally, students and alumni have won 10 Academy Awards, 48 Pulitzer Prizes, 110 Olympic medals (46 gold), and have founded notable companies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Harvard University\n\n### Colonial era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: John Harvard (clergyman)\n\n![](image)The Harvard Corporation seal found on Harvard diplomas. *Christo et Ecclesiae* (Latin: \"For Christ and Church\") is one of Harvard's several early mottoes.[20]\n![](image)Engraving of Harvard College by Paul Revere, 1767\nHarvard was founded in 1636 during the colonial, pre-Revolutionary era by vote of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony. Its first headmaster, Nathaniel Eaton, took office the following year. In 1638, the university acquired British North America's first known printing press.[21][22]\n\n\nIn 1639, it was named Harvard College after John Harvard, an English clergyman who had died soon after immigrating to Massachusetts, bequeathing it £780 and his library of some 320 volumes.[23] The charter creating Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.\n\n\nA 1643 publication defined the college's purpose: \"to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust.\"[24] The college trained many Puritan ministers in its early years[25] and offered a classic curriculum based on the English university model—many leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge‍—‌conformed to the tenets of Puritanism. Harvard never affiliated with any particular denomination.[26]\n\n\nIncrease Mather served as Harvard College's president from 1681 to 1701. In 1708, John Leverett became the first president who was not also a clergyman.[27]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Harvard statue on Harvard Yard\nIn the 19th century, Enlightenment ideas of reason and free will were widespread among Congregational ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations at odds with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties.[28]: 1–4 When Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and President Joseph Willard died a year later, a struggle broke out over their replacements. Henry Ware was elected Hollis chair in 1805, and liberal Samuel Webber was appointed president two years later, signaling a shift from traditional ideas at Harvard to liberal, Arminian ideas.[28]: 4–5[29]: 24\n\n\nCharles William Eliot, Harvard president from 1869 to 1909, decreased the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. Though Eliot was an influential figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated more by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions influenced by William Ellery Channing, Ralph Waldo Emerson and others of the time, than by secularism.[30]\n\n\nIn 1816, Harvard launched new programs in the study of French and Spanish with George Ticknor as first professor for these language programs.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1906 watercolor painting of the campus, facing northeast[31]\nHarvard's graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers in the late 19th century. During World War II, students at Radcliffe College (which, since its 1879 founding, had been paying Harvard professors to repeat their lectures for women) began attending Harvard classes alongside men.[32] In 1945, women were first admitted to the medical school.[33]\nSince 1971, Harvard had controlled essentially all aspects of undergraduate admission, instruction, and housing for Radcliffe women; in 1999, Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard.[34]\n\n\nIn the 20th century, Harvard's reputation grew as its endowment burgeoned and prominent intellectuals and professors affiliated with the university. The university's rapid enrollment growth also was a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the undergraduate college. Radcliffe College emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities.[12]\n\n\nThe student body in its first decades of the 20th century was predominantly \"old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians\", according to sociologist and author Jerome Karabel.[35] In 1923, a year after the percentage of Jewish students at Harvard reached 20%, President A. Lawrence Lowell supported a policy change that would have capped the admission of Jewish students to 15% of the undergraduate population. But Lowell's idea was rejected. Lowell also refused to mandate forced desegregation in the university's freshman dormitories, writing that, \"We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man, but we do not owe to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial.\"[36][37][38][39]\n\n\nPresident James B. Conant led the university from 1933 to 1953; Conant reinvigorated creative scholarship in an effort to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among the nation and world's emerging research institutions. Conant viewed higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy. As such, he devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. An influential 268-page report issued by Harvard faculty in 1945 under Conant's leadership, *General Education in a Free Society*, remains one the most important works in curriculum studies.[40]\n\n\nBetween 1945 and 1960, admissions standardized to open the university to a more diverse group of students; for example, after World War II, special exams were developed so veterans could be considered for admission.[41] No longer drawing mostly from select New England prep schools, the undergraduate college became accessible to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but still few Blacks, Hispanics, or Asians versus the representation of these groups in the general population.[42] Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, Harvard incrementally became vastly more diverse.[43]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nDrew Gilpin Faust, who was dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute, became Harvard's first female president on July 1, 2007.[44] In 2018, Faust retired and joined the board of Goldman Sachs.\n\n\nOn July 1, 2018, Lawrence Bacow was appointed Harvard's 29th president.[45] Bacow intends to retire in 2023. \n\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Claudine Gay, a Harvard University political scientist and former dean of Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, succeeded Bacow as the university's 30th president.\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Hall\n### Cambridge[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Graduate School of Design, Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Radcliffe Institute\n\nHarvard's 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard (\"the Yard\") in Cambridge, about 3 miles (5 km) west-northwest of downtown Boston, and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood. The Yard contains administrative offices such as University Hall and Massachusetts Hall; libraries such as Widener, Pusey, Houghton, and Lamont; and Memorial Church.\n\n\n\nThe Yard and adjacent areas include the main academic buildings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including the college, such as Sever Hall and Harvard Hall.\n\n![](image)Memorial ChurchFreshman dormitories are in, or adjacent to, the Yard. Upperclassmen live in the twelve residential houses – nine south of the Yard near the Charles River, the others half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Radcliffe Quadrangle (which formerly housed Radcliffe College students). Each house is a community of undergraduates, faculty deans, and resident tutors, with its own dining hall, library, and recreational facilities.[46]\n\n\nAlso in Cambridge are the Law, Divinity (theology), Engineering and Applied Science, Design (architecture), Education, Kennedy (public policy), and Extension schools, as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Radcliffe Yard.[47]\nHarvard also has commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Allston[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard University's expansion in Allston, Massachusetts\n\nHarvard Business School, Harvard Innovation Labs, and many athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a 358-acre (145 ha) campus in Allston,[50]\na Boston neighborhood just across the Charles River from the Cambridge campus. The John W. Weeks Bridge, a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River, connects the two campuses.\n\n\nThe university is actively expanding into Allston, where it now owns more land than in Cambridge.[51]\nPlans include new construction and renovation for the Business School, a hotel and conference center, graduate student housing, Harvard Stadium, and other athletics facilities.[52]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will expanded into a new, 500,000+ square foot Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) in Allston.[53]\nThe SEC will be adjacent to the Enterprise Research Campus, the Business School, and the Harvard Innovation Labs to encourage technology- and life science-focused startups as well as collaborations with mature companies.[54]\n\n\n\n### Longwood[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Longwood Medical and Academic Area\n\n![](image)Harvard Medical School\nThe schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Public Health are located on a 21-acre (8.5 ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area in Boston, about 3.3 miles (5.3 km) south of the Cambridge campus.[14]\nSeveral Harvard-affiliated hospitals and research institutes are also in Longwood, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, Joslin Diabetes Center, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. Additional affiliates, most notably Massachusetts General Hospital, are located throughout the Greater Boston area.\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nHarvard owns the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, D.C., Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts, the Concord Field Station in Estabrook Woods in Concord, Massachusetts,[55]\nthe Villa I Tatti research center in Florence, Italy,[56]\nthe Harvard Shanghai Center in Shanghai, China,[57]\nand the Arnold Arboretum in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **School** | **Founded** |\n| Harvard College | 1636\n |\n| Medicine | 1782\n |\n| Divinity | 1816\n |\n| Law | 1817\n |\n| Engineering and Applied Sciences | 1847\n |\n| Dental Medicine | 1867\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | 1872\n |\n| Business | 1908\n |\n| Extension | 1910\n |\n| Design | 1936\n |\n| Education | 1920\n |\n| Public Health | 1913\n |\n| Government | 1936\n |\n\n\n![](image)University seal\nHarvard is governed by a combination of its Board of Overseers and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (also known as the Harvard Corporation), which in turn appoints the President of Harvard University.[58]\nThere are 16,000 staff and faculty,[59]\nincluding 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors.[60]\n\n\nThe Faculty of Arts and Sciences is the largest Harvard faculty and has primary responsibility for instruction in Harvard College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and the Division of Continuing Education, which includes Harvard Summer School and Harvard Extension School. There are nine other graduate and professional faculties as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.\n\n\nJoint programs with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, the Broad Institute, The Observatory of Economic Complexity, and edX.\n\n\n\n### Endowment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard University endowment\n\nHarvard has the largest university endowment in the world, valued at about $50.7 billion as of 2023.[3][4]\nDuring the recession of 2007–2009, it suffered significant losses that forced large budget cuts, in particular temporarily halting construction on the Allston Science Complex.[61]\nThe endowment has since recovered.[62][63][64][65]\n\n\nAbout $2 billion of investment income is annually distributed to fund operations.[66]\nHarvard's ability to fund its degree and financial aid programs depends on the performance of its endowment; a poor performance in fiscal year 2016 forced a 4.4% cut in the number of graduate students funded by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.[67]\nEndowment income is critical, as only 22% of revenue is from students' tuition, fees, room, and board.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Divestment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Financial endowment § Criticism and reforms\n\nSince the 1970s, several student-led campaigns have advocated divesting Harvard's endowment from controversial holdings, including investments in apartheid South Africa, Sudan during the Darfur genocide, and the tobacco, fossil fuel, and private prison industries.[69][70]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, during the divestment from South Africa movement, student activists erected a symbolic \"shantytown\" on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown.[71][72]\nThe university eventually reduced its South African holdings by $230 million (out of $400 million) in response to the pressure.[71][73]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Teaching and learning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Massachusetts Hall (1720), Harvard's oldest building[74]\n![](image)Harvard Yard\nHarvard is a large, highly residential research university[75]\noffering 50 undergraduate majors,[76]\n134 graduate degrees,[77]\nand 32 professional degrees.[78]\nDuring the 2018–2019 academic year, Harvard granted 1,665 baccalaureate degrees, 1,013 graduate degrees, and 5,695 professional degrees.[78]\n\n\nHarvard College, the four-year, full-time undergraduate program, has a liberal arts and sciences focus.[75][76]\nTo graduate in the usual four years, undergraduates normally take four courses per semester.[79]\nIn most majors, an honors degree requires advanced coursework and a senior thesis.[80]\nThough some introductory courses have large enrollments, the median class size is 12 students.[81]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nHarvard is a founding member of the Association of American Universities[82] and a preeminent research university with \"very high\" research activity (R1) and comprehensive doctoral programs across the arts, sciences, engineering, and medicine according to the Carnegie Classification.[75]\n\n\nWith the medical school consistently ranking first among medical schools for research,[83] biomedical research is an area of particular strength for the university. More than 11,000 faculty and over 1,600 graduate students conduct research at the medical school as well as its 15 affiliated hospitals and research institutes.[84] The medical school and its affiliates attracted $1.65 billion in competitive research grants from the National Institutes of Health in 2019, more than twice as much as any other university.[85]\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Widener Library anchors the Harvard Library system.\n![](image)Henry Moore's sculpture *Large Four Piece Reclining Figure*, near Lamont Library\nThe Harvard Library system is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard and comprises nearly 80 individual libraries holding about 20.4 million items.[16][17][19] According to the American Library Association, this makes it the largest academic library in the world.[17][5]\n\n\nHoughton Library, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials. America's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public. The largest collection of East-Asian language material outside of East Asia is held in the Harvard-Yenching Library\n\n\nThe Harvard Art Museums comprise three museums. The Arthur M.

The Graduate Council represents students at all twelve graduate and professional schools, most of which also have their own student government.[117]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard Crimson\n\nBoth the undergraduate College and the graduate schools have intramural sports programs.\n\n\nHarvard College competes in the NCAA Division I Ivy League conference. The school fields 42 intercollegiate sports teams, more than any other college in the country.[118] Every two years, the Harvard and Yale track and field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford and Cambridge team in the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.[119] As with other Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships.[120] The school color is crimson.\n\n\nHarvard's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875.[121]\n\n\n\n## *Harvard University Gazette*[edit]\n\n\nThe *Harvard Gazette*, also called the ***Harvard University Gazette***, is the official press organ of Harvard University. Formerly a print publication, it is now a web site. It publicizes research, faculty, teaching and events at the university. Initiated in 1906, it was originally a weekly calendar of news and events. In 1968 it became a weekly newspaper.\n\n\nWhen the *Gazette* was a print publication, it was considered a good way of keeping up with Harvard news: \"If weekly reading suits you best, the most comprehensive and authoritative medium is the *Harvard University Gazette*\".\n\n\nIn 2010, the *Gazette* \"shifted from a print-first to a digital-first and mobile-first\" publication, and reduced its publication calendar to biweekly, while keeping the same number of reporters, including some who had previously worked for the *Boston Globe*, *Miami Herald*, and the Associated Press.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images**.

Founded in 1636 as Harvard College and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard, it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[9]\n\n\nHarvard's founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature, \"dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches\"; though never formally affiliated with any denomination, in its early years, Harvard College primarily trained Congregational clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.\n\n\nThe university is composed of ten academic faculties plus the Harvard Radcliffe Institute. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate academic disciplines, and other faculties offer only graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard has three main campuses:[13]\nthe 209-acre (85 ha) Cambridge campus centered on Harvard Yard; an adjoining campus immediately across Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical campus in Boston's Longwood Medical Area.[14] Harvard's endowment is valued at $50.7 billion, making it the wealthiest academic institution in the world.[3][4] Endowment income enables the undergraduate college to admit students regardless of financial need and provide financial aid with no loans.[15] Harvard Library is the world's largest academic library system, comprising 79 individual libraries holding 20 million items.[16][17][18][19]\n\n\nThroughout its existence, Harvard alumni, faculty, and researchers have included 188 living billionaires, 8 U.S. presidents, numerous heads of state, Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, members of Congress, MacArthur Fellows, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Turing Award Recipients and Fulbright Scholars; by most metrics, Harvard ranks among the top globally in each of these categories.[Notes 1] Additionally, students and alumni have won 10 Academy Awards, 48 Pulitzer Prizes, 110 Olympic medals (46 gold), and have founded notable companies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Harvard University\n\n### Colonial era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: John Harvard (clergyman)\n\n![](image)The Harvard Corporation seal found on Harvard diplomas. *Christo et Ecclesiae* (Latin: \"For Christ and Church\") is one of Harvard's several early mottoes.[20]\n![](image)Engraving of Harvard College by Paul Revere, 1767\nHarvard was founded in 1636 during the colonial, pre-Revolutionary era by vote of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony. Its first headmaster, Nathaniel Eaton, took office the following year. In 1638, the university acquired British North America's first known printing press.[21][22]\n\n\nIn 1639, it was named Harvard College after John Harvard, an English clergyman who had died soon after immigrating to Massachusetts, bequeathing it £780 and his library of some 320 volumes.[23] The charter creating Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.\n\n\nA 1643 publication defined the college's purpose: \"to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust.\"[24] The college trained many Puritan ministers in its early years[25] and offered a classic curriculum based on the English university model—many leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge‍—‌conformed to the tenets of Puritanism. Harvard never affiliated with any particular denomination.[26]\n\n\nIncrease Mather served as Harvard College's president from 1681 to 1701. In 1708, John Leverett became the first president who was not also a clergyman.[27]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Harvard statue on Harvard Yard\nIn the 19th century, Enlightenment ideas of reason and free will were widespread among Congregational ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations at odds with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties.[28]: 1–4 When Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and President Joseph Willard died a year later, a struggle broke out over their replacements. Henry Ware was elected Hollis chair in 1805, and liberal Samuel Webber was appointed president two years later, signaling a shift from traditional ideas at Harvard to liberal, Arminian ideas.[28]: 4–5[29]: 24\n\n\nCharles William Eliot, Harvard president from 1869 to 1909, decreased the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. Though Eliot was an influential figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated more by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions influenced by William Ellery Channing, Ralph Waldo Emerson and others of the time, than by secularism.[30]\n\n\nIn 1816, Harvard launched new programs in the study of French and Spanish with George Ticknor as first professor for these language programs.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1906 watercolor painting of the campus, facing northeast[31]\nHarvard's graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers in the late 19th century. During World War II, students at Radcliffe College (which, since its 1879 founding, had been paying Harvard professors to repeat their lectures for women) began attending Harvard classes alongside men.[32] In 1945, women were first admitted to the medical school.[33]\nSince 1971, Harvard had controlled essentially all aspects of undergraduate admission, instruction, and housing for Radcliffe women; in 1999, Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard.[34]\n\n\nIn the 20th century, Harvard's reputation grew as its endowment burgeoned and prominent intellectuals and professors affiliated with the university. The university's rapid enrollment growth also was a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the undergraduate college. Radcliffe College emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities.[12]\n\n\nThe student body in its first decades of the 20th century was predominantly \"old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians\", according to sociologist and author Jerome Karabel.[35] In 1923, a year after the percentage of Jewish students at Harvard reached 20%, President A. Lawrence Lowell supported a policy change that would have capped the admission of Jewish students to 15% of the undergraduate population. But Lowell's idea was rejected. Lowell also refused to mandate forced desegregation in the university's freshman dormitories, writing that, \"We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man, but we do not owe to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial.\"[36][37][38][39]\n\n\nPresident James B. Conant led the university from 1933 to 1953; Conant reinvigorated creative scholarship in an effort to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among the nation and world's emerging research institutions. Conant viewed higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy. As such, he devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. An influential 268-page report issued by Harvard faculty in 1945 under Conant's leadership, *General Education in a Free Society*, remains one the most important works in curriculum studies.[40]\n\n\nBetween 1945 and 1960, admissions standardized to open the university to a more diverse group of students; for example, after World War II, special exams were developed so veterans could be considered for admission.[41] No longer drawing mostly from select New England prep schools, the undergraduate college became accessible to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but still few Blacks, Hispanics, or Asians versus the representation of these groups in the general population.[42] Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, Harvard incrementally became vastly more diverse.[43]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nDrew Gilpin Faust, who was dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute, became Harvard's first female president on July 1, 2007.[44] In 2018, Faust retired and joined the board of Goldman Sachs.\n\n\nOn July 1, 2018, Lawrence Bacow was appointed Harvard's 29th president.[45] Bacow intends to retire in 2023. \n\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Claudine Gay, a Harvard University political scientist and former dean of Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, succeeded Bacow as the university's 30th president.\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Hall\n### Cambridge[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Graduate School of Design, Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Radcliffe Institute\n\nHarvard's 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard (\"the Yard\") in Cambridge, about 3 miles (5 km) west-northwest of downtown Boston, and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood. The Yard contains administrative offices such as University Hall and Massachusetts Hall; libraries such as Widener, Pusey, Houghton, and Lamont; and Memorial Church.\n\n\n\nThe Yard and adjacent areas include the main academic buildings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including the college, such as Sever Hall and Harvard Hall.\n\n![](image)Memorial ChurchFreshman dormitories are in, or adjacent to, the Yard. Upperclassmen live in the twelve residential houses – nine south of the Yard near the Charles River, the others half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Radcliffe Quadrangle (which formerly housed Radcliffe College students). Each house is a community of undergraduates, faculty deans, and resident tutors, with its own dining hall, library, and recreational facilities.[46]\n\n\nAlso in Cambridge are the Law, Divinity (theology), Engineering and Applied Science, Design (architecture), Education, Kennedy (public policy), and Extension schools, as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Radcliffe Yard.[47]\nHarvard also has commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Allston[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard University's expansion in Allston, Massachusetts\n\nHarvard Business School, Harvard Innovation Labs, and many athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a 358-acre (145 ha) campus in Allston,[50]\na Boston neighborhood just across the Charles River from the Cambridge campus. The John W. Weeks Bridge, a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River, connects the two campuses.\n\n\nThe university is actively expanding into Allston, where it now owns more land than in Cambridge.[51]\nPlans include new construction and renovation for the Business School, a hotel and conference center, graduate student housing, Harvard Stadium, and other athletics facilities.[52]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will expanded into a new, 500,000+ square foot Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) in Allston.[53]\nThe SEC will be adjacent to the Enterprise Research Campus, the Business School, and the Harvard Innovation Labs to encourage technology- and life science-focused startups as well as collaborations with mature companies.[54]\n\n\n\n### Longwood[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Longwood Medical and Academic Area\n\n![](image)Harvard Medical School\nThe schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Public Health are located on a 21-acre (8.5 ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area in Boston, about 3.3 miles (5.3 km) south of the Cambridge campus.[14]\nSeveral Harvard-affiliated hospitals and research institutes are also in Longwood, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, Joslin Diabetes Center, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. Additional affiliates, most notably Massachusetts General Hospital, are located throughout the Greater Boston area.\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nHarvard owns the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, D.C., Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts, the Concord Field Station in Estabrook Woods in Concord, Massachusetts,[55]\nthe Villa I Tatti research center in Florence, Italy,[56]\nthe Harvard Shanghai Center in Shanghai, China,[57]\nand the Arnold Arboretum in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **School** | **Founded** |\n| Harvard College | 1636\n |\n| Medicine | 1782\n |\n| Divinity | 1816\n |\n| Law | 1817\n |\n| Engineering and Applied Sciences | 1847\n |\n| Dental Medicine | 1867\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | 1872\n |\n| Business | 1908\n |\n| Extension | 1910\n |\n| Design | 1936\n |\n| Education | 1920\n |\n| Public Health | 1913\n |\n| Government | 1936\n |\n\n\n![](image)University seal\nHarvard is governed by a combination of its Board of Overseers and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (also known as the Harvard Corporation), which in turn appoints the President of Harvard University.[58]\nThere are 16,000 staff and faculty,[59]\nincluding 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors.[60]\n\n\nThe Faculty of Arts and Sciences is the largest Harvard faculty and has primary responsibility for instruction in Harvard College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and the Division of Continuing Education, which includes Harvard Summer School and Harvard Extension School. There are nine other graduate and professional faculties as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.\n\n\nJoint programs with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, the Broad Institute, The Observatory of Economic Complexity, and edX.\n\n\n\n### Endowment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard University endowment\n\nHarvard has the largest university endowment in the world, valued at about $50.7 billion as of 2023.[3][4]\nDuring the recession of 2007–2009, it suffered significant losses that forced large budget cuts, in particular temporarily halting construction on the Allston Science Complex.[61]\nThe endowment has since recovered.[62][63][64][65]\n\n\nAbout $2 billion of investment income is annually distributed to fund operations.[66]\nHarvard's ability to fund its degree and financial aid programs depends on the performance of its endowment; a poor performance in fiscal year 2016 forced a 4.4% cut in the number of graduate students funded by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.[67]\nEndowment income is critical, as only 22% of revenue is from students' tuition, fees, room, and board.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Divestment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Financial endowment § Criticism and reforms\n\nSince the 1970s, several student-led campaigns have advocated divesting Harvard's endowment from controversial holdings, including investments in apartheid South Africa, Sudan during the Darfur genocide, and the tobacco, fossil fuel, and private prison industries.[69][70]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, during the divestment from South Africa movement, student activists erected a symbolic \"shantytown\" on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown.[71][72]\nThe university eventually reduced its South African holdings by $230 million (out of $400 million) in response to the pressure.[71][73]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Teaching and learning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Massachusetts Hall (1720), Harvard's oldest building[74]\n![](image)Harvard Yard\nHarvard is a large, highly residential research university[75]\noffering 50 undergraduate majors,[76]\n134 graduate degrees,[77]\nand 32 professional degrees.[78]\nDuring the 2018–2019 academic year, Harvard granted 1,665 baccalaureate degrees, 1,013 graduate degrees, and 5,695 professional degrees.[78]\n\n\nHarvard College, the four-year, full-time undergraduate program, has a liberal arts and sciences focus.[75][76]\nTo graduate in the usual four years, undergraduates normally take four courses per semester.[79]\nIn most majors, an honors degree requires advanced coursework and a senior thesis.[80]\nThough some introductory courses have large enrollments, the median class size is 12 students.[81]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nHarvard is a founding member of the Association of American Universities[82] and a preeminent research university with \"very high\" research activity (R1) and comprehensive doctoral programs across the arts, sciences, engineering, and medicine according to the Carnegie Classification.[75]\n\n\nWith the medical school consistently ranking first among medical schools for research,[83] biomedical research is an area of particular strength for the university. More than 11,000 faculty and over 1,600 graduate students conduct research at the medical school as well as its 15 affiliated hospitals and research institutes.[84] The medical school and its affiliates attracted $1.65 billion in competitive research grants from the National Institutes of Health in 2019, more than twice as much as any other university.[85]\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Widener Library anchors the Harvard Library system.\n![](image)Henry Moore's sculpture *Large Four Piece Reclining Figure*, near Lamont Library\nThe Harvard Library system is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard and comprises nearly 80 individual libraries holding about 20.4 million items.[16][17][19] According to the American Library Association, this makes it the largest academic library in the world.[17][5]\n\n\nHoughton Library, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials. America's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public. The largest collection of East-Asian language material outside of East Asia is held in the Harvard-Yenching Library\n\n\nThe Harvard Art Museums comprise three museums. The Arthur M. Sackler Museum covers Asian, Mediterranean, and Islamic art, the Busch–Reisinger Museum (formerly the Germanic Museum) covers central and northern European art, and the Fogg Museum covers Western art from the Middle Ages to the present emphasizing Italian early Renaissance, British pre-Raphaelite, and 19th-century French art.

Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.[107]\n\n\n\n\n\n| School\n | Founded\n | Enrollment\n | U.S. News & World Report |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Harvard University\n | 1636\n | 31,345[108] | 3[109] |\n| Medicine | 1782\n | 660\n | 1[110] |\n| Divinity | 1816\n | 377\n | N/A\n |\n| Law | 1817\n | 1,990\n | 4[111] |\n| Dental Medicine | 1867\n | 280\n | N/A\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | 1872\n | 4,824\n | N/A\n |\n| Business | 1908\n | 2,011\n | 5[112] |\n| Extension | 1910\n | 3,428\n | N/A\n |\n| Design | 1914\n | 878\n | N/A\n |\n| Education | 1920\n | 876\n | 2[113] |\n| Public Health | 1922\n | 1,412\n | 3[112] |\n| Government | 1936\n | 1,100\n | 6[114] |\n| Engineering | 2007\n | 1,750\n | 21[115] |\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[116] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 36%\n | 36 |\n| Asian | 21%\n | 21 |\n| Hispanic | 12%\n | 12 |\n| Foreign national | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Black | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Other[Notes 2] | 9%\n | 9 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[Notes 3] | 18%\n | 18 |\n| Affluent[Notes 4] | 82%\n | 82 |\n\n\nStudent life and activities are generally organized within each school.\n\n\n\n### Student government[edit]\n\n\nThe Undergraduate Council represents College students. The Graduate Council represents students at all twelve graduate and professional schools, most of which also have their own student government.[117]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard Crimson\n\nBoth the undergraduate College and the graduate schools have intramural sports programs.\n\n\nHarvard College competes in the NCAA Division I Ivy League conference. The school fields 42 intercollegiate sports teams, more than any other college in the country.[118] Every two years, the Harvard and Yale track and field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford and Cambridge team in the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.[119] As with other Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships.[120] The school color is crimson.\n\n\nHarvard's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875.[121]\n\n\n\n## *Harvard University Gazette*[edit]\n\n\nThe *Harvard Gazette*, also called the ***Harvard University Gazette***, is the official press organ of Harvard University. Formerly a print publication, it is now a web site. It publicizes research, faculty, teaching and events at the university. Initiated in 1906, it was originally a weekly calendar of news and events. In 1968 it became a weekly newspaper.\n\n\nWhen the *Gazette* was a print publication, it was considered a good way of keeping up with Harvard news: \"If weekly reading suits you best, the most comprehensive and authoritative medium is the *Harvard University Gazette*\".\n\n\nIn 2010, the *Gazette* \"shifted from a print-first to a digital-first and mobile-first\" publication, and reduced its publication calendar to biweekly, while keeping the same number of reporters, including some who had previously worked for the *Boston Globe*, *Miami Herald*, and the Associated Press.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images**.

Founded in 1701, Yale is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[7]\n\n\nThe **Collegiate School** was established in 1701 by Congregationalist clergy of the Connecticut Colony. At first restricted to instructing ministers in theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution. In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first PhD in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. Yale's faculty and student populations grew rapidly after 1890 with expansion of the physical campus and of scientific research programs.\n\n\nYale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools.[8] While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in West Haven, and forests and nature preserves throughout New England. As of 2021[update], the university's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion, the third largest of any educational institution.[1] The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.[9][10] Student athletes compete in intercollegiate sports as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I Ivy League conference.\n\n\nAs of October 2020[update], 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing Award winners have been affiliated with Yale University. In addition, Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. presidents, 10 Founding Fathers, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 31 living billionaires,[11] 54 college founders and presidents, many heads of state, cabinet members and governors. Hundreds of members of Congress and many U.S. diplomats, 78 MacArthur Fellows, 263 Rhodes Scholars, 123 Marshall Scholars, 81 Gates Cambridge Scholars, 102 Guggenheim Fellows and nine Mitchell Scholars have been affiliated with the university. Yale's current faculty include 67 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[12] 55 members of the National Academy of Medicine,[13] 8 members of the National Academy of Engineering,[14] and 187 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long to read and navigate comfortably**.

The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon after, a group of ten Congregational ministers, Samuel Andrew, Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (nephew of Increase Mather), Rev. James Noyes II (son of James Noyes), James Pierpont, Abraham Pierson, Noadiah Russell, Joseph Webb, and Timothy Woodbridge, all alumni of Harvard, met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell, located in Branford, Connecticut, to donate their books to form the school's library.[16] The group, led by James Pierpont, is now known as \"The Founders\".[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)A front view of Yale-College and the college chapel, printed by Daniel Bowen in 1786\nKnown from its origin as the \"Collegiate School\", the institution opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson, who is today considered the first president of Yale. Pierson lived in Killingworth (now Clinton). The school moved to Saybrook in 1703 when the first treasurer of Yale, Nathaniel Lynde, donated land and a building. In 1716, it moved to New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n\nMeanwhile, there was a rift forming at Harvard between its sixth president, Increase Mather, and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in Church polity. The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.[18] Rev. Jason Haven, the minister at the First Church and Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, had been considered for the presidency on account of his orthodox theology and for \"Neatness dignity and purity of Style [which] surpass those of all that have been mentioned\", but was passed over due to his \"very Valetudinary and infirm State of Health\".[19]\n\n\n\n#### Naming and development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Coat of arms of the family of Elihu Yale, after whom the university was named in 1718\nIn 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted the successful Boston-born businessman Elihu Yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune in Madras while working for the East India Company as the first president of Fort St. George (largely through secret contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under company policy),[20] donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to \"Yale College\".[21] The Welsh name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the Iâl, which the family estate at Plas yn Iâl, near the village of Llandegla, Wales, was called.\n\n\nMeanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.[22] It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the \"new divinity\". In 1722 the rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745, and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Curriculum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753\n![](image)First diploma awarded by Yale College, granted to Nathaniel Chauncey in 1702\nYale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and is organized into a social system of residential colleges.\n\n\nYale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, \"irrelevance\" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and disagreements with the Connecticut legislature.[24][25][*page needed*]\n\n\nSerious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for the study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the college from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. A 1746 graduate of Yale, Stiles came to the college with experience in education, having played an integral role in the founding of Brown University, in addition to having been a minister.[26] Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the college. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, secretary to the British general in command of the occupation, intervened and the college was saved. In 1803, Fanning was granted an honorary degree LL.D. for his efforts.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Students[edit]\n\n\nAs the only college in Connecticut from 1701 to 1823, Yale educated the sons of the elite.[28] Punishable offenses for students included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During this period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side.[29]\n\n\nThe emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: Crotonia in 1738, Linonia in 1753 and Brothers in Unity in 1768. Linonia and Brothers in Unity continue to exist today with commemorations to them can be found with names given to campus structures, like Brothers in Unity Courtyard in Branford College.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old Brick Row in 1807\nThe Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. During this period, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track curriculum. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because it was difficult for an institution to be completely modern or completely classical.[30][31] A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a person possessed of religious values strong enough to sufficiently resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without.[32][*page needed*] William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms of students. Sumner bested President Noah Porter, who disliked the social sciences and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.[33]\n\n\nUntil 1887, the legal name of the university was \"The President and Fellows of Yale College, in New Haven.\" In 1887, under an act passed by the Connecticut General Assembly, Yale was renamed to the present \"Yale University\".[34]\n\n\n\n#### Sports and debate[edit]\n\n\nThe Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the archetype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who \"regretted\" that he \"had but one life to lose\" for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in the combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied this same heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Dink Stover in the novel *Stover at Yale* (1912) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, the alumni, and the team itself.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yale's four-oared crew team posing with the 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy, won in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nAlong with Harvard and Princeton, Yale students rejected British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.[36] The Harvard–Yale football rivalry began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates,[37] and in 1909 (the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There were also rallies to send off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.[38]\n\n\nIn 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06, which sought to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. Presidents Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate reforms to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. While the big three had attempted to operate independently of the majority, the changes pushed did reduce injuries.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Expansion[edit]\n\n\nStarting with the addition of the Yale School of Medicine in 1810, the college expanded gradually from then on, establishing the Yale Divinity School in 1822, Yale Law School in 1822, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1847, the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School in 1847,[a] and the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1869. In 1887, under the presidency of Timothy Dwight V, Yale College was renamed to Yale University, and the former name was subsequently applied only to the undergraduate college. The university would continue to expand greatly into the 20th and 21st century, adding the Yale School of Music in 1894, the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in 1900, the Yale School of Public Health in 1915, the Yale School of Architecture in 1916, the Yale School of Nursing 1923, the Yale School of Drama in 1955, the Yale School of Management in 1976, and the Jackson School of Global Affairs which is planned to open in 2022.[40] The Sheffield Scientific School would also reorganize its relationship with the university to teach only undergraduate courses.\n\n\nExpansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, a moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership.[*citation needed*] Historian George Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.[41][*page needed*] Levesque continues, saying he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. Levesque concludes, noting he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n#### Medicine[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Woolsey Hall c. 1905\nMilton Winternitz led the Yale School of Medicine as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about \"social medicine\" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the \"Yale System\" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the psychiatry department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful antisemitic colleagues drove him to resign.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor of the Yale campus facing northBefore World War II, most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.[43] Almost all members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and some members of other faculties—teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually.[44]\n\n\n#### Women[edit]\n\n\nIn 1793, Lucinda Foote passed the entrance exams for Yale College, but was rejected by the president on the basis of her gender.[45] Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[46] The first seven women to earn PhDs at Yale received their degrees in 1894: Elizabeth Deering Hanscom, Cornelia H. B. Rogers, Sara Bulkley Rogers, Margaretta Palmer, Mary Augusta Scott, Laura Johnson Wylie, and Charlotte Fitch Roberts. There is a portrait of these seven women in Sterling Memorial Library, painted by Brenda Zlamany.[47]\n\n\nIn 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female and part of the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.[48] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;[49] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[50] at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus.[51]\n\n\nA decade into co-education, student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued Yale for its failure to curtail campus sexual harassment, especially by male faculty. The case was partly built from a 1977 report authored by plaintiff Ann Olivarius, now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual harassment, \"A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus.\"[52] This case was the first to use Title IX to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be considered illegal sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in the case were Olivarius, Ronni Alexander (now a professor at Kobe University, Japan), Margery Reifler (works in the Los Angeles film industry), Pamela Price[53] (district attorney in Alameda County, California), and Lisa E. Stone (works at Anti-Defamation League). They were joined by Yale classics professor John \"Jack\" J. Winkler, who died in 1990. The lawsuit, brought partly by Catharine MacKinnon, alleged rape, fondling, and offers of higher grades for sex by several Yale faculty, including Keith Brion, professor of flute and director of bands, Political Science professor Raymond Duvall[54] (now at the University of Minnesota), English professor Michael Cooke, and the coach of the field hockey team, Richard Kentwell. While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale's Grievance Board and the Yale Women's Center.[55] In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates, including editors of Yale's feminist magazine *Broad Recognition*, alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate.[56] In response, the university formed a Title IX steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct.[57] Afterwards, universities and colleges throughout the US also established sexual harassment grievance procedures.\n\n\n\n#### Class[edit]\n\n\nYale instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to maintain the proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see *numerus clausus*) and eliminated such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.[58]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Yale and Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students.[59] In July 2012, the Yale University-PKU Program ended due to weak participation.[59]\n\n\nIn 2007 outgoing Yale President Rick Levin characterized Yale's institutional priorities: \"First, among the nation's finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders.\"[60]\n\n\nIn 2009, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair picked Yale as one location – the others being Britain's Durham University and Universiti Teknologi Mara – for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's United States Faith and Globalization Initiative.[61] As of 2009, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, \"Debating Globalization\".[62] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair Howard Dean teaches a residential college seminar, \"Understanding Politics and Politicians\".[63] Also in 2009, an alliance was formed among Yale, University College London, and both schools' affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care—a growing field known as translational medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but \"no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL\".[64]\n\n\nIn August 2013, a new partnership with the National University of Singapore led to the opening of Yale-NUS College in Singapore, a joint effort to create a new liberal arts college in Asia featuring a curriculum including both Western and Asian traditions.[65]\n\n\nIn 2017, having been suggested for decades,[66] Yale University renamed Calhoun College, named for slave owner, anti-abolitionist, and white supremacist Vice President John C. Calhoun (it is now Hopper College, after Grace Hopper).[67][68]\n\n\nIn 2020, in the wake of protests around the world focused on racial relations and criminal justice reform, the #CancelYale tag was used on social media to demand that Elihu Yale's name be removed from Yale University. Most support for the change stemmed from politically conservative pundits, such as Mike Cernovich and Ann Coulter, satirizing perceived excesses of online cancel culture.[69] Yale was president of Fort. St George in Madras, a fort of the East India Company in India, which was one of the biggest corporation in the world at the time. The company traded textiles, goods, diamonds, cotton, spices, among others, and was involved in the slave trade in India, with a private army of 260,000 soldiers, twice the size of Britain.[70]\nHis singularly large donation of paintings and books to the college led some critics to argue that Yale relied on money related to the slave-trade for its first scholarships and endowments.[71][72][73][74]\n\n\nIn August 2020, the US Justice Department sued Yale for alleged discrimination against Asian and white candidates on the basis of their race through affirmative action admission policies.[75] In early February 2021, under the new Biden administration, the Justice Department withdrew the lawsuit. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, later won a similar lawsuit against Harvard alleging the same issue.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Yale alumni in politics[edit]\n\n\nThe *Boston Globe* wrote that \"if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national leaders over the past three decades, it's Yale\".[77][*verification needed*] Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. presidential election between 1972 and 2004.[78] Yale-educated presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, and major-party nominees during this period include Hillary Clinton (2016), John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (vice president, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (vice president, 1972). Other Yale alumni who have made serious bids for the presidency during this period include Amy Klobuchar (2020), Tom Steyer (2020), Ben Carson (2016), Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), Paul Tsongas (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992).\n\n\nSeveral explanations have been offered for Yale's representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates.[79][*verification needed*] Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating \"a laboratory for future leaders\", an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster.[79] Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: \"We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.\"[77] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes \"an ethos of organized activity\" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the *Yale Daily News*.[80] Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: \"It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.\"[81] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the \"son and grandson of alumni\", and for a \"member of a politically influential family\".[82] *New York Times* correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and *The Atlantic Monthly* correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.[83]\n\n\nDuring the 1988 presidential election, George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis for having \"foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique\". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis' Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was \"so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it\" and said Yale did not share Harvard's reputation for \"liberalism and elitism\".[84] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, \"In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation\".[83]\n\n\n\n## Administration and organization[edit]\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| School founding\n |\n| --- |\n| **School** | **Year founded** |\n| Yale College | 1701\n |\n| Yale School of Medicine | 1810\n |\n| Yale Divinity School | 1822\n |\n| Yale Law School | 1824\n |\n| Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1847\n |\n| Sheffield Scientific School[a] | 1847\n |\n| Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science | 1852\n |\n| Yale School of Fine Arts | 1869\n |\n| Yale School of Music | 1894\n |\n| Yale School of the Environment | 1900\n |\n| Yale School of Public Health | 1915\n |\n| Yale School of Architecture | 1916\n |\n| Yale School of Nursing | 1923\n |\n| David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University | 1955\n |\n| Yale School of Management | 1976\n |\n| Jackson School of Global Affairs | 2022[40] |\n\n\nThe President and Fellows of Yale College, also known as the Yale Corporation, or board of trustees, is the governing body of the university and consists of thirteen standing committees with separate responsibilities outlined in the by-laws. The corporation has 19 members: three ex officio members, ten successor trustees, and six elected alumni fellows.[85] The university has three major academic components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the twelve professional schools.[86]\n\n\nYale's former president Richard C. Levin was, at the time, one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million.[87] Yale's succeeding president Peter Salovey ranks 40th with a 2020 salary of $1.16 million.[88]\n\n\nThe Yale Provost's Office and similar executive positions have launched several women into prominent university executive positions. In 1977, Provost Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed interim president of Yale and later went on to become president of the University of Chicago, being the first woman to hold either position at each respective school.[89][90] In 1994, Provost Judith Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania.[91] In 2002, Provost Alison Richard became the vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge.[92] In 2003, the dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp, was appointed president of Colgate University and later went on to serve as the president of the Swarthmore College in 2009, and then the first female chancellor of the University of Denver in 2014.[93] In 2004, Provost Dr. Susan Hockfield became the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[94] In 2004, Dean of the Nursing school, Catherine Gilliss, was appointed the dean of Duke University's School of Nursing and vice chancellor for nursing affairs.[95] In 2007, Deputy Provost H. Kim Bottomly was named president of Wellesley College.[96]\n\n\nSimilar examples for men who have served in Yale leadership positions can also be found. In 2004, Dean of Yale College Richard H. Brodhead was appointed as the president of Duke University.[97] In 2008, Provost Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the vice chancellor of the University of Oxford.[98]\n\n\n\n### Staff and labor unions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Federation of Hospital and University Employees\n\nYale University staff are represented by several different unions. Clerical and technical workers are represented by Local 34, and service and maintenance workers are represented by Local 35, both of the same union affiliate UNITE HERE.[99] Unlike similar institutions, Yale has consistently refused to recognize its graduate student union, Local 33 (another affiliate of UNITE HERE), citing claims that the union's elections were undemocratic and how graduate students are not employees;[100][101] the move to not recognize the union has been criticized by the American Federation of Teachers.[102] In addition, officers of the Yale University Police Department are represented by the Yale Police Benevolent Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Employees.[99][103] Yale security officers joined the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America in late 2010,[104] even though the Yale administration contested the election.[105] In October 2014, after deliberation,[106] Yale security decided to form a new union, the Yale University Security Officers Association, which has since represented the campus security officers.[99][107]\n\n\nYale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes.[108][*page needed*] There have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and *The New York Times* wrote that Yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S.[109] Moreover, Yale has been accused by the AFL–CIO of failing to treat workers with respect,[110] as well as not renewing contracts with professors over involvement in campus labor issues.[111] Yale has responded to strikes with claims over mediocre union participation and the benefits of their contracts.[112]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale Law School, located in the Sterling Law Building ![](image)Interior of Beinecke Library\nYale's central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres (1.1 km2) and comprises its main, historic campus and a medical campus adjacent to the Yale–New Haven Hospital. In western New Haven, the university holds 500 acres (2.0 km2) of athletic facilities, including the Yale Golf Course.[113] In 2008, Yale purchased the 17-building, 136-acre (0.55 km2) former Bayer HealthCare complex in West Haven, Connecticut,[114] the buildings of which are now used as laboratory and research space.[115] Yale also owns seven forests in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire—the largest of which is the 7,840-acre (31.7 km2) Yale-Myers Forest in Connecticut's Quiet Corner—and nature preserves including Horse Island.[116]\n\n\nYale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus[117] as well as several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn's Yale Art Gallery[118] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen's Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph's Art & Architecture Building. Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue, which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s.[119] In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the Yale campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States.[120]\n\n\nMany of Yale's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness, including the Yale Drama School.[121][122] Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities, such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes, like a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid,[123] deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon.\n\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Nathan Hale in front of Connecticut Hall\n![](image)Vanderbilt Hall\nOther examples of the Gothic style are on the Old Campus by architects like Henry Austin, Charles C. Haight and Russell Sturgis. Several are associated with members of the Vanderbilt family, including Vanderbilt Hall,[124] Phelps Hall,[125] St. Anthony Hall (a commission for member Frederick William Vanderbilt), the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (the engineering and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of Silliman College, the largest residential college.[126]\n\n\nThe oldest building on campus, Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the Georgian style. Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College, Pierson College, and Davenport College, except the latter's east, York Street façade, which was constructed in the Gothic style to coordinate with adjacent structures.\n\n\nThe Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. The library includes a six-story above-ground tower of book stacks, filled with 180,000 volumes, that is surrounded by large translucent Vermont marble panels and a steel and granite truss. The panels act as windows and subdue direct sunlight while also diffusing the light in warm hues throughout the interior.[127] Near the library is a sunken courtyard with sculptures by Isamu Noguchi that are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube).[128] The library is located near the center of the university in Hewitt Quadrangle, which is now more commonly referred to as \"Beinecke Plaza\".\n\n\nAlumnus Eero Saarinen, Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Washington Dulles International Airport main terminal, Bell Labs Holmdel Complex and the CBS Building in Manhattan, designed Ingalls Rink, dedicated in 1959,[129] as well as the residential colleges Ezra Stiles and Morse.[130] These latter were modeled after the medieval Italian hill town of San Gimignano – a prototype chosen for the town's pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers.[131] These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college's many Gothic spires and Georgian cupolas.[132]\n\n\nThe athletic field complex is partially in New Haven, and partially in West Haven.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nYale's Old Campus at dusk, April 2013\n\n### Notable nonresidential campus buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Harkness Tower\nNotable nonresidential campus buildings and landmarks include Battell Chapel, Beinecke Rare Book Library, Harkness Tower, Humanities Quadrangle, Ingalls Rink, Kline Biology Tower, Osborne Memorial Laboratories, Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Sterling Hall of Medicine, Sterling Law Buildings, Sterling Memorial Library, Woolsey Hall, Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Art Gallery, Yale Art & Architecture Building, and the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in London.\n\n\nYale's secret society buildings (some of which are called \"tombs\") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. A diversity of architectural styles is represented: Berzelius, Donn Barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); Book and Snake, Louis R. Metcalfe in a Greek Ionic style (erected in 1901); Elihu, architect unknown but built in a Colonial style (constructed on an early 17th-century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); Mace and Chain, in a late colonial, early Victorian style (built in 1823). (Interior moulding is said to have belonged to Benedict Arnold);Manuscript Society, King-lui Wu with Dan Kiley responsible for landscaping and Josef Albers for the brickwork intaglio mural. Building constructed in a mid-century modern style; Scroll and Key, Richard Morris Hunt in a Moorish- or Islamic-inspired Beaux-Arts style (erected 1869–70); Skull and Bones, possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin in an Egypto-Doric style utilizing Brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the Neo-Gothic towers in rear garden were completed); St. Elmo, (former tomb) Kenneth M. Murchison, 1912, designs inspired by Elizabethan manor. Current location, brick colonial; and Wolf's Head, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, erected 1923–1924, Collegiate Gothic.\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nYale's Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale.[134] Yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by 2020. As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges.[135] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification.[136] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls.[137] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a \"B+\" grade overall.[138] Yale is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[139]\n\n\n\n* Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven\n* Marsh Botanical Garden\n* Yale Sustainable Food Program Farm\n\n\n### Relationship with New Haven[edit]\n\n\nYale is the largest taxpayer and employer in the City of New Haven,[140] and has often buoyed the city's economy and communities. Yale, however, has consistently opposed paying a tax on its academic property.[141] Yale's Art Galleries, along with many other university resources, are free and openly accessible. Yale also funds the New Haven Promise program, paying full tuition for eligible students from New Haven public schools.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Town–gown relations[edit]\n\n\nYale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in myriad community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Campus safety[edit]\n\n\nSeveral campus safety strategies have been pioneered at Yale. The first campus police force was founded at Yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus.[144][145] Later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior.[146][147] In addition to the Yale Police Department, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a safety escort, and 24-hour shuttle service.\n\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale's student and faculty recruiting efforts.[148] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven's crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the New Haven Police and Yale's campus became the safest among peer schools.[149]\n\n\nIn 2004, the national non-profit watchdog group Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults.[150][151]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Yale announced that it will require students to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of being on campus during the fall 2021 term.[152]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admission to Yale College is considered \"most selective\" by *U.S. News*.[153][154] In 2022, Yale accepted 2,234 students to the Class of 2026 out of 50,015 applicants, for an acceptance rate of 4.46%.[155] 98% of students graduate within six years.[156]\n\n\nThrough its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants, and the university is need-blind for both domestic and international applicants.[157] Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2017 was $46,395.[158] 15% of Yale College students are expected to have no parental contribution, and about 50% receive some form of financial aid.[156][159][160] About 16% of the Class of 2013 had some form of student loan debt at graduation, with an average debt of $13,000 among borrowers.[156] For 2019, Yale ranked second in enrollment of recipients of the National Merit $2,500 Scholarship (140 scholars).[161]\n\n\nHalf of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 39% are ethnic minority U.S. citizens (19% are underrepresented minorities), and 10.5% are international students.[158] 55% attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools, and 97% of students were in the top 10% of their high school class.[156] Every year, Yale College also admits a small group of non-traditional students through the Eli Whitney Students Program.\n\n\n\n### Collections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University's Sterling Memorial Library, as seen from Maya Lin's sculpture, *Women's Table*. The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969.\nYale University Library, which holds over 15 million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in the United States.[9][162] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject and location libraries.\n\n\nRare books are found in several Yale collections. The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary works. The Elizabethan Club, technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale.\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Night Café*, Vincent van Gogh, 1888, Yale Art Gallery\nYale's museum collections are also of international stature. The Yale University Art Gallery, the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartwout and Kahn buildings. The latter, Louis Kahn's first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The Yale Center for British Art, the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building.\n\n\nThe Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments, affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted.\n\n\nThe museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his Yale-financed expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 – when the removal of such artifacts was legal. The artifacts were restored to Peru in 2012.[163]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[164] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[165] | 3 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[166] | 7 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[167] | 4 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[168] | 11 |\n| *QS*[169] | 16 |\n| *THE*[170] | 9 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[171] | 11 |\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR graduate school rankings[172]\n |\n| --- |\n| Business\n | 7\n |\n| Engineering\n | 38\n |\n| Law\n | 1\n |\n| Medicine: Primary Care\n | 59\n |\n| Medicine: Research\n | 10\n |\n| Nursing: doctorate\n | 21\n |\n| Nursing: Master's\n | 20\n |\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR departmental rankings[172]\n |\n| --- |\n| Biological Sciences\n | 6\n |\n| Chemistry\n | 12\n |\n| Clinical Psychology\n | 18\n |\n| Computer Science\n | 20\n |\n| Earth Sciences\n | 19\n |\n| Economics\n | 4\n |\n| English\n | 1\n |\n| Fine Arts\n | 2\n |\n| History\n | 2\n |\n| Mathematics\n | 12\n |\n| Nursing–Midwifery\n | 2\n |\n| Physician Assistant\n | 26\n |\n| Physics\n | 11\n |\n| Political Science\n | 6\n |\n| Psychology\n | 6\n |\n| Public Health\n | 11\n |\n| Sociology\n | 18\n |\n| Statistics\n | 13\n |\n\n\nThe *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Yale third among U.S. national universities for 2016,[153] as it had for each of the previous sixteen years. Yale University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[173]\n\n\nInternationally, Yale was ranked 11th in the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities, tenth in the 2016–17 Nature Index[174] for quality of scientific research output, and tenth in the 2016 CWUR World University Rankings.[175] The university was also ranked sixth in the 2016 Times Higher Education (THE) Global University Employability Rankings[176] and eighth in the Academic World Reputation Rankings.[177] In 2019, it ranked 27th among the universities around the world by *SCImago Institutions Rankings*.[178]\n\n\n\n### Faculty, research, and intellectual traditions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *(March 2021)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nYale is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[179] According to the National Science Foundation, Yale spent $990 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 15th in the nation.[180]\n\n\nYale's current faculty include 67 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[12] 55 members of the National Academy of Medicine,[13] 8 members of the National Academy of Engineering,[14] and 187 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[15] The college is, after normalization for institution size, the tenth-largest baccalaureate source of doctoral degree recipients in the United States, and the largest such source within the Ivy League.[181] It also is a top 10 (ranked seventh) baccalaureate source (after normalization for the number of graduates) of some of the most notable scientists (Nobel, Fields, Turing prizes, or membership in National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, or National Academy of Medicine).[182]\n\n\nYale's English and Comparative Literature departments were part of the New Criticism movement. Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren, W.K. Wimsatt, and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction. Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, taught at the department of comparative literature from the late 1970s to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called \"Yale School\". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C. Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th century. The *Journal of Music Theory* was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars.\n\n\nSince the late 1960s, Yale produces social sciences and policy research through its Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS).\n\n\nIn addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 Postdocs from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the Yale Postdoctoral Association.\n\n\n\n## Campus life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[183] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 35%\n | 35 |\n| Asian | 24%\n | 24 |\n| Hispanic | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Foreign national | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 9%\n | 9 |\n| Other[b] | 6%\n | 6 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[c] | 20%\n | 20 |\n| Affluent[d] | 80%\n | 80 |\n\n\nYale is a research university, with the majority of its students in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates, or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.[184] The median family income of Yale students is $192,600, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 16% from the bottom 60%.[185]\n\n\n\n### Residential colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Residential colleges of Yale University\n\nYale's residential college system was established in 1933 by Edward S. Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \"Master's Teas\", but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college.\n\n\nAll undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.[186] While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the Old Campus, the university's oldest precinct.\n\n\nWhile Harkness' original colleges were Georgian Revival or Collegiate Gothic in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history. In 2017, the university opened two new colleges near Science Hill.[187]\n  \n\n\n\n\n* ![Jonathan Edwards College courtyard](image)\n\nJonathan Edwards College courtyard\n* ![Branford College courtyard](image)\n\nBranford College courtyard\n* ![Saybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard](image)\n\nSaybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard\n* ![Hopper College courtyard](image)\n\nHopper College courtyard\n* ![Berkeley College buildings](image)\n\nBerkeley College buildings\n* ![Trumbull College courtyard](image)\n\nTrumbull College courtyard\n* ![Davenport College courtyard](image)\n\nDavenport College courtyard\n* ![Pierson College courtyard](image)\n\nPierson College courtyard\n* ![Silliman College courtyard](image)\n\nSilliman College courtyard\n* ![Timothy Dwight College courtyard](image)\n\nTimothy Dwight College courtyard\n* ![Morse College courtyard](image)\n\nMorse College courtyard\n* ![Ezra Stiles College courtyard](image)\n\nEzra Stiles College courtyard\n* ![Benjamin Franklin College courtyard](image)\n\nBenjamin Franklin College courtyard\n* ![Pauli Murray College courtyard](image)\n\nPauli Murray College courtyard\n\n\n#### Calhoun College[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1960s, John C. Calhoun's white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership[188][189][190][191] had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. The racially motivated church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change.[189] They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an \"extraordinary American statesman\"—he was \"one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy\" in the history of the United States.[189][190] In August 2015, Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed.[191] He described Calhoun as \"a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina\".[191] He acknowledged that Calhoun also \"believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests.\"[188] Student activism about this issue increased in the fall of 2015, and included further protests sparked by controversy surrounding an administrator's comments on the potential positive and negative implications of students who wear Halloween costumes that are culturally sensitive.[192] Campus-wide discussions expanded to include critical discussion of the experiences of women of color on campus, and the realities of racism in undergraduate life.[193] The protests were sensationalized by the media and led to the labelling of some students as being members of Generation Snowflake.[194]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Salovey announced that \"despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests\", Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college[195] explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's \"shadow\" so they will be \"better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future\". He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would \"obscure\" his \"legacy of slavery rather than addressing it\".[195] \"Yale is part of that history\" and \"We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it.\" One change that will be issued is the title of \"master\" for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to \"head of college\" due to its connotation of slavery.[196]\n\n\nDespite this apparently conclusive reasoning, Salovey announced that Calhoun College would be renamed for groundbreaking computer scientist Grace Hopper in February 2017.[197] This renaming decision received a range of responses from Yale students and alumni.[198][199][200] In his 2019 book *Assault on American Excellence*, former Dean of Yale Law School Anthony T. Kronman criticized the title and name changes and the lack of support from Salovey for the Christakises, who were targeted by the student activists. Other members of the university community disagreed with Kronman's positions.[201]\n\n\n\n### Student organizations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the process of registration.[202]\n\n\nThe university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. The Yale Literary Magazine, founded in February 1836, is the oldest student literary magazine in the United States.[203] Established in 1872, *The Yale Record* is the world's oldest humor magazine. Newspapers include the *Yale Daily News*, which was first published in 1878, and the weekly *Yale Herald*, which was first published in 1986. The *Yale Journal of Medicine & Law* is a biannual magazine that explores the intersection of law and medicine.\n\n\nDwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition[204] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio[205] is the campus's radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM and FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream.\n\n\nThe Yale College Council (YCC) serves as the campus's undergraduate student government. All registered student organizations are regulated and funded by a subsidiary organization of the YCC, known as the Undergraduate Organizations Funding Committee (UOFC).[206] The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) serves as Yale's graduate and professional student government.\n\n\nThe Yale Political Union (YPU) is a debate society founded in 1934 to host student discussions on a wide variety of topics. It is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry and George Pataki.\n\n\nThe Yale International Relations Association (YIRA) functions as the umbrella organization for the university's top-ranked Model UN team. YIRA also has a Europe-based offshoot, Yale Model Government Europe, other Model UN conferences such as YMUN, YMUN Korea, YMUN Taiwan and Yale Model African Union (YMAU), and educational programs such as the Yale Review of International Studies (YRIS), Yale International Relations Leadership Institute, and Hemispheres.\n\n\nThe campus includes several fraternities and sororities. The campus features at least 18 a cappella groups, the most famous of which is The Whiffenpoofs, which from its founding in 1909 until 2018 was made up solely of senior men.\n\n\nThe Elizabethan Club, a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the \"Lizzie's\" premises for conversation and tea. The club owns first editions of a Shakespeare Folio, several Shakespeare Quartos, and a first edition of Milton's *Paradise Lost*, among other important literary texts.\n\n\n\n#### Secret societies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yale secret societies\n\nYale's secret societies include Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Wolf's Head, Book and Snake, Elihu, Berzelius, St. Elmo, Manuscript, Brothers in Unity, Linonia, St. Anthony Hall, Shabtai, Myth and Sword, Daughters of Sovereign Government (DSG), Mace and Chain, ISO, Spade and Grave, and Sage and Chalice, among others. The two oldest existing honor societies are the Aurelian (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916).[207]\n\n\nThese are akin to Harvard finals clubs, Princeton eating clubs, and senior societies at University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bladderball\n\nYale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their \"bright college years\", though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with \"bubble pipes\".[208][209] (\"Bright College Years\", the university's alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand, Class of 1881, to the tune of *Die Wacht am Rhein*.) Yale's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus; however, actual students rarely do so.[210] In the second half of the 20th century Bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014.[211][212][213]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yale Bulldogs\n\n![](image)The Yale Bowl, the college football stadium\nYale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships.\n\n\nYale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation's first natural \"bowl\" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world.[214]\n\n\nIn 1970 the NCAA banned Yale from participating in all NCAA sports for two years, in reaction to Yale – against the wishes of the NCAA – playing its Jewish center Jack Langer in college games after Langer had played for Team United States at the 1969 Maccabiah Games in Israel with the approval of Yale President Kingman Brewster.[215][216][217][218] The decision impacted 300 Yale students, every Yale student on its sports teams, over the next two years.[219]\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the men's basketball team won the Ivy League Championship title for the first time in 54 years, earning a spot in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. In the first round of the tournament, the Bulldogs beat the Baylor Bears 79–75 in the school's first-ever tournament win.[220]\n\n![](image)The Walter Camp Gate at the Yale Athletic Complex\nIn May 2018, the men's lacrosse team defeated the Duke Blue Devils to claim their first-ever NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship,[221] and were the first Ivy League school to win the title since the Princeton Tigers in 2001.[222]\n\n\nYale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won Olympic Games Gold Medal for men's eights in 1924 and 1956. The Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale's fourth new boathouse in 157 years of collegiate rowing. The Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder '79 and her father Richard Gilder '54, who gave $4 million towards the $7.5 million project. Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men's team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race.\n\n\nIn 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game.[223]\n\n\nYale students claim to have invented Frisbee, by tossing empty Frisbie Pie Company tins.[224][225]\n\n\nYale athletics are supported by the Yale Precision Marching Band. \"Precision\" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching.[226] The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter.\n\n\nYale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about 10 different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup.\n\n\n\n#### Song[edit]\n\n\nNotable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement, convocation, alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, \"Bright College Years\". Despite its popularity, \"Boola Boola\" is not the official fight song, albeit being the origin of the university's unofficial motto. The official Yale fight song, \"Bulldog\" was written by Cole Porter during his undergraduate days and is sung after touchdowns during a football game.[227] Additionally, two other songs, \"Down the Field\" by C.W. O'Conner, and \"Bingo Eli Yale\", also by Cole Porter, are still sung at football games. According to *College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology* published in 1998, \"Down the Field\" ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time.[228]\n\n\n\n#### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe school mascot is \"Handsome Dan\", the Yale bulldog, and the Yale fight song contains the refrain, \"Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow.\" The school color, since 1894, is Yale Blue.[229] Yale's Handsome Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889.[230]\n\n\n\n### Mental health[edit]\n\n\nYale has faced significant criticism for its handling of student mental health on campus.[231][232][233][234] Suicidal and depressed students say that Yale forced them to medically withdraw rather than provide them with academic accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and in 2018 the Ruderman Family Foundation ranked Yale as having the worst mental health policies in the Ivy League.[235][236][233]\n\n\n\n> \n> Dear Yale, I loved being here. I only wish I could've had some time. I needed time to work things out and to wait for new medication to kick in, but I couldn't do it in school, and I couldn't bear the thought of having to leave for a full year, or of leaving and never being readmitted. Love, Luchang.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nLuchang Wang, posted on Facebook in 2015 shortly before her death[231][234][237][238][239]\n\nStudents at Yale say that the university's policies force them to hide their depression and avoid seeking help, for fear of being forced to leave.[231][235][234] One prominent case was the suicide of Luchang Wang in 2015, who died by suicide after making a Facebook post saying that she needed time to deal with her mental health issues, but could not deal with being forced to medically withdraw for an entire year with an uncertain chance of being readmitted.[237][234][239] Wang had previously withdrawn from school due to mental health issues, and was afraid of being forced to withdraw again, as a second readmission attempt would be considerably more difficult for her.[237][234] A friend of Wang said that she routinely lied to her university therapist to avoid being kicked out,[237] and another student said that many at Yale lie to their counselors as \"there's no clear standard established that says exactly what students will get involuntarily hospitalized or withdrawn for\".[234] In response, the university convened a commission to evaluate their readmission policies after a mental health withdrawal, renaming the process to \"reinstatement\" as well as eliminating the $50 reapplication fee.[231]\n\n\nFor students that do seek help, waitlists for therapy can be months long, with individual counselling sessions only 30 minutes in length.[231] In 2022, after a Washington Post article about their medical withdrawal policies, the school increased the number of mental health clinicians on campus from 51 to 60 as well as promised further changes.[232] In 2023, after a lawsuit was filed against the school for what the plaintiffs described as discrimination, the university changed the name of a \"medical withdrawal\" to a \"medical leave of absence\" saying that the \"leave of absence\" terminology would allow students to remain on Yale's insurance while away from the school.[240] The new policy also allowed for students on a leave of absence to participate in extracurricular clubs and visit campus,[240] something a student on medical withdrawal was banned from doing.[231] A representative of Yale also said that the criticism of their policies \"misrepresents our efforts and unwavering commitment to supporting our students, whose well-being and success are our primary focus\" and that \"the mental health of our students is a very, very high priority\".[232]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Benefactors[edit]\n\n\nYale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: Elihu Yale, Jeremiah Dummer, the Vanderbilt family, the Harkness family (Edward, Anna, and William), the Beinecke family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter), John William Sterling, Payne Whitney, Joseph Earl Sheffield, Paul Mellon, Charles B. G. Murphy, Joseph Tsai, William K. Lanman, and Stephen Schwarzman. The Yale Class of 1954, led by Richard Gilder, donated $70 million in commemoration of their 50th reunion.[241] Charles B. Johnson, a 1954 graduate of Yale College, pledged a $250 million gift in 2013 to support the construction of two new residential colleges.[242] The colleges have been named respectively in honor of Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin. A $100 million contribution[243] by Stephen Adams enabled the Yale School of Music to become tuition-free and the Adams Center for Musical Arts to be built, while a $150 million contribution[244] by David Geffen enabled the Yale School of Drama (renamed the David Geffen School of Drama at Yale) to become tuition-free as well.\n\n\n\n### Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Yale University people, List of Yale Law School alumni, and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Yale University\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long to read and navigate comfortably**.

For example, Owen Johnson's novel *Stover at Yale* follows the college career of Dink Stover,[379] and Frank Merriwell, the model for all later juvenile sports fiction, plays football, baseball, crew, and track at Yale while solving mysteries and righting wrongs.[380][381] Yale University also is mentioned in F.

Founded in 1701, Yale is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[7]\n\n\nThe **Collegiate School** was established in 1701 by Congregationalist clergy of the Connecticut Colony. At first restricted to instructing ministers in theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution. In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first PhD in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. Yale's faculty and student populations grew rapidly after 1890 with expansion of the physical campus and of scientific research programs.\n\n\nYale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools.[8] While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in West Haven, and forests and nature preserves throughout New England. As of 2021[update], the university's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion, the third largest of any educational institution.[1] The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.[9][10] Student athletes compete in intercollegiate sports as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I Ivy League conference.\n\n\nAs of October 2020[update], 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing Award winners have been affiliated with Yale University. In addition, Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. presidents, 10 Founding Fathers, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 31 living billionaires,[11] 54 college founders and presidents, many heads of state, cabinet members and governors. Hundreds of members of Congress and many U.S. diplomats, 78 MacArthur Fellows, 263 Rhodes Scholars, 123 Marshall Scholars, 81 Gates Cambridge Scholars, 102 Guggenheim Fellows and nine Mitchell Scholars have been affiliated with the university. Yale's current faculty include 67 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[12] 55 members of the National Academy of Medicine,[13] 8 members of the National Academy of Engineering,[14] and 187 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long to read and navigate comfortably**.

The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon after, a group of ten Congregational ministers, Samuel Andrew, Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (nephew of Increase Mather), Rev. James Noyes II (son of James Noyes), James Pierpont, Abraham Pierson, Noadiah Russell, Joseph Webb, and Timothy Woodbridge, all alumni of Harvard, met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell, located in Branford, Connecticut, to donate their books to form the school's library.[16] The group, led by James Pierpont, is now known as \"The Founders\".[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)A front view of Yale-College and the college chapel, printed by Daniel Bowen in 1786\nKnown from its origin as the \"Collegiate School\", the institution opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson, who is today considered the first president of Yale. Pierson lived in Killingworth (now Clinton). The school moved to Saybrook in 1703 when the first treasurer of Yale, Nathaniel Lynde, donated land and a building. In 1716, it moved to New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n\nMeanwhile, there was a rift forming at Harvard between its sixth president, Increase Mather, and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in Church polity. The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.[18] Rev. Jason Haven, the minister at the First Church and Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, had been considered for the presidency on account of his orthodox theology and for \"Neatness dignity and purity of Style [which] surpass those of all that have been mentioned\", but was passed over due to his \"very Valetudinary and infirm State of Health\".[19]\n\n\n\n#### Naming and development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Coat of arms of the family of Elihu Yale, after whom the university was named in 1718\nIn 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted the successful Boston-born businessman Elihu Yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune in Madras while working for the East India Company as the first president of Fort St. George (largely through secret contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under company policy),[20] donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to \"Yale College\".[21] The Welsh name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the Iâl, which the family estate at Plas yn Iâl, near the village of Llandegla, Wales, was called.\n\n\nMeanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.[22] It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the \"new divinity\". In 1722 the rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745, and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Curriculum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753\n![](image)First diploma awarded by Yale College, granted to Nathaniel Chauncey in 1702\nYale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and is organized into a social system of residential colleges.\n\n\nYale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, \"irrelevance\" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and disagreements with the Connecticut legislature.[24][25][*page needed*]\n\n\nSerious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for the study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the college from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. A 1746 graduate of Yale, Stiles came to the college with experience in education, having played an integral role in the founding of Brown University, in addition to having been a minister.[26] Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the college. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, secretary to the British general in command of the occupation, intervened and the college was saved. In 1803, Fanning was granted an honorary degree LL.D. for his efforts.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Students[edit]\n\n\nAs the only college in Connecticut from 1701 to 1823, Yale educated the sons of the elite.[28] Punishable offenses for students included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During this period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side.[29]\n\n\nThe emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: Crotonia in 1738, Linonia in 1753 and Brothers in Unity in 1768. Linonia and Brothers in Unity continue to exist today with commemorations to them can be found with names given to campus structures, like Brothers in Unity Courtyard in Branford College.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old Brick Row in 1807\nThe Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. During this period, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track curriculum. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because it was difficult for an institution to be completely modern or completely classical.[30][31] A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a person possessed of religious values strong enough to sufficiently resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without.[32][*page needed*] William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms of students. Sumner bested President Noah Porter, who disliked the social sciences and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.[33]\n\n\nUntil 1887, the legal name of the university was \"The President and Fellows of Yale College, in New Haven.\" In 1887, under an act passed by the Connecticut General Assembly, Yale was renamed to the present \"Yale University\".[34]\n\n\n\n#### Sports and debate[edit]\n\n\nThe Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the archetype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who \"regretted\" that he \"had but one life to lose\" for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in the combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied this same heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Dink Stover in the novel *Stover at Yale* (1912) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, the alumni, and the team itself.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yale's four-oared crew team posing with the 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy, won in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nAlong with Harvard and Princeton, Yale students rejected British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.[36] The Harvard–Yale football rivalry began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates,[37] and in 1909 (the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There were also rallies to send off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.[38]\n\n\nIn 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06, which sought to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. Presidents Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate reforms to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. While the big three had attempted to operate independently of the majority, the changes pushed did reduce injuries.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Expansion[edit]\n\n\nStarting with the addition of the Yale School of Medicine in 1810, the college expanded gradually from then on, establishing the Yale Divinity School in 1822, Yale Law School in 1822, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1847, the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School in 1847,[a] and the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1869. In 1887, under the presidency of Timothy Dwight V, Yale College was renamed to Yale University, and the former name was subsequently applied only to the undergraduate college. The university would continue to expand greatly into the 20th and 21st century, adding the Yale School of Music in 1894, the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in 1900, the Yale School of Public Health in 1915, the Yale School of Architecture in 1916, the Yale School of Nursing 1923, the Yale School of Drama in 1955, the Yale School of Management in 1976, and the Jackson School of Global Affairs which is planned to open in 2022.[40] The Sheffield Scientific School would also reorganize its relationship with the university to teach only undergraduate courses.\n\n\nExpansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, a moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership.[*citation needed*] Historian George Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.[41][*page needed*] Levesque continues, saying he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. Levesque concludes, noting he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n#### Medicine[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Woolsey Hall c. 1905\nMilton Winternitz led the Yale School of Medicine as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about \"social medicine\" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the \"Yale System\" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the psychiatry department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful antisemitic colleagues drove him to resign.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor of the Yale campus facing northBefore World War II, most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.[43] Almost all members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and some members of other faculties—teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually.[44]\n\n\n#### Women[edit]\n\n\nIn 1793, Lucinda Foote passed the entrance exams for Yale College, but was rejected by the president on the basis of her gender.[45] Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[46] The first seven women to earn PhDs at Yale received their degrees in 1894: Elizabeth Deering Hanscom, Cornelia H. B. Rogers, Sara Bulkley Rogers, Margaretta Palmer, Mary Augusta Scott, Laura Johnson Wylie, and Charlotte Fitch Roberts. There is a portrait of these seven women in Sterling Memorial Library, painted by Brenda Zlamany.[47]\n\n\nIn 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female and part of the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.[48] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;[49] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[50] at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus.[51]\n\n\nA decade into co-education, student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued Yale for its failure to curtail campus sexual harassment, especially by male faculty. The case was partly built from a 1977 report authored by plaintiff Ann Olivarius, now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual harassment, \"A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus.\"[52] This case was the first to use Title IX to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be considered illegal sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in the case were Olivarius, Ronni Alexander (now a professor at Kobe University, Japan), Margery Reifler (works in the Los Angeles film industry), Pamela Price[53] (district attorney in Alameda County, California), and Lisa E. Stone (works at Anti-Defamation League). They were joined by Yale classics professor John \"Jack\" J. Winkler, who died in 1990. The lawsuit, brought partly by Catharine MacKinnon, alleged rape, fondling, and offers of higher grades for sex by several Yale faculty, including Keith Brion, professor of flute and director of bands, Political Science professor Raymond Duvall[54] (now at the University of Minnesota), English professor Michael Cooke, and the coach of the field hockey team, Richard Kentwell. While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale's Grievance Board and the Yale Women's Center.[55] In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates, including editors of Yale's feminist magazine *Broad Recognition*, alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate.[56] In response, the university formed a Title IX steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct.[57] Afterwards, universities and colleges throughout the US also established sexual harassment grievance procedures.\n\n\n\n#### Class[edit]\n\n\nYale instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to maintain the proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see *numerus clausus*) and eliminated such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.[58]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Yale and Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students.[59] In July 2012, the Yale University-PKU Program ended due to weak participation.[59]\n\n\nIn 2007 outgoing Yale President Rick Levin characterized Yale's institutional priorities: \"First, among the nation's finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders.\"[60]\n\n\nIn 2009, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair picked Yale as one location – the others being Britain's Durham University and Universiti Teknologi Mara – for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's United States Faith and Globalization Initiative.[61] As of 2009, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, \"Debating Globalization\".[62] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair Howard Dean teaches a residential college seminar, \"Understanding Politics and Politicians\".[63] Also in 2009, an alliance was formed among Yale, University College London, and both schools' affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care—a growing field known as translational medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but \"no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL\".[64]\n\n\nIn August 2013, a new partnership with the National University of Singapore led to the opening of Yale-NUS College in Singapore, a joint effort to create a new liberal arts college in Asia featuring a curriculum including both Western and Asian traditions.[65]\n\n\nIn 2017, having been suggested for decades,[66] Yale University renamed Calhoun College, named for slave owner, anti-abolitionist, and white supremacist Vice President John C. Calhoun (it is now Hopper College, after Grace Hopper).[67][68]\n\n\nIn 2020, in the wake of protests around the world focused on racial relations and criminal justice reform, the #CancelYale tag was used on social media to demand that Elihu Yale's name be removed from Yale University. Most support for the change stemmed from politically conservative pundits, such as Mike Cernovich and Ann Coulter, satirizing perceived excesses of online cancel culture.[69] Yale was president of Fort. St George in Madras, a fort of the East India Company in India, which was one of the biggest corporation in the world at the time. The company traded textiles, goods, diamonds, cotton, spices, among others, and was involved in the slave trade in India, with a private army of 260,000 soldiers, twice the size of Britain.[70]\nHis singularly large donation of paintings and books to the college led some critics to argue that Yale relied on money related to the slave-trade for its first scholarships and endowments.[71][72][73][74]\n\n\nIn August 2020, the US Justice Department sued Yale for alleged discrimination against Asian and white candidates on the basis of their race through affirmative action admission policies.[75] In early February 2021, under the new Biden administration, the Justice Department withdrew the lawsuit. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, later won a similar lawsuit against Harvard alleging the same issue.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Yale alumni in politics[edit]\n\n\nThe *Boston Globe* wrote that \"if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national leaders over the past three decades, it's Yale\".[77][*verification needed*] Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. presidential election between 1972 and 2004.[78] Yale-educated presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, and major-party nominees during this period include Hillary Clinton (2016), John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (vice president, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (vice president, 1972). Other Yale alumni who have made serious bids for the presidency during this period include Amy Klobuchar (2020), Tom Steyer (2020), Ben Carson (2016), Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), Paul Tsongas (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992).\n\n\nSeveral explanations have been offered for Yale's representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates.[79][*verification needed*] Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating \"a laboratory for future leaders\", an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster.[79] Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: \"We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.\"[77] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes \"an ethos of organized activity\" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the *Yale Daily News*.[80] Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: \"It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.\"[81] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the \"son and grandson of alumni\", and for a \"member of a politically influential family\".[82] *New York Times* correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and *The Atlantic Monthly* correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.[83]\n\n\nDuring the 1988 presidential election, George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis for having \"foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique\". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis' Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was \"so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it\" and said Yale did not share Harvard's reputation for \"liberalism and elitism\".[84] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, \"In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation\".[83]\n\n\n\n## Administration and organization[edit]\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| School founding\n |\n| --- |\n| **School** | **Year founded** |\n| Yale College | 1701\n |\n| Yale School of Medicine | 1810\n |\n| Yale Divinity School | 1822\n |\n| Yale Law School | 1824\n |\n| Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1847\n |\n| Sheffield Scientific School[a] | 1847\n |\n| Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science | 1852\n |\n| Yale School of Fine Arts | 1869\n |\n| Yale School of Music | 1894\n |\n| Yale School of the Environment | 1900\n |\n| Yale School of Public Health | 1915\n |\n| Yale School of Architecture | 1916\n |\n| Yale School of Nursing | 1923\n |\n| David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University | 1955\n |\n| Yale School of Management | 1976\n |\n| Jackson School of Global Affairs | 2022[40] |\n\n\nThe President and Fellows of Yale College, also known as the Yale Corporation, or board of trustees, is the governing body of the university and consists of thirteen standing committees with separate responsibilities outlined in the by-laws. The corporation has 19 members: three ex officio members, ten successor trustees, and six elected alumni fellows.[85] The university has three major academic components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the twelve professional schools.[86]\n\n\nYale's former president Richard C. Levin was, at the time, one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million.[87] Yale's succeeding president Peter Salovey ranks 40th with a 2020 salary of $1.16 million.[88]\n\n\nThe Yale Provost's Office and similar executive positions have launched several women into prominent university executive positions. In 1977, Provost Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed interim president of Yale and later went on to become president of the University of Chicago, being the first woman to hold either position at each respective school.[89][90] In 1994, Provost Judith Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania.[91] In 2002, Provost Alison Richard became the vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge.[92] In 2003, the dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp, was appointed president of Colgate University and later went on to serve as the president of the Swarthmore College in 2009, and then the first female chancellor of the University of Denver in 2014.[93] In 2004, Provost Dr. Susan Hockfield became the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[94] In 2004, Dean of the Nursing school, Catherine Gilliss, was appointed the dean of Duke University's School of Nursing and vice chancellor for nursing affairs.[95] In 2007, Deputy Provost H. Kim Bottomly was named president of Wellesley College.[96]\n\n\nSimilar examples for men who have served in Yale leadership positions can also be found. In 2004, Dean of Yale College Richard H. Brodhead was appointed as the president of Duke University.[97] In 2008, Provost Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the vice chancellor of the University of Oxford.[98]\n\n\n\n### Staff and labor unions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Federation of Hospital and University Employees\n\nYale University staff are represented by several different unions. Clerical and technical workers are represented by Local 34, and service and maintenance workers are represented by Local 35, both of the same union affiliate UNITE HERE.[99] Unlike similar institutions, Yale has consistently refused to recognize its graduate student union, Local 33 (another affiliate of UNITE HERE), citing claims that the union's elections were undemocratic and how graduate students are not employees;[100][101] the move to not recognize the union has been criticized by the American Federation of Teachers.[102] In addition, officers of the Yale University Police Department are represented by the Yale Police Benevolent Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Employees.[99][103] Yale security officers joined the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America in late 2010,[104] even though the Yale administration contested the election.[105] In October 2014, after deliberation,[106] Yale security decided to form a new union, the Yale University Security Officers Association, which has since represented the campus security officers.[99][107]\n\n\nYale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes.[108][*page needed*] There have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and *The New York Times* wrote that Yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S.[109] Moreover, Yale has been accused by the AFL–CIO of failing to treat workers with respect,[110] as well as not renewing contracts with professors over involvement in campus labor issues.[111] Yale has responded to strikes with claims over mediocre union participation and the benefits of their contracts.[112]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale Law School, located in the Sterling Law Building ![](image)Interior of Beinecke Library\nYale's central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres (1.1 km2) and comprises its main, historic campus and a medical campus adjacent to the Yale–New Haven Hospital. In western New Haven, the university holds 500 acres (2.0 km2) of athletic facilities, including the Yale Golf Course.[113] In 2008, Yale purchased the 17-building, 136-acre (0.55 km2) former Bayer HealthCare complex in West Haven, Connecticut,[114] the buildings of which are now used as laboratory and research space.[115] Yale also owns seven forests in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire—the largest of which is the 7,840-acre (31.7 km2) Yale-Myers Forest in Connecticut's Quiet Corner—and nature preserves including Horse Island.[116]\n\n\nYale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus[117] as well as several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn's Yale Art Gallery[118] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen's Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph's Art & Architecture Building. Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue, which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s.[119] In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the Yale campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States.[120]\n\n\nMany of Yale's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness, including the Yale Drama School.[121][122] Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities, such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes, like a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid,[123] deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon.\n\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Nathan Hale in front of Connecticut Hall\n![](image)Vanderbilt Hall\nOther examples of the Gothic style are on the Old Campus by architects like Henry Austin, Charles C. Haight and Russell Sturgis. Several are associated with members of the Vanderbilt family, including Vanderbilt Hall,[124] Phelps Hall,[125] St. Anthony Hall (a commission for member Frederick William Vanderbilt), the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (the engineering and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of Silliman College, the largest residential college.[126]\n\n\nThe oldest building on campus, Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the Georgian style. Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College, Pierson College, and Davenport College, except the latter's east, York Street façade, which was constructed in the Gothic style to coordinate with adjacent structures.\n\n\nThe Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. The library includes a six-story above-ground tower of book stacks, filled with 180,000 volumes, that is surrounded by large translucent Vermont marble panels and a steel and granite truss. The panels act as windows and subdue direct sunlight while also diffusing the light in warm hues throughout the interior.[127] Near the library is a sunken courtyard with sculptures by Isamu Noguchi that are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube).[128] The library is located near the center of the university in Hewitt Quadrangle, which is now more commonly referred to as \"Beinecke Plaza\".\n\n\nAlumnus Eero Saarinen, Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Washington Dulles International Airport main terminal, Bell Labs Holmdel Complex and the CBS Building in Manhattan, designed Ingalls Rink, dedicated in 1959,[129] as well as the residential colleges Ezra Stiles and Morse.[130] These latter were modeled after the medieval Italian hill town of San Gimignano – a prototype chosen for the town's pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers.[131] These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college's many Gothic spires and Georgian cupolas.[132]\n\n\nThe athletic field complex is partially in New Haven, and partially in West Haven.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nYale's Old Campus at dusk, April 2013\n\n### Notable nonresidential campus buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Harkness Tower\nNotable nonresidential campus buildings and landmarks include Battell Chapel, Beinecke Rare Book Library, Harkness Tower, Humanities Quadrangle, Ingalls Rink, Kline Biology Tower, Osborne Memorial Laboratories, Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Sterling Hall of Medicine, Sterling Law Buildings, Sterling Memorial Library, Woolsey Hall, Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Art Gallery, Yale Art & Architecture Building, and the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in London.\n\n\nYale's secret society buildings (some of which are called \"tombs\") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. A diversity of architectural styles is represented: Berzelius, Donn Barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); Book and Snake, Louis R. Metcalfe in a Greek Ionic style (erected in 1901); Elihu, architect unknown but built in a Colonial style (constructed on an early 17th-century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); Mace and Chain, in a late colonial, early Victorian style (built in 1823). (Interior moulding is said to have belonged to Benedict Arnold);Manuscript Society, King-lui Wu with Dan Kiley responsible for landscaping and Josef Albers for the brickwork intaglio mural. Building constructed in a mid-century modern style; Scroll and Key, Richard Morris Hunt in a Moorish- or Islamic-inspired Beaux-Arts style (erected 1869–70); Skull and Bones, possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin in an Egypto-Doric style utilizing Brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the Neo-Gothic towers in rear garden were completed); St. Elmo, (former tomb) Kenneth M. Murchison, 1912, designs inspired by Elizabethan manor. Current location, brick colonial; and Wolf's Head, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, erected 1923–1924, Collegiate Gothic.\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nYale's Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale.[134] Yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by 2020. As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges.[135] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification.[136] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls.[137] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a \"B+\" grade overall.[138] Yale is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[139]\n\n\n\n* Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven\n* Marsh Botanical Garden\n* Yale Sustainable Food Program Farm\n\n\n### Relationship with New Haven[edit]\n\n\nYale is the largest taxpayer and employer in the City of New Haven,[140] and has often buoyed the city's economy and communities. Yale, however, has consistently opposed paying a tax on its academic property.[141] Yale's Art Galleries, along with many other university resources, are free and openly accessible. Yale also funds the New Haven Promise program, paying full tuition for eligible students from New Haven public schools.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Town–gown relations[edit]\n\n\nYale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in myriad community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Campus safety[edit]\n\n\nSeveral campus safety strategies have been pioneered at Yale. The first campus police force was founded at Yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus.[144][145] Later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior.[146][147] In addition to the Yale Police Department, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a safety escort, and 24-hour shuttle service.\n\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale's student and faculty recruiting efforts.[148] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven's crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the New Haven Police and Yale's campus became the safest among peer schools.[149]\n\n\nIn 2004, the national non-profit watchdog group Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults.[150][151]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Yale announced that it will require students to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of being on campus during the fall 2021 term.[152]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admission to Yale College is considered \"most selective\" by *U.S. News*.[153][154] In 2022, Yale accepted 2,234 students to the Class of 2026 out of 50,015 applicants, for an acceptance rate of 4.46%.[155] 98% of students graduate within six years.[156]\n\n\nThrough its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants, and the university is need-blind for both domestic and international applicants.[157] Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2017 was $46,395.[158] 15% of Yale College students are expected to have no parental contribution, and about 50% receive some form of financial aid.[156][159][160] About 16% of the Class of 2013 had some form of student loan debt at graduation, with an average debt of $13,000 among borrowers.[156] For 2019, Yale ranked second in enrollment of recipients of the National Merit $2,500 Scholarship (140 scholars).[161]\n\n\nHalf of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 39% are ethnic minority U.S. citizens (19% are underrepresented minorities), and 10.5% are international students.[158] 55% attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools, and 97% of students were in the top 10% of their high school class.[156] Every year, Yale College also admits a small group of non-traditional students through the Eli Whitney Students Program.\n\n\n\n### Collections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University's Sterling Memorial Library, as seen from Maya Lin's sculpture, *Women's Table*. The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969.\nYale University Library, which holds over 15 million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in the United States.[9][162] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject and location libraries.\n\n\nRare books are found in several Yale collections. The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary works. The Elizabethan Club, technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale.\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Night Café*, Vincent van Gogh, 1888, Yale Art Gallery\nYale's museum collections are also of international stature. The Yale University Art Gallery, the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartwout and Kahn buildings. The latter, Louis Kahn's first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The Yale Center for British Art, the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building.\n\n\nThe Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments, affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted.\n\n\nThe museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his Yale-financed expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 – when the removal of such artifacts was legal. The artifacts were restored to Peru in 2012.[163]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[164] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[165] | 3 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[166] | 7 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[167] | 4 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[168] | 11 |\n| *QS*[169] | 16 |\n| *THE*[170] | 9 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[171] | 11 |\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR graduate school rankings[172]\n |\n| --- |\n| Business\n | 7\n |\n| Engineering\n | 38\n |\n| Law\n | 1\n |\n| Medicine: Primary Care\n | 59\n |\n| Medicine: Research\n | 10\n |\n| Nursing: doctorate\n | 21\n |\n| Nursing: Master's\n | 20\n |\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR departmental rankings[172]\n |\n| --- |\n| Biological Sciences\n | 6\n |\n| Chemistry\n | 12\n |\n| Clinical Psychology\n | 18\n |\n| Computer Science\n | 20\n |\n| Earth Sciences\n | 19\n |\n| Economics\n | 4\n |\n| English\n | 1\n |\n| Fine Arts\n | 2\n |\n| History\n | 2\n |\n| Mathematics\n | 12\n |\n| Nursing–Midwifery\n | 2\n |\n| Physician Assistant\n | 26\n |\n| Physics\n | 11\n |\n| Political Science\n | 6\n |\n| Psychology\n | 6\n |\n| Public Health\n | 11\n |\n| Sociology\n | 18\n |\n| Statistics\n | 13\n |\n\n\nThe *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Yale third among U.S. national universities for 2016,[153] as it had for each of the previous sixteen years. Yale University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[173]\n\n\nInternationally, Yale was ranked 11th in the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities, tenth in the 2016–17 Nature Index[174] for quality of scientific research output, and tenth in the 2016 CWUR World University Rankings.[175] The university was also ranked sixth in the 2016 Times Higher Education (THE) Global University Employability Rankings[176] and eighth in the Academic World Reputation Rankings.[177] In 2019, it ranked 27th among the universities around the world by *SCImago Institutions Rankings*.[178]\n\n\n\n### Faculty, research, and intellectual traditions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *(March 2021)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nYale is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[179] According to the National Science Foundation, Yale spent $990 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 15th in the nation.[180]\n\n\nYale's current faculty include 67 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[12] 55 members of the National Academy of Medicine,[13] 8 members of the National Academy of Engineering,[14] and 187 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[15] The college is, after normalization for institution size, the tenth-largest baccalaureate source of doctoral degree recipients in the United States, and the largest such source within the Ivy League.[181] It also is a top 10 (ranked seventh) baccalaureate source (after normalization for the number of graduates) of some of the most notable scientists (Nobel, Fields, Turing prizes, or membership in National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, or National Academy of Medicine).[182]\n\n\nYale's English and Comparative Literature departments were part of the New Criticism movement. Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren, W.K. Wimsatt, and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction. Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, taught at the department of comparative literature from the late 1970s to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called \"Yale School\". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C. Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th century. The *Journal of Music Theory* was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars.\n\n\nSince the late 1960s, Yale produces social sciences and policy research through its Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS).\n\n\nIn addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 Postdocs from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the Yale Postdoctoral Association.\n\n\n\n## Campus life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[183] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 35%\n | 35 |\n| Asian | 24%\n | 24 |\n| Hispanic | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Foreign national | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 9%\n | 9 |\n| Other[b] | 6%\n | 6 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[c] | 20%\n | 20 |\n| Affluent[d] | 80%\n | 80 |\n\n\nYale is a research university, with the majority of its students in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates, or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.[184] The median family income of Yale students is $192,600, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 16% from the bottom 60%.[185]\n\n\n\n### Residential colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Residential colleges of Yale University\n\nYale's residential college system was established in 1933 by Edward S. Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \"Master's Teas\", but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college.\n\n\nAll undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.[186] While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the Old Campus, the university's oldest precinct.\n\n\nWhile Harkness' original colleges were Georgian Revival or Collegiate Gothic in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history. In 2017, the university opened two new colleges near Science Hill.[187]\n  \n\n\n\n\n* ![Jonathan Edwards College courtyard](image)\n\nJonathan Edwards College courtyard\n* ![Branford College courtyard](image)\n\nBranford College courtyard\n* ![Saybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard](image)\n\nSaybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard\n* ![Hopper College courtyard](image)\n\nHopper College courtyard\n* ![Berkeley College buildings](image)\n\nBerkeley College buildings\n* ![Trumbull College courtyard](image)\n\nTrumbull College courtyard\n* ![Davenport College courtyard](image)\n\nDavenport College courtyard\n* ![Pierson College courtyard](image)\n\nPierson College courtyard\n* ![Silliman College courtyard](image)\n\nSilliman College courtyard\n* ![Timothy Dwight College courtyard](image)\n\nTimothy Dwight College courtyard\n* ![Morse College courtyard](image)\n\nMorse College courtyard\n* ![Ezra Stiles College courtyard](image)\n\nEzra Stiles College courtyard\n* ![Benjamin Franklin College courtyard](image)\n\nBenjamin Franklin College courtyard\n* ![Pauli Murray College courtyard](image)\n\nPauli Murray College courtyard\n\n\n#### Calhoun College[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1960s, John C. Calhoun's white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership[188][189][190][191] had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. The racially motivated church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change.[189] They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an \"extraordinary American statesman\"—he was \"one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy\" in the history of the United States.[189][190] In August 2015, Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed.[191] He described Calhoun as \"a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina\".[191] He acknowledged that Calhoun also \"believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests.\"[188] Student activism about this issue increased in the fall of 2015, and included further protests sparked by controversy surrounding an administrator's comments on the potential positive and negative implications of students who wear Halloween costumes that are culturally sensitive.[192] Campus-wide discussions expanded to include critical discussion of the experiences of women of color on campus, and the realities of racism in undergraduate life.[193] The protests were sensationalized by the media and led to the labelling of some students as being members of Generation Snowflake.[194]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Salovey announced that \"despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests\", Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college[195] explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's \"shadow\" so they will be \"better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future\". He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would \"obscure\" his \"legacy of slavery rather than addressing it\".[195] \"Yale is part of that history\" and \"We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it.\" One change that will be issued is the title of \"master\" for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to \"head of college\" due to its connotation of slavery.[196]\n\n\nDespite this apparently conclusive reasoning, Salovey announced that Calhoun College would be renamed for groundbreaking computer scientist Grace Hopper in February 2017.[197] This renaming decision received a range of responses from Yale students and alumni.[198][199][200] In his 2019 book *Assault on American Excellence*, former Dean of Yale Law School Anthony T. Kronman criticized the title and name changes and the lack of support from Salovey for the Christakises, who were targeted by the student activists. Other members of the university community disagreed with Kronman's positions.[201]\n\n\n\n### Student organizations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the process of registration.[202]\n\n\nThe university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. The Yale Literary Magazine, founded in February 1836, is the oldest student literary magazine in the United States.[203] Established in 1872, *The Yale Record* is the world's oldest humor magazine. Newspapers include the *Yale Daily News*, which was first published in 1878, and the weekly *Yale Herald*, which was first published in 1986. The *Yale Journal of Medicine & Law* is a biannual magazine that explores the intersection of law and medicine.\n\n\nDwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition[204] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio[205] is the campus's radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM and FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream.\n\n\nThe Yale College Council (YCC) serves as the campus's undergraduate student government. All registered student organizations are regulated and funded by a subsidiary organization of the YCC, known as the Undergraduate Organizations Funding Committee (UOFC).[206] The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) serves as Yale's graduate and professional student government.\n\n\nThe Yale Political Union (YPU) is a debate society founded in 1934 to host student discussions on a wide variety of topics. It is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry and George Pataki.\n\n\nThe Yale International Relations Association (YIRA) functions as the umbrella organization for the university's top-ranked Model UN team. YIRA also has a Europe-based offshoot, Yale Model Government Europe, other Model UN conferences such as YMUN, YMUN Korea, YMUN Taiwan and Yale Model African Union (YMAU), and educational programs such as the Yale Review of International Studies (YRIS), Yale International Relations Leadership Institute, and Hemispheres.\n\n\nThe campus includes several fraternities and sororities. The campus features at least 18 a cappella groups, the most famous of which is The Whiffenpoofs, which from its founding in 1909 until 2018 was made up solely of senior men.\n\n\nThe Elizabethan Club, a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the \"Lizzie's\" premises for conversation and tea. The club owns first editions of a Shakespeare Folio, several Shakespeare Quartos, and a first edition of Milton's *Paradise Lost*, among other important literary texts.\n\n\n\n#### Secret societies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yale secret societies\n\nYale's secret societies include Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Wolf's Head, Book and Snake, Elihu, Berzelius, St. Elmo, Manuscript, Brothers in Unity, Linonia, St. Anthony Hall, Shabtai, Myth and Sword, Daughters of Sovereign Government (DSG), Mace and Chain, ISO, Spade and Grave, and Sage and Chalice, among others. The two oldest existing honor societies are the Aurelian (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916).[207]\n\n\nThese are akin to Harvard finals clubs, Princeton eating clubs, and senior societies at University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bladderball\n\nYale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their \"bright college years\", though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with \"bubble pipes\".[208][209] (\"Bright College Years\", the university's alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand, Class of 1881, to the tune of *Die Wacht am Rhein*.) Yale's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus; however, actual students rarely do so.[210] In the second half of the 20th century Bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014.[211][212][213]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yale Bulldogs\n\n![](image)The Yale Bowl, the college football stadium\nYale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships.\n\n\nYale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation's first natural \"bowl\" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world.[214]\n\n\nIn 1970 the NCAA banned Yale from participating in all NCAA sports for two years, in reaction to Yale – against the wishes of the NCAA – playing its Jewish center Jack Langer in college games after Langer had played for Team United States at the 1969 Maccabiah Games in Israel with the approval of Yale President Kingman Brewster.[215][216][217][218] The decision impacted 300 Yale students, every Yale student on its sports teams, over the next two years.[219]\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the men's basketball team won the Ivy League Championship title for the first time in 54 years, earning a spot in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. In the first round of the tournament, the Bulldogs beat the Baylor Bears 79–75 in the school's first-ever tournament win.[220]\n\n![](image)The Walter Camp Gate at the Yale Athletic Complex\nIn May 2018, the men's lacrosse team defeated the Duke Blue Devils to claim their first-ever NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship,[221] and were the first Ivy League school to win the title since the Princeton Tigers in 2001.[222]\n\n\nYale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won Olympic Games Gold Medal for men's eights in 1924 and 1956. The Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale's fourth new boathouse in 157 years of collegiate rowing. The Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder '79 and her father Richard Gilder '54, who gave $4 million towards the $7.5 million project. Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men's team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race.\n\n\nIn 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game.[223]\n\n\nYale students claim to have invented Frisbee, by tossing empty Frisbie Pie Company tins.[224][225]\n\n\nYale athletics are supported by the Yale Precision Marching Band. \"Precision\" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching.[226] The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter.\n\n\nYale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about 10 different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup.\n\n\n\n#### Song[edit]\n\n\nNotable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement, convocation, alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, \"Bright College Years\". Despite its popularity, \"Boola Boola\" is not the official fight song, albeit being the origin of the university's unofficial motto. The official Yale fight song, \"Bulldog\" was written by Cole Porter during his undergraduate days and is sung after touchdowns during a football game.[227] Additionally, two other songs, \"Down the Field\" by C.W. O'Conner, and \"Bingo Eli Yale\", also by Cole Porter, are still sung at football games. According to *College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology* published in 1998, \"Down the Field\" ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time.[228]\n\n\n\n#### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe school mascot is \"Handsome Dan\", the Yale bulldog, and the Yale fight song contains the refrain, \"Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow.\" The school color, since 1894, is Yale Blue.[229] Yale's Handsome Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889.[230]\n\n\n\n### Mental health[edit]\n\n\nYale has faced significant criticism for its handling of student mental health on campus.[231][232][233][234] Suicidal and depressed students say that Yale forced them to medically withdraw rather than provide them with academic accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and in 2018 the Ruderman Family Foundation ranked Yale as having the worst mental health policies in the Ivy League.[235][236][233]\n\n\n\n> \n> Dear Yale, I loved being here. I only wish I could've had some time. I needed time to work things out and to wait for new medication to kick in, but I couldn't do it in school, and I couldn't bear the thought of having to leave for a full year, or of leaving and never being readmitted. Love, Luchang.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nLuchang Wang, posted on Facebook in 2015 shortly before her death[231][234][237][238][239]\n\nStudents at Yale say that the university's policies force them to hide their depression and avoid seeking help, for fear of being forced to leave.[231][235][234] One prominent case was the suicide of Luchang Wang in 2015, who died by suicide after making a Facebook post saying that she needed time to deal with her mental health issues, but could not deal with being forced to medically withdraw for an entire year with an uncertain chance of being readmitted.[237][234][239] Wang had previously withdrawn from school due to mental health issues, and was afraid of being forced to withdraw again, as a second readmission attempt would be considerably more difficult for her.[237][234] A friend of Wang said that she routinely lied to her university therapist to avoid being kicked out,[237] and another student said that many at Yale lie to their counselors as \"there's no clear standard established that says exactly what students will get involuntarily hospitalized or withdrawn for\".[234] In response, the university convened a commission to evaluate their readmission policies after a mental health withdrawal, renaming the process to \"reinstatement\" as well as eliminating the $50 reapplication fee.[231]\n\n\nFor students that do seek help, waitlists for therapy can be months long, with individual counselling sessions only 30 minutes in length.[231] In 2022, after a Washington Post article about their medical withdrawal policies, the school increased the number of mental health clinicians on campus from 51 to 60 as well as promised further changes.[232] In 2023, after a lawsuit was filed against the school for what the plaintiffs described as discrimination, the university changed the name of a \"medical withdrawal\" to a \"medical leave of absence\" saying that the \"leave of absence\" terminology would allow students to remain on Yale's insurance while away from the school.[240] The new policy also allowed for students on a leave of absence to participate in extracurricular clubs and visit campus,[240] something a student on medical withdrawal was banned from doing.[231] A representative of Yale also said that the criticism of their policies \"misrepresents our efforts and unwavering commitment to supporting our students, whose well-being and success are our primary focus\" and that \"the mental health of our students is a very, very high priority\".[232]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Benefactors[edit]\n\n\nYale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: Elihu Yale, Jeremiah Dummer, the Vanderbilt family, the Harkness family (Edward, Anna, and William), the Beinecke family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter), John William Sterling, Payne Whitney, Joseph Earl Sheffield, Paul Mellon, Charles B. G. Murphy, Joseph Tsai, William K. Lanman, and Stephen Schwarzman. The Yale Class of 1954, led by Richard Gilder, donated $70 million in commemoration of their 50th reunion.[241] Charles B. Johnson, a 1954 graduate of Yale College, pledged a $250 million gift in 2013 to support the construction of two new residential colleges.[242] The colleges have been named respectively in honor of Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin. A $100 million contribution[243] by Stephen Adams enabled the Yale School of Music to become tuition-free and the Adams Center for Musical Arts to be built, while a $150 million contribution[244] by David Geffen enabled the Yale School of Drama (renamed the David Geffen School of Drama at Yale) to become tuition-free as well.\n\n\n\n### Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Yale University people, List of Yale Law School alumni, and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Yale University\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long to read and navigate comfortably**.

For example, Owen Johnson's novel *Stover at Yale* follows the college career of Dink Stover,[379] and Frank Merriwell, the model for all later juvenile sports fiction, plays football, baseball, crew, and track at Yale while solving mysteries and righting wrongs.[380][381] Yale University also is mentioned in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel *The Great Gatsby*. The narrator, Nick Carraway, wrote a series of editorials for the *Yale News*, and Tom Buchanan was \"one of the most powerful ends that ever played football\" for Yale.\n\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sheffield was originally named Yale Scientific School; it was renamed in 1861 after a major donation from Joseph E.

Founded in 1746 in Elizabeth as the  **College of New Jersey**, Princeton is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[8][9][a] The institution moved to Newark in 1747, and then to the current site nine years later. It officially became a university in 1896 and was subsequently renamed Princeton University.\n\n\nThe university is governed by the Trustees of Princeton University and has an endowment of $37.7 billion, the largest endowment per student in the United States. Princeton provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering to approximately 8,500 students on its 600 acres (2.4 km2) main campus. It offers postgraduate degrees through the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School of Architecture and the Bendheim Center for Finance. The university also manages the Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and is home to the NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\" and has one of the largest university libraries in the world.[14]\n\n\nPrinceton uses a residential college system and is known for its upperclassmen eating clubs. The university has over 500 student organizations. Princeton students embrace a wide variety of traditions from both the past and present. The university is a NCAA Division I school and competes in the Ivy League. The school's athletic team, the Princeton Tigers, has won the most titles in its conference and has sent many students and alumni to the Olympics.\n\n\nAs of October 2021, 75 Nobel laureates, 16 Fields Medalists and 16 Turing Award laureates have been affiliated with Princeton University as alumni, faculty members, or researchers. In addition, Princeton has been associated with 21 National Medal of Science awardees, 5 Abel Prize awardees, 11 National Humanities Medal recipients, 217 Rhodes Scholars, 137 Marshall Scholars, and\n62 Gates Cambridge Scholars. Two U.S. presidents, twelve U.S. Supreme Court Justices (three of whom currently serve on the court) and numerous living industry and media tycoons and foreign heads of state are all counted among Princeton's alumni body. Princeton has graduated many members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Cabinet, including eight Secretaries of State, three Secretaries of Defense and two Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Princeton University\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![A drawing of the Log College](image)The Log College, an influential aspect of Princeton's development\nPrinceton University, founded as the College of New Jersey, was shaped much in its formative years by the \"Log College\", a seminary founded by the Reverend William Tennent at Neshaminy, Pennsylvania, in about 1726. While no legal connection ever existed, many of the pupils and adherents from the Log College would go on to financially support and become substantially involved in the early years of the university.[12] While early writers considered it as the predecessor of the university,[15] the idea has been rebuked by Princeton historians.[16][12]\n\n\nThe founding of the university itself originated from a split in the Presbyterian church following the Great Awakening.[17] In 1741, New Light Presbyterians were expelled from the Synod of Philadelphia in defense of how the Log College ordained ministers.[18] The four founders of the College of New Jersey, who were New Lights, were either expelled or withdrew from the Synod and devised a plan to establish a new college, for they were disappointed with Harvard and Yale's opposition to the Great Awakening and dissatisfied with the limited instruction at the Log College.[18][17] They convinced three other Presbyterians to join them and decided on New Jersey as the location for the college, as at the time, there was no institution between Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut, and the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia; it was also where some of the founders preached.[19] Although their initial request was rejected by the Anglican governor Lewis Morrison, the acting governor after Morrison's death, John Hamilton, granted a charter for the College of New Jersey on October 22, 1746.[20][19] In 1747, approximately five months after acquiring the charter, the trustees elected Jonathan Dickinson as president and opened in Elizabeth, New Jersey,[20] where classes were held in Dickinson's parsonage.[21] With its founding, it became the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, and one of nine colonial colleges charted before the American Revolution.[8][9] The founders aimed for the college to have an expansive curriculum to teach people of various professions, not solely ministerial work.[22][20] Though the school was open to those of any religious denomination,[23] with many of the founders being of Presbyterian faith, the college became the educational and religious capital of Scotch-Irish Presbyterian America.[24]\n\n\n\n### Colonial and early years[edit]\n\n\n![An engraving of Nassau Hall from 1760](image)From 1760, the first picture of Nassau Hall\nIn 1747, following the death of then President Jonathan Dickinson, the college moved from Elizabeth to Newark, New Jersey, as that was where presidential successor Aaron Burr Sr.'s parsonage was located.[20] That same year, Princeton's first charter came under dispute by Anglicans, but on September 14, 1748, the recently appointed governor Jonathan Belcher granted a second charter.[25][26] Belcher, a Congregationalist, had become alienated from his alma mater, Harvard, and decided to \"adopt\" the infant college.[25][23] Belcher would go on to raise funds for the college and donate his 474-volume library, making it one of the largest libraries in the colonies.[25][27]\n\n\n\nIn 1756, the college moved again to its present home in Princeton, New Jersey, because Newark was felt to be too close to New York.[28][29] Princeton was chosen for its central location in New Jersey and by strong recommendation by Belcher.[25][30] The college's home in Princeton was Nassau Hall, named for the royal William III of England, a member of the House of Orange-Nassau.[31] The trustees of the College of New Jersey initially suggested that Nassau Hall be named in recognition of Belcher because of his interest in the institution; the governor vetoed the request.[25] \n\n![A portrait of John Witherspoon](image)John Witherspoon, President of the college (1768–94) and signer of the Declaration of Independence\nBurr, who would die in 1757, devised a curriculum for the school and enlarged the student body.[32] Following the untimely death of Burr and the college's next three presidents,[33] John Witherspoon became president in 1768 and remained in that post until his death in 1794.[34] With his presidency, Witherspoon focused the college on preparing a new generation of both educated clergy and secular leadership in the new American nation.[35][36] To this end, he tightened academic standards, broadened the curriculum, solicited investment for the college, and grew its size.[37][36]\n\n\nA signer of the Declaration of Independence, Witherspoon and his leadership led the college to becoming influential to the American Revolution.[34][38][39] In 1777, the college became the site for the Battle of Princeton.[34] During the battle, British soldiers briefly occupied Nassau Hall before eventually surrendering to American forces led by General George Washington.[40] During the summer and fall of 1783, the Continental Congress and Washington met in Nassau Hall, making Princeton the country's capital for four months;[41] Nassau Hall is where Congress learned of the peace treaty between the colonies and the British.[42][43] The college did suffer from the revolution, with a depreciated endowment and hefty repair bills for Nassau Hall.[44]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1795, President Samuel Stanhope Smith took office, the first alumnus to become president.[45] Nassau Hall suffered a large fire that destroyed its interior in 1802, which Smith blamed on rebellious students.[46] The college raised funds for reconstruction, as well as the construction of two new buildings.[47] In 1807, a large student riot occurred at Nassau Hall, spurred by underlying distrust of educational reforms by Smith away from the Church.[45][48] Following Smith's mishandling of the situation, falling enrollment, and faculty resignations, the trustees of the university offered resignation to Smith, which he accepted.[47] In 1812, Ashbel Green was unanimously elected by the trustees of the college to become the eighth president.[49] After the liberal tenure of Smith, Green represented the conservative \"Old Side,\" in which he introduced rigorous disciplinary rules and heavily embraced religion.[50][51] Even so, believing the college was not religious enough, he took a prominent role in establishing the Princeton Theological Seminary next door.[50][49] While student riots were a frequent occurrence during Green's tenure, enrollment did increase under his administration.[52]\n\n\n\nIn 1823, James Carnahan became president, arriving as an unprepared and timid leader.[53][54] With the college riven by conflicting views between students, faculty, and trustees, and enrollment hitting its lowest in years, Carnahan considered closing the university.[53] Carnahan's successor, John Maclean Jr., who was only a professor at the time, recommended saving the university with the help of alumni; as a result, Princeton's alumni association, led by James Madison, was created and began raising funds.[53][55] With Carnahan and Maclean, now vice-president, working as partners, enrollment and faculty increased, tensions decreased, and the college campus expanded.[55] Maclean took over the presidency in 1854, and led the university through the American Civil War.[56] When Nassau Hall burned down again in 1855,[57] Maclean raised funds and used the money to rebuild Nassau Hall and run the university on an austerity budget during the war years.[56] With a third of students from the college being from the South, enrollment fell.[58] Once many of the Southerners left, the campus became a sharp proponent for the Union,[59] even bestowing an honorary degree to President Lincoln.[60]\n\n![A portrait of James McCosh](image)James McCosh, President of the college (1868–88)James McCosh became the college's president in 1868, and lifted the institution out of a low period that had been brought about by the war.[61] During his two decades of service, he overhauled the curriculum, oversaw an expansion of inquiry into the sciences, recruited distinguished faculty, and supervised the addition of a number of buildings in the High Victorian Gothic style to the campus.[61][62] McCosh's tenure also saw the creation and rise of many extracurricular activities, like the Princeton Glee Club, the Triangle Club, the first intercollegiate football team, and the first permanent eating club,[63] as well as the elimination of fraternities and sororities.[64] In 1879, Princeton conferred its first doctorates on James F. Williamson and William Libby, both members of the Class of 1877.[65]\n\n\nFrancis Patton took the presidency in 1888, and although his election was not met by unanimous enthusiasm, he was well received by undergraduates.[66] Patton's administration was marked with great change, for Princeton's enrollment and faculty had doubled. At the same time, the college underwent large expansion and social life was changing in reflection of the rise in eating clubs and burgeoning interest in athletics.[67] In 1893, the honor system was established, allowing for unproctored exams.[68][69] In 1896, the college officially became a university,[70] and as a result, it officially changed its name to Princeton University.[71] In 1900, the Graduate School was formally established.[70] Even with such accomplishments, Patton's administration remained lackluster with its administrative structure[72] and towards its educational standards.[68] Due to profile changes in the board of trustees and dissatisfaction with his administration, he was forced to resign in 1902.[72]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![A portrait of Woodrow Wilson as president of Princeton](image)Woodrow Wilson, President of Princeton University (1902–10) and 28th president of the United States\nFollowing Patton's resignation, Woodrow Wilson, an alumnus and popular professor, was elected the 13th president of the university.[73][74] Noticing falling academic standards, Wilson orchestrated significant changes to the curriculum, where freshman and sophomores followed a unified curriculum while juniors and seniors concentrated study in one discipline.[75] Ambitious seniors were allowed to undertake independent work, which would eventually shape Princeton's emphasis on the practice for the future.[76] Wilson further reformed the educational system by introducing the preceptorial system in 1905,[75] a then-unique concept in the United States that augmented the standard lecture method of teaching with a more personal form in which small groups of students, or precepts, could interact with a single instructor, or preceptor, in their field of interest.[77] The changes brought about many new faculty and cemented Princeton's academics for the first half of the 20th century.[78] Due to the tightening of academic standards, enrollment declined severely until 1907.[75] In 1906, the reservoir Lake Carnegie was created by Andrew Carnegie,[79] and the university officially became nonsectarian.[80] Before leaving office, Wilson strengthened the science program to focus on \"pure\" research and broke the Presbyterian lock on the board of trustees.[73][81] However, he did fail in winning support for the permanent location of the Graduate School and the elimination of the eating clubs, which he proposed replacing with quadrangles, a precursor to the residential college system.[82] Wilson also continued to keep Princeton closed off from accepting Black students.[83] When an aspiring Black student wrote a letter to Wilson, he got his secretary to reply telling him to attend a university where he would be more welcome.[84]\n\n\nJohn Grier Hibben became president in 1912, and would remain in the post for two decades.[85] On October 2, 1913, the Princeton University Graduate College was dedicated.[79] When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Hibben allocated all available University resources to the government. As a result, military training schools opened on campus and laboratories and other facilities were used for research and operational programs. Overall, more than 6,000 students served in the armed forces, with 151 dying during the war.[86] After the war, enrollment spiked and the trustees established the system of selective admission in 1922.[87] From the 1920s to the 1930s, the student body featured many students from preparatory schools, zero Black students, and dwindling Jewish enrollment because of quotas.[88] Aside from managing Princeton during WWI, Hibben introduced the senior thesis in 1923 as a part of The New Plan of Study.[89][90] He also brought about great expansion to the university, with the creation of the School of Architecture in 1919, the School of Engineering in 1921, and the School of Public and International Affairs in 1930.[91] By the end of his presidency, the endowment had increased by 374 percent, the total area of the campus doubled, the faculty experienced impressive growth, and the enrollment doubled.[92][90]\n\n\nHibben's successor, Harold Willis Dodds would lead the university through the Great Depression, World War II, and the Korean Conflict.[93] With the Great Depression, many students were forced to withdraw due to financial reasons.[94] At the same time, Princeton's reputation in physics and mathematics surged as many European scientists left for the United States due to uneasy tension caused by Nazi Germany.[95] In 1930, the Institute for Advanced Study was founded to provide a space for the influx of scientists, such as Albert Einstein.[96] Many Princeton scientists would work on the Manhattan Project during the war, [97] including the entire physics department.[98] During World War II, Princeton offered an accelerated program for students to graduate early before entering the armed forces.[99] Student enrollment fluctuated from month to month, and many faculty were forced to teach unfamiliar subjects. Still, Dodds maintained academic standards and would establish a program for servicemen, so they could resume their education once discharged.[100]\n\n\n\n### 1945 to present[edit]\n\n\nPost-war years saw scholars renewing broken bonds through numerous conventions, expansion of the campus, and the introduction of distribution requirements.[101][102] The period saw the desegregation of Princeton, which was stimulated by changes to the New Jersey constitution.[103] Princeton began undertaking a sharper focus towards research in the years after the war, with the construction of Firestone Library in 1948 and the establishment of the Forrestal Research Center in the 1950s.[104] Government sponsored research increased sharply, particularly in the physics and engineering departments,[105] with much of it occurring at the new Forrestal campus.[106] Though, as the years progressed, scientific research at the Forrestal campus declined, and in 1973, some of the land was converted to commercial and residential spaces.[107]\n\n\nRobert Goheen would succeed Dodds by unanimous vote and serve as president until 1972.[108] Goheen's presidency was characterized as being more liberal than previous presidents, and his presidency would see a rise in Black applicants,[109] as well as the eventual coeducation of the university in 1969.[110] During this period of rising diversity, the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center) was dedicated in 1971.[111] Goheen also oversaw great expansion for the university, with square footage increasing by 80 percentage.[112]\n\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Princeton experienced unprecedented activism, with most of it centered on the Vietnam War.[113][114] While Princeton activism initially remained relatively timid compared to other institutions,[113] protests began to grow with the founding of a local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in 1965, which organized many of the later Princeton protests.[113] In 1966, the SDS gained prominence on campus following picketing against a speech by President Lyndon B. Johnson, which gained frontpage coverage by the *New York Times.*[115][116] A notable point of contention on campus was the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) and would feature multiple protests,[113] some of which required police action.[117] As the years went on, the protests' agenda broadened to investments in South Africa, environmental issues, and women's rights.[113][118] In response to these broadening protests, the Council of the Princeton University Community (CPUC) was founded to serve as a method for greater student voice in governance.[119] Activism culminated in 1970 with a student, faculty, and staff member strike, so the university could become an \"institution against expansion of the war.\"[120][b] Princeton's protests would taper off later that year, with *The* *Daily Princetonian* saying that, \"Princeton 1970–71 was an emotionally burned out university.\"\n\n\nIn 1982, the residential college system was officially established under Goheen's successor William G. Bowen, who would serve until 1988.[121][122] During his presidency, Princeton's endowment increased from $625 million to $2 billion, and a major fundraising drive known as \"A Campaign for Princeton\" was conducted.[122] President Harold T. Shapiro would succeed Bowen and remain president until 2001. Shapiro would continue to increase the endowment, expand academic programs, raise student diversity, and oversee the most renovations in Princeton's history.[123] One of Shapiro's initiatives was the formation of the multidisciplinary Princeton Environmental Institute in 1994, renamed the High Meadows Environmental Institute in 2020.[124][125] In 2001, Princeton shifted the financial aid policy to a system that replaced all loans with grants.[126] That same year, Princeton elected its first female president, Shirley M. Tilghman.[127] Before retiring in 2012, Tilghman expanded financial aid offerings and conducted several major construction projects like the Lewis Center for the Arts and a sixth residential college.[128] Tilghman also lead initiatives for more global programs, the creation of an office of sustainability, and investments into the sciences.[129]\n\n\nPrinceton's 20th and current president Christopher Eisgruber was elected in 2013.[130] In 2017, Princeton University unveiled a large-scale public history and digital humanities investigation into its historical involvement with slavery called the Princeton & Slavery Project. The project saw the publication of hundreds of primary sources, 80 scholarly essays, a scholarly conference, a series of short plays, and an art project.[131] In April 2018, university trustees announced that they would name two public spaces for James Collins Johnson and Betsey Stockton, enslaved people who lived and worked on Princeton's campus and whose stories were publicized by the project.[132] In 2019, large-scale student activism again entered the mainstream concerning the school's implementation of federal Title IX policy relating to Campus sexual assault.[133][134] The activism consisted of sit-ins in response to a student's disciplinary sentence.[135]\n\n\n\n### Coeducation[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton explicitly prohibited the admission of women from its founding in 1746 until 1969. Since it lacked an affiliated women's college, it was often referred to as a \"monastery\", both lovingly and derisively, by members of the Princeton community.[136][137]\nFor about a decade, from 1887 to 1897, nearby Evelyn College for Women was largely comprised of daughters of professors and sisters of Princeton undergraduates. While no legal connection existed, many Princeton professors taught there and several Princeton administrations, like Francis Patton, were on its board of trustees. It closed in 1897 following the death of its founder, Joshua McIlvaine.[138]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pyne Hall, where the first female students lived on campus.\nIn 1947, three female members of the library staff enrolled in beginner Russian courses to deal with an increase in Russian literature in the library.[110]\n\n\nIn 1961, Princeton admitted its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meservey,[136] who would go on to be the first woman to earn a master's degree at Princeton.[110] Meservey was, at the time of her admission, already a member of the faculty at Douglass College within Princeton. The dean of the graduate school issued a statement clarifying that Meservey's admission was an exception, and that \"Princeton may permit other women in the future as special cases, but does not plan to make general admissions of women graduate students.\"[139] The student-run *Daily Princetonian* ran four articles about Meservey in one issue,[139][140][141][142] including an editorial lamenting the potential \"far reaching implications\" of Meservey's admission which concluded: \"Princeton is unique as an undergraduate men's college and must remain so.\"[142] Eight more women enrolled the following year in the Graduate School.[136] In 1964, T'sai-ying Cheng became the first woman at Princeton to receive a Ph.D. In 1963, five women came to Princeton for one year to study \"critical languages\" as undergraduates, but were not candidates for a Princeton degree.[110] Following abortive discussions with Sarah Lawrence College to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the university in 1967,[143] the administration commissioned a report on admitting women. The final report was issued in January 1969, supporting the idea.[110] That same month, Princeton's trustees voted 24–8 in favor of coeducation and began preparing the institution for the transition.[144] The university finished these plans in April 1969 and announced there would be coeducation in September.[145] Ultimately, 101 female freshman and 70 female transfer students enrolled at Princeton in September 1969.[146][145][c] Those admitted were housed in Pyne Hall, a fairly isolated dormitory; a security system was added, although the women deliberately broke it within a day.[148]\n\n\nIn 1971, Mary St. John Douglas and Susan Savage Speers became the first female trustees,[110] and in 1974, quotas for men and women were eliminated.[149] Following a 1979 lawsuit, the eating clubs were required to go coeducational in 1991, after an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.[150] In 2001, Princeton elected its first female president.[127]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Washington Road Elm Allée, which is one of the entrances to the campus](image)The eastern side of the Washington Road Elm Allée, one of the entrances to the campus\nThe main campus consists of more than 200 buildings on 600 acres (2.4 km2) in Princeton, New Jersey.[4] The James Forrestal Campus, a smaller location designed mainly as a research and instruction complex, is split between nearby Plainsboro and South Brunswick. The campuses are situated about one hour from both New York City and Philadelphia on the train.[151] The university also owns more than 520 acres (2.1 km2) of property in West Windsor Township,[4] and is where Princeton is planning to construct a graduate student housing complex, which will be known as \"Lake Campus North\".[152]\n\n\nThe first building on campus was Nassau Hall, completed in 1756, and situated on the northern edge of the campus facing Nassau Street.[153] The campus expanded steadily around Nassau Hall during the early and middle 19th century.[154][155] The McCosh presidency (1868–88) saw the construction of a number of buildings in the High Victorian Gothic and Romanesque Revival styles, although many of them are now gone, leaving the remaining few to appear out of place.[156] At the end of the 19th century, much of Princeton's architecture was designed by the Cope and Stewardson firm (led by the same University of Pennsylvania professors of architecture who designed a large part of Washington University in St. Louis and University of Pennsylvania) resulting in the Collegiate Gothic style for which Princeton is known for today.[157] Implemented initially by William Appleton Potter,[157] and later enforced by the university's supervising architect, Ralph Adams Cram,[158] the Collegiate Gothic style remained the standard for all new building on the Princeton campus until 1960.[159][160] A flurry of construction projects in the 1960s produced a number of new buildings on the south side of the main campus, many of which have been poorly received.[161] Several prominent architects have contributed some more recent additions, including Frank Gehry (Lewis Library),[162] I. M. Pei (Spelman Halls),[163] Demetri Porphyrios (Whitman College, a Collegiate Gothic project),[164] Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown (Frist Campus Center, among several others),[165] Minoru Yamasaki (Robertson Hall),[166] and Rafael Viñoly (Carl Icahn Laboratory).[167]\n\n\nA group of 20th-century sculptures scattered throughout the campus forms the Putnam Collection of Sculpture. It includes works by Alexander Calder (*Five Disks: One Empty*), Jacob Epstein (*Albert Einstein*), Henry Moore (*Oval with Points*), Isamu Noguchi (*White Sun*), and Pablo Picasso (*Head of a Woman*).[168] Richard Serra's *The Hedgehog and The Fox* is located between Peyton and Fine halls next to Princeton Stadium and the Lewis Library.[169]\n\n\nAt the southern edge of the campus is Lake Carnegie, an artificial lake named for Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie financed the lake's construction in 1906 at the behest of a friend and his brother who were both Princeton alumni.[170] Carnegie hoped the opportunity to take up rowing would inspire Princeton students to forsake football, which he considered \"not gentlemanly.\"[171] The Shea Rowing Center on the lake's shore continues to serve as the headquarters for Princeton rowing.[172]\n\n\nPrinceton's grounds were designed by Beatrix Farrand between 1912 and 1943. Her contributions were most recently recognized with the naming of a courtyard for her.[173] Subsequent changes to the landscape were introduced by Quennell Rothschild & Partners in 2000. In 2005, Michael Van Valkenburgh was hired as the new consulting landscape architect for Princeton's 2016 Campus Plan.[174] Lynden B. Miller was invited to work with him as Princeton's consulting gardening architect, focusing on the 17 gardens that are distributed throughout the campus.[175]\n\n\n\n### Buildings[edit]\n\n\n#### Nassau Hall[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Nassau Hall, the university's oldest building](image)Nassau Hall, the university's oldest building and former capitol of the United States. Pictured in front is Cannon Green.\nNassau Hall is the oldest building on campus. Begun in 1754 and completed in 1756,[176] it was the first seat of the New Jersey Legislature in 1776,[177] was involved in the Battle of Princeton in 1777,[178] and was the seat of the Congress of the Confederation (and thus capitol of the United States) from June 30, 1783, to November 4, 1783.[179] Since 1911, the front entrance has been flanked by two bronze tigers, a gift of the Princeton Class of 1879, which replaced two lions previously given in 1889.[180] Starting in 1922, commencement has been held on the front lawn of Nassau Hall when there is good weather.[181] In 1966, Nassau Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[182] Nowadays, it houses the office of the university president and other administrative offices.[183][184]\n\n\nTo the south of Nassau Hall lies a courtyard that is known as Cannon Green.[185] Buried in the ground at the center is the \"Big Cannon,\" which was left in Princeton by British troops as they fled following the Battle of Princeton. It remained in Princeton until the War of 1812, when it was taken to New Brunswick.[186] In 1836, the cannon was returned to Princeton and placed at the eastern end of town. Two years later, it was moved to the campus under cover of night by Princeton students, and in 1840, it was buried in its current location.[187] A second \"Little Cannon\" is buried in the lawn in front of nearby Whig Hall. The cannon, which may also have been captured in the Battle of Princeton, was stolen by students of Rutgers University in 1875. The theft ignited the Rutgers-Princeton Cannon War. A compromise between the presidents of Princeton and Rutgers ended the war and forced the return of the Little Cannon to Princeton.[187] The protruding cannons are occasionally painted scarlet by Rutgers students who continue the traditional dispute.[188][189]\n\n\n\n#### Art Museum[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Princeton University Art Museum](image)The Princeton University Art Museum, which holds over 112,000 objects\nThough art collection at the university dates back to its very founding, the Princeton University Art Museum was not officially established until 1882 by President McCosh. Its establishment arose from a desire to provide direct access to works of art in a museum for a curriculum in the arts, an education system familiar to many European universities at the time. The museum took on the purposes of providing \"exposure to original works of art and to teach the history of art through an encyclopedic collection of world art.\"[190]\n\n\nNumbering over 112,000 objects, the collections range from ancient to contemporary art and come from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.[191] The museum's art is divided into ten extensive curatorial areas.[192] There is a collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, including ceramics, marbles, bronzes, and Roman mosaics from faculty excavations in Antioch, as well as other art from the ancient Egyptian, Byzantium, and Islamic worlds.[193] The non-Islamic coins were catalogued by Dorothy B. Waage.[194] Medieval Europe is represented by sculpture, metalwork, and stained glass. The collection of Western European paintings includes examples from the early Renaissance through the 19th century, with pieces by Monet, Cézanne, and Van Gogh,[195] and features a growing collection of 20th-century and contemporary art, including paintings such as Andy Warhol's Blue Marilyn.[196]\n\n\nThe museum features a collection of Chinese and Japanese art, with holdings in bronzes, tomb figurines, painting, and calligraphy, as well as collections of Korean, Southeast, and Central Asian art.[197] Its collection of pre-Columbian art includes examples of Mayan and Olmec art, and its indigenous art ranges from Chile to Alaska to Greenland.[198] The museum has collections of old master prints and drawings,[199] and it has a comprehensive collection of over 20,000 photographs.[200] Approximately 750 works of African art are represented.[201] The Museum oversees the outside John B. Putnam, Jr., Memorial Collection of Sculpture.[202]\n\n\n\n#### University Chapel[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of the Princeton University Chapel](image)Finished in 1928, the Princeton University Chapel seats 2,000 people.\nThe Princeton University Chapel is located on the north side of campus near Nassau Street. It was built between 1924 and 1928 at a cost of $2.3 million,[203] approximately $40.8 million adjusted for inflation in 2020. Ralph Adams Cram, the university's supervising architect, designed the chapel, which he viewed as the crown jewel for the Collegiate Gothic motif he had championed for the campus.[204] At the time of its construction, it was the second largest university chapel in the world, after King's College Chapel, Cambridge.[205] It underwent a two-year, $10 million restoration campaign between 2000 and 2002.[206] The Chapel seats around 2,000 and serves as a site for religious services and local celebrations.[207]\n\n\nMeasured on the exterior, the chapel is 277 feet (84 m) long, 76 feet (23 m) wide at its transepts, and 121 feet (37 m) high.[208] The exterior is Pennsylvania sandstone, trimmed with Indiana limestone, and the interior is made of limestone and Aquia Creek sandstone.[208] The design evokes characteristics of an English church of the Middle Ages.[208] The extensive iconography, in stained glass, stonework, and wood carvings, has the common theme of connecting religion and scholarship.[204]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nPublished in 2008, the Sustainability Action Plan was the first formal plan for sustainability enacted by the university.[209] It focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conservation of resources, and research, education, and civic engagement for sustainability through 10 year objectives.[210][211] Since the 2008 plan, Princeton has aimed at reducing its carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels without the purchase of market offsets and predicts to meet the goal by 2026 (the former goal was by 2020 but COVID-19 requirements delayed this).[212] Princeton released its second Sustainability Action Plan in 2019 on Earth Day with its main goal being reducing campus greenhouse gases to net zero by 2046 as well as other objectives building on those in the 2008 plan.[211][212] In 2021, the university agreed to divest from thermal coal and tar sand segments of the fossil fuel industry and from companies that are involved in climate disinformation after student protest.[213] Princeton is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[214]\n\n\nPrinceton's Sustainability Action Plan also aims to have zero waste through recycling programs, sustainable purchasing, and behavioral and operational strategies.[215]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance and structure[edit]\n\n\n![An image that shows Christopher Eisgruber signing a paper](image)Christopher Eisgruber, the 20th and current president of the university\nPrinceton's 20th and current president is Christopher Eisgruber, who was appointed by the university's board of trustees in 2013.[130] The board is responsible for the overall direction of the university. It consists of no fewer than 23 and no more than 40 members at any one time, with the president of the university and the Governor of New Jersey serving as ex officio members. It approves the operating and capital budgets, supervises the investment of the university's endowment, and oversees campus real estate and long-range physical planning. The trustees also exercise prior review and approval concerning changes in major policies such as those in instructional programs and admission as well as tuition and fees and the hiring of faculty members.[216]\n\n\nThe university is composed of the Undergraduate College, the Graduate School, the School of Architecture, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the School of Public and International Affairs.[217] Additionally, the school's Bendheim Center for Finance provides education for the area of money and finance in lieu of a business school.[218] Princeton did host a Princeton Law School for a short period, before eventually closing in 1852 due to poor income.[219] Princeton's lack of other professional schools can be attributed to a university focus on undergraduates.[220]\n\n\nThe university has ties with the Institute for Advanced Study,[221] Princeton Theological Seminary, Rutgers University, and the Westminster Choir College of Rider University.[222] Princeton is a member of the Association of American Universities,[223] the Universities Research Association,[224] and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.[225] The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), with its last reaffirmation in 2014.[226]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton University's endowment of $37 billion (per 2021 figures) was ranked as the fourth largest endowment in the United States,[227] and it had the greatest per-student endowment in the world at over $4.4 million per student.[228][229] The endowment is sustained through continued donations and is maintained by investment advisers.[230] Princeton's operating budget is over $2 billion per year, with 50% going to academic departments and programs, 33% to administrative and student service departments, 10% to financial aid departments, and 7% to the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.[231]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Undergraduate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McCosh 50, the largest lecture hall on campus\nPrinceton follows a liberal arts curriculum,[220] and offers two bachelor's degrees to students: a Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.).[217] Typically, A.B. students choose a major (called a concentration) at the end of sophomore year, while B.S.E. students declare at the end of their freshman year.[232] Students must complete distribution requirements, departmental requirements, and independent work to graduate with either degree.[220][217] A.B. students must complete distribution requirements in literature and the arts, science and engineering, social analysis, cultural difference, epistemology and cognition, ethical thought and moral values, historical analysis, and quantitative and computational reasoning; they must also have satisfactory ability in a foreign language.[217] Additionally, they must complete two papers of independent work during their junior year—known as the junior papers—and craft a senior thesis to graduate;[233][234] both revolve around the concentration they are pursuing.[235] B.S.E. majors complete fewer courses in the humanities and social sciences and instead fulfill requirements in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer programming.[217] They likewise must complete independent work, which typically involves a design project or senior thesis, but not the junior papers.[233][235] A.B. majors must complete 31 courses, whereas B.S.E. majors must complete 36 courses.[236]\n\n\nStudents can choose from either 36 concentrations or create their own. They can also participate in 55 interdisciplinary certificate programs;[217] since Princeton does not offer an academic minor, the certificates effectively serve as one.[237] Course structure is determined by the instructor and department. Classes vary in their format, ranging from small seminars to medium-sized lecture courses to large lecture courses.[238] The latter two typically have precepts, which are extra weekly discussion sessions that are led by either the professor or a graduate student.[238][239] The average class meeting time is 3–4 hours a week, although this can vary depending on the course.[238] The student to faculty ratio is 5 to 1,[239] and a majority of classes have fewer than 20 students.[234] In the *Fiske Guide to Colleges*, academic culture is considered as \"tight-knit, extremely hardworking, highly cooperative, and supportive.\"[69]\n\n\nUndergraduates agree to adhere to an academic integrity policy called the Honor Code. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates.[240] The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results in the destruction of all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion.[241] Violations pertaining to all other academic work fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline.[242] Undergraduates are expected to sign a pledge on their written work affirming that they have not plagiarized the work.[243]\n\n\n\n#### Grade deflation policy[edit]\n\n\nThe first focus on issues of grade inflation by the Princeton administration began in 1998 when a university report was released showcasing a steady rise in undergraduate grades from 1973 to 1997.[244][245] Subsequent reports and discussion from the report culminated to when in 2004,[244] Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the dean of the college, implemented a grade deflation policy to address the findings.[246] Malkiel's reason for the policy was that an A was becoming devalued as a larger percentage of the student body received one.[246] Following its introduction, the number of A's and average GPA on campus dropped, although A's and B's were still the most frequent grades awarded.[245][247] The policy received mixed approval from both faculty and students when first instituted.[244][248] Criticism for grade deflation continued through the years, with students alleging negative effects like increased competition and lack of willingness to choose challenging classes.[246][249] Other criticism included job market and graduate school prospects, although Malkiel responded by saying that she sent 3,000 letters to numerous institutions and employers informing them.[245][246] In 2009, transcripts began including a statement about the policy.[250]\n\n\nIn October 2013, Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber created a faculty committee to review the deflation policy.[250] In August 2014, the committee released a report recommending the removal of the policy and instead develop consistent standards for grading across individual departments.[251] In October 2014, following a faculty vote, the numerical targets were removed in response to the report.[252] In a 2020 analysis of undergraduate grades following the removal of a policy, there were no long-lasting effects, with the percent of students receiving A's higher than in 1998.[253]\n\n\n\n### Graduate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Cleveland Tower, part of the Princeton University Graduate College\nFor the 2019–2020 academic year, the Graduate School enrolled 2,971 students. Approximately 40% of the students were female, 42% were international, and 35% of domestic students were a member of a U.S. minority group. The average time to complete a doctoral degree was 5.7 years.[254] The university awarded 318 Ph.D. degrees and 174 final master's degrees for the 2019–2020 academic year.[254]\n\n\nThe Graduate School offers degrees in 42 academic departments and programs, which span the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering.[254][217] Doctoral education is available for all departments while master's degrees are only available in the architecture, engineering, finance, and public policy departments.[255] Doctoral education focuses on original, independent scholarship whereas master's degrees focus more on career preparation in both public life and professional practice. Graduate students can also concentrate in an interdisciplinary program and be granted a certificate. Joint degrees are available for several disciplines, as are dual M.D./Ph.D. or M.P.A./J.D. programs.[217][d]\n\n\nStudents in the graduate school can participate in regional cross-registration agreements, domestic exchanges with other Ivy League schools and similar institutions, and in international partnerships and exchanges.[256]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| Liberal arts |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[257] | 1 |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[258] | 5 |\n| *Forbes*[259] | 1 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[260] | 1 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[261] | 5 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[262] | 1 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[263] | 6 |\n| *QS*[264] | 17 |\n| *THE*[265] | 7 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[266] | 16 |\n\n\nPrinceton ranked first in the 2021 *U.S. News* rankings for the tenth consecutive year.[267][268] Princeton ranked fourth for undergrad teaching for 2021, falling from first place in the 2020 rankings.[268] In the 2022 *Times Higher Education* assessment of the world's best universities, Princeton was ranked 7th.[269] In the 2022 *QS World University Rankings*, it was ranked 20th overall in the world.[270]\n\n\nIn the 2021 *U.S. News & World Report* \"Graduate School Rankings,\" 13 of Princeton's 14 graduate programs were ranked in their respective top 10 (with Engineering 22nd), 7 of them in the top 5, and two in the top spot (Economics and Mathematics).[271]\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal and College Pulse selected Princeton as its top university in its \"2024 Best Colleges in the U.S.\" ranking.[272]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.\"[273] Based on data for the 2020 fiscal year, the university received approximately $250 million in sponsored research for its main campus, with 81.4% coming from the government, 12.1% from foundations, 5.5% from industry, and 1.0% from private and other. An additional $120 million in sponsored research was for the Plasma Physics Lab; the main campus and the lab combined totaled to $370 million for sponsored research.[274] Based on 2017 data, the university ranked 72nd among 902 institutions for research expenditures.[275]\n\n\nBased on 2018 data, Princeton's National Academy Membership totaled to 126, ranking 9th in the nation.[276] The university hosts 75 research institutes and centers and two national laboratories.[277] Princeton is a member of the New Jersey Space Grant Consortium.[278]\n\n\n\n#### Library system[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Firestone Library](image)Firestone Library, the largest of Princeton's librariesThe Princeton University Library system houses over 13 million holdings through 11 buildings,[279] including seven million bound volumes, making it one of the largest university libraries in the country.[14] Built in 1948, the main campus library is Firestone Library and serves as the main repository for the humanities and social sciences.[279] Its collections include the autographed manuscript of F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby*[280] and George F. Kennan's Long Telegram.[281] In addition to Firestone library, specialized libraries exist for architecture, art and archaeology, East Asian studies, engineering, music, public and international affairs, public policy and university archives, and the sciences.[282] The library system provides access to subscription-based electronic resources and databases to students.[283]\n\n\n#### National laboratories[edit]\n\n\nThe Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) stemmed from Project Matterhorn, a top secret cold war project created in 1951 aimed at achieving controlled nuclear fusion.[284] Princeton astrophysics professor Lyman Spitzer became the first director of the project and remained director until the lab's declassification in 1961 when it received its current name.[284] Today, it is an institute for fusion energy research and plasma physics research.[285]\n\n\nFounded in 1955 and located at Princeton's Forrestal Campus since 1968, the NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) conducts climate research and modeling.[286][287] Princeton faculty, research scientists, and graduate scientists can participate in research with the lab.[286]\n\n\n\n## Admissions and financial aid[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2022 enteringclass[288]Change vs.2017[289]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 5.6% (![Neutral decrease](image) −1.6)\n |\n| Yield rate | 69.1% (![Steady](image) −0.7)\n |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT EBRW | 760 |\n| SAT Math | 790 (![Increase](image) +40 median)\n |\n| ACT Composite | 35 (![Increase](image) +2 median)\n |\n| High school GPA |\n| Average | 3.95 (![Increase](image) +0.04)\n |\n|  |\n\nPrinceton offers several methods to apply: the Common Application, the Coalition Application, and the QuestBridge Application.[290][291] Princeton's application requires several writing supplements and submitting a graded written paper.[290]\n\n\nPrinceton's undergraduate program is highly selective, admitting 5.8% of undergraduate applicants in the 2019–2020 admissions cycle (for the Class of 2024).[3] The middle 50% range of SAT scores was 1470–1560, the middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 33–35, and the average high school GPA was a 3.91.[3] For graduate admissions, in the 2021–2022 academic year, Princeton received 12,553 applications for admission and accepted 1,322 applicants, with a yield rate of 51%.[254]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, Princeton used an ABC system to function as a precursory early program, where admission officers would visit feeder schools and assign A, B, or C ratings to students.[292][e] From 1977 to 1995, Princeton employed an early action program, and in 1996, transitioned to an early decision program.[293] In September 2006, the university announced that all applicants for the Class of 2012 would be considered in a single pool, ending the school's early decision program.[294] In February 2011, following decisions by the University of Virginia and Harvard University to reinstate their early admissions programs, Princeton announced it would institute a single-choice early action option for applicants,[293] which it still uses.[290]\n\n\nPrinceton reinstated its transfer students program in 2018 after a three decade moratorium; the program encourages applicants from low-income families, the military, and community colleges.[295][296]\n\n\n\n### Costs and financial aid[edit]\n\n\nAs of the 2021–2022 academic year, the total cost of attendance is $77,690.[297] 61% of all undergraduates receive financial aid, with the average financial aid grant being $57,251.[3] Tuition, room, and board is free for families making up to $65,000, and financial aid is offered to families making up to $180,000.[298] In 2001, expanding on earlier reforms, Princeton became the first university to eliminate the use of student loans in financial aid, replacing them with grants.[126][69] In addition, all admissions are need-blind, and financial aid meets 100% of demonstrated financial need.[299] The university does not use academic or athletic merit scholarships.[300] In September 2022, Princeton announced that it would cover all costs for families earning $100,000 a year or less, with reduced costs for higher income families as well.[301]\n\n\n*Kiplinger* magazine in 2019 ranked Princeton as the fifth best value school in a combined list comparing private universities, private liberal arts colleges, and public colleges, noting that the average graduating debt was $9,005.[302] For its 2021 rankings, the *U.S. News & World Report* ranked it second in its category for \"Best Value Schools.\"[268]\n\n\n\n## Student life and culture[edit]\n\n\n### Residential colleges[edit]\n\n\nThe university guarantees housing for students for all four years,[303] with more than 98% of undergraduates living on campus.[304] Freshman and sophomores are required to live on campus, specifically in one of the university's six residential colleges. Once put into a residential college, students have an upperclassmen residential college adviser to adjust to college life and a faculty academic adviser for academic guidance.[305] Upperclassmen are given the option to keep living in the college or decide to move into upperclassmen dorms;[304] upperclassmen still remain affiliated with their college even if they live somewhere else.[69]\n\n\nEach residential college has its own distinct layout and architecture.[305] Additionally, each college has its own faculty head, dean, director of studies, and director of student life. The colleges feature various amenities, such as dining halls, common rooms, laundry rooms, academic spaces, and arts and entertainment resources. Three of the colleges house students from all classes while the other three house only underclassmen.[306]\n\n\nPrinceton's residential college system dates back to when university president Woodrow Wilson's proposed the creation of quadrangles.[82] While the plan was vetoed,[82] it eventually made a resurgence with the creation of Wilson Lodge (now known as First College) in 1957 to provide an alternative to the eating clubs.[307] Wilson Lodge was dedicated as Wilson College in 1968 and served as an experiment for the residential college system. In 2020, Princeton University elected to change the name of Wilson College to First College after the recent deaths involving police brutality of black individuals.[308] When enrollment increased in the 1970s, a university report in 1979 recommended the establishment of five residential colleges.[309] Funding was raised within a year,[310] leading to the development of Rockefeller College (1982), Mathey College (1983), Butler College (1983), and Forbes College (1984).[307] Whitman College was founded and constructed in 2007 at a cost of $100 million.[311] Butler's dorms were demolished in 2007 and a new complex was built in 2009.[312] Butler and Mathey previously acted as only underclassmen colleges, but transitioned to four-year colleges in fall 2009.[313] Princeton completed and opened two new residential colleges—Yeh College and New College West—at the beginning of the academic year in September 2022.[314][f] The university plans to construct a new residential college named Hobson College where First College currently stands.[316]\n\n\n\nPrinceton has one graduate residential college, known as the Graduate College, located on a hill about half a mile from the main campus.[317][g] The location of the Graduate College was the result of a dispute between Woodrow Wilson and then-Graduate School Dean Andrew Fleming West. Wilson preferred a central location for the college; West wanted the graduate students as far as possible from the campus, and ultimately, he prevailed.[319] The Graduate College is composed of a large Collegiate Gothic section crowned by Cleveland Tower,[317] a memorial tower for former Princeton trustee Grover Cleveland.[320][321] The tower also has 67 carillon bells, making it one of the largest carillons in the world.[322] The attached New Graduate College provides a modern contrast in architectural style to the gothic Old Graduate College.[323] Graduate students also have the option of living in student apartments.[324]\n\n* ![A picture of First College](image)\n\nFirst College (founded 1957)\n* ![A picture of Forbes College](image)\n\nForbes College (founded 1984)\n* ![The exterior of Mathey College, specifically Blair Arch.](image)\n\nMathey College (founded 1983)\n* ![A picture of Rockefeller College](image)\n\nRockefeller College (founded 1982)\n* ![A picture showcasing the entrance to Butler College](image)\n\nButler College (founded 1983)\n* ![The exterior of Whitman College.](image)\n\nWhitman College (founded 2007)\n\n\n### Eating clubs and dining[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Eating clubs at Princeton University\n\n![A picture of Ivy Club, the oldest eating club on campus](image)Founded in 1879, Ivy Club is the oldest and wealthiest eating club on campus\nEach residential college has a dining hall for students in the college, and they vary in their environment and food served.[325][326] Upperclassmen who no longer live in the college can choose from a variety of options: join an eating club and choose a shared meal plan; join a dining co-op, where groups of students eat, prepare, and cook food together; or organize their own dining.[325] The university offers kosher dining through the Center for Jewish Life and halal dining options for Muslim students in the dining halls.[325]\n\n\nSocial life takes place primarily on campus and is involved heavily with one's residential college or eating club.[303][151] Residential colleges host a variety of social events and activities, ranging from Broadway show outings to regular barbecues.[305] Eating clubs, while not affiliated with the university, are co-ed organizations that serve as social centers, host events, and invite guest speakers.[327][69] Additionally, they serve as a place of community for upperclassmen.[327][151] Five of the clubs have first-serve memberships called \"sign-ins\" and six clubs use a selective process, in which students must \"bicker.\"[328] This requires prospective members to undergo an interviewing process.[329] Each eating club has a fee to join which ranges from around $9,000 to $10,000. As a result, Princeton increases financial aid for upperclassmen, and the eating clubs also offer financial assistance.[330][331] Cumulatively, there are ten clubs located on Prospect Avenue—Cannon, Cap and Gown, Charter, Cloister, Colonial, Cottage, Ivy, Quadrangle, Tiger, and Tower—and one located on Washington Road—Terrace.[332][328] 68% of upperclassmen are members of a club, with each one containing around 150 to 200 students[328]\n\n\n\n### Campus organizations[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton hosts around 500 recognized student organizations and several campus centers.[304]\n\n\nThe Undergraduate Student Government (USG) serves as Princeton's student government.[333] The USG funds student organization events, sponsors campus events, and represents the undergraduate student body when convening with faculty and administration.[333]\n\n\n\n![A picture of Whig Hall](image)Whig Hall, where the American Whig-Cliosophic Society resides.\nFounded in about 1765, the American Whig-Cliosophic Society is the nation's oldest collegiate political, literary, and debate society,[334][151] and is the largest and oldest student organization on campus.[335] The Whig-Clio Society has several subsidiary organizations, each specialized to different areas of politics: the Princeton Debate Panel, International Relations Council, Princeton Mock Trial, and Princeton Model Congress.[336] The International Relations Council manages two Model United Nations conferences: the Princeton Diplomatic Invitational (PDI) for collegiate competition and the Princeton Model United Nations Conference (PMUNC) for high school competition.[337]\n\n\nThere are several publications on campus and a radio station. Founded in 1876, *The Daily Princetonian*, otherwise known as *The Prince*, is the second oldest college daily student newspaper in the United States.[338][339] Other publications include *The Nassau Literary Review*,[340] the *Princeton Tory*, a campus journal of conservative thought,[341] *The Princeton Diplomat*, the only student-run magazine on global affairs,[342] the *Princeton Political Review*, the only multi-partisan political publication on campus,[343] and the recently revived *Princeton Progressive*, the only left-leaning political publication on campus,[344][345] among others. Princeton's WPRB (103.3 FM) radio station is the oldest licensed college radio station in the nation.[151]\n\n\n\n![A picture of McCarter Theatre](image)The McCarter Theatre, where the Princeton Triangle Club premiers its Triangle Show.[346]\nPrinceton is home to a variety of performing arts and music groups. Many of the groups are represented by the Performing Arts Council.[347] Dating back to 1883, the Princeton Triangle Club is America's oldest touring musical-comedy theater group.[348][349] It performs its annual Triangle Show every fall at the 1,000 seat McCarter Theatre,[350][346] as well as original musical comedies, revues, and other shows throughout campus.[349] Princeton's oldest choir is the Glee Club, which began in 1874.[351] The comedic scramble Tiger Band was formed in 1919 and plays at halftime shows and other events.[352] Other groups include the Princeton University Orchestra, the flagship symphony orchestra group founded in 1896,[353] and the Princeton Symphony Orchestra,[354] both of which perform at Alexander Hall.[355][353]\n\n\nA cappella groups are a staple of campus life, with many holding concerts, informal shows, and arch sings.[351][356] Arch sings are where a cappella performances are held in one of Princeton's many gothic arches. The oldest a cappella ensemble is the Nassoons, which were formed in 1941. All-male groups include the Tigertones (1946) and Footnotes (1959); all-female groups include the Tigerlilies (1971), Tigressions (1981), Wildcats (1987); the oldest coed a cappella group in the Ivy League is the Princeton Katzenjammers (1973), which was followed by the Roaring 20 (1983) and Shere Khan (1994).[356]\n\n\nPrinceton features several campus centers for students that provide resources and information for students with certain identities. These include the Center for Jewish Life, the Davis International Center, the Carl A. Fields Center for Equality and Cultural Understanding, the Women's Center, and the LGBT Center. The Frist Campus Center and the Campus Club are additional facilities for the entire campus community that hold various activities and events.[304]\n\n\nPrinceton features 15 chaplaincies and multiple religious student groups. The following faiths are represented on campus: Baha'i, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, Sikhism, and Unitarian Universalism.[357]\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton students partake in a wide variety of campus traditions, both past and present.[358] \n\n![A picture of FitzRandolph Gates](image)FitzRandolph Gates, which by tradition undergraduates do not exit until graduation.Current traditions Princeton students celebrate include the ceremonial bonfire, which takes place on the Cannon Green behind Nassau Hall. It is held only if Princeton beats both Harvard University and Yale University at football in the same season.[359] Another tradition is the use of traditional college cheers at events and reunions, like the \"Locomotive\", which dates back to before 1894.[360][361] Princeton students abide by the tradition of never exiting the campus through FitzRandolph Gates until one graduates. According to tradition, anyone who exits campus before their graduation will not graduate.[362][363] A more controversial tradition is Newman's Day, where some students attempt to drink 24 beers in the 24 hours of April 24. According to *The New York Times*, \"the day got its name from an apocryphal quote attributed to Paul Newman: '24 beers in a case, 24 hours in a day. Coincidence? I think not.'\"[364] Newman has spoken out against the tradition.[364] One of the biggest traditions celebrated annually are Reunions, which are massive annual gatherings of alumni.[365] At Reunions, a traditional parade of alumni and their families, known as the \"P-rade\", process through the campus.[366]\n\n\nPrinceton also has several traditions that have faded into the past. One of them was clapper theft, the act of climbing to the top of Nassau Hall to steal the bell clapper, which rings to signal the start of classes on the first day of the school year. For safety reasons, the clapper was permanently removed.[367] Another was the Nude Olympics, an annual nude and partially nude frolic in Holder Courtyard that used to take place during the first snow of the winter. Started in the early 1970s, the Nude Olympics went co-educational in 1979 and gained much notoriety with the American press. Due to issues of sexual harassment and safety reasons, the administration banned the Olympics in 2000 to the disappointment of students.[368][369]\n\n\n\n### Alma mater[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nOld Nassau\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\n\"Old Nassau\" has been Princeton University's school song since 1859, when it was written that year by freshman Harlan Page Peck. It was originally published in the *Nassau Literary Magazine*, where it won the magazine's prize for best college song. After an unsuccessful attempt at singing it to *Auld Lang Syne'*s melody, Karl Langlotz, a Princeton professor, wrote the music for it.[370] In 1987, the university changed the gendered lyrics of \"Old Nassau\" to reflect the school's co-educational student body.[371]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nTiger Transit is the bus system of the university, mostly open to the public and linking university campuses and areas around Princeton.[372] NJ Transit provides bus service on the 600, 606 and 609 lines and rail service on the Dinky, a small commuter train that provides service to the Princeton Junction Station.[373] Coach USA, through their subsidiary Suburban Transit, provides bus service to New York City and other destinations in New Jersey.[373]\n\n\n\n## Student body[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[374] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 36%\n | 36 |\n| Asian | 25%\n | 25 |\n| Foreign national | 12%\n | 12 |\n| Hispanic | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Black | 9%\n | 9 |\n| Other[h] | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[i] | 23%\n | 23 |\n| Affluent[j] | 77%\n | 77 |\n\n\nPrinceton has made significant progress in expanding the diversity of its student body in recent years. The 2021 admitted freshman class was one of the most diverse in the school's history, with 68% of students identifying as students of color.[375] The university has worked to increase its enrollment of first-generation and low-income students in recent years.[376] The median family income of Princeton students is $186,100, with 72% of students coming from the top 20% highest-earning families.[377] In 2017, 22% of freshman qualified for federal Pell Grants, above the 16% average for the top 150 schools ranked by the *U.S. News & World Report*; nationwide, the average was 44%.[378] Based on data in a 2019 article in *The Daily Princetonian,* 10% of students hail from *Bloomberg's* 2018 list of \"100 richest places\", and that the top 20% of high schools send as many students to Princeton as the bottom 80%.[379]\n\n\nIn 1999, 10% of the student body was Jewish, a percentage lower than those at other Ivy League schools. 16% of the student body was Jewish in 1985; the number decreased by 40% from 1985 to 1999. This decline prompted *The Daily Princetonian* to write a series of articles on the decline and its reasons. *The New York Observer* wrote that Princeton was \"long dogged by a reputation for anti-Semitism\" and that this history as well as Princeton's elite status caused the university and its community to feel sensitivity towards the decrease of Jewish students. In the *Observer*, several theories are proposed for the drop, ranging from campus culture to changing admission policies to national patterns.[380] As of 2021, according to the Center for Jewish Life on campus, the university has approximately 700 Jewish students.[381]\n\n\nStarting in 1967, African American enrollment surged from 1.7% to 10% but has stagnated ever since.[382] Bruce M. Wright was admitted into the university in 1936 as the first African American, however, his admission was a mistake and when he got to campus he was asked to leave. Three years later Wright asked the dean for an explanation on his dismissal and the dean suggested to him that \"a member of your race might feel very much alone\" at Princeton University.[383] Princeton would not admit its first Black students until in 1945 when Princeton instituted the V-12 program on campus.[384] In 1947, John L. Howard, one of the four naval cadets admitted to the program, would become the first Black student to graduate with a bachelor's degree.[385][386]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of a tiger statue on Princeton's campus](image)Princeton's mascot is the tiger.\nPrinceton supports organized athletics at three levels: varsity intercollegiate, club intercollegiate, and intramural. It also provides \"a variety of physical education and recreational programs\" for members of the Princeton community.[387] Most undergraduates participate in athletics at some level.[388] Princeton's colors are orange and black.[389] The school's athletes are known as the *Tigers*, and the mascot is a tiger.[389][390] The Princeton administration considered naming the mascot in 2007, but the effort was dropped in the face of alumni opposition.[391]\n\n\n\n### Varsity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Princeton Tigers\n\n![A picture showing a football match between Princeton University and Lehigh University in September 2007](image)Princeton vs. Lehigh football, September 2007\nPrinceton hosts 37 men's and women's varsity sports.[388] Princeton is an NCAA Division I school, with its athletic conference being the Ivy League.[389] Its rowing teams compete in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges, and its men's volleyball team competes in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association.[392] Princeton's sailing team, though a club sport, competes at the varsity level in the MAISA conference of the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association.[393]\n\n\nPrinceton's football team competes in the Football Championship Subdivision of NCAA Division I with the rest of the Ivy League.[394] Princeton played against Rutgers University in the first intercollegiate football game in the U.S. on November 6, 1869; Rutgers won the game.[395] From 1877 until at least 1903, Princeton played football using rugby rules.[396]\n\n\nAs of 2021, Princeton claims 28 national football championships, which would make it the most of any school, although the NCAA only recognizes 15 of the wins.[397][398] With its last win being in 2018, Princeton has won 12 Ivy League championships.[399] In 1951, Dick Kazmaier won Princeton its only Heisman Trophy, the last to come from the Ivy League.[400]\n\n\nThe men's basketball program is noted for its success under Pete Carril, the head coach from 1967 to 1996. During this time, Princeton won 13 Ivy League titles and made 11 NCAA tournament appearances.[401] Carril introduced the Princeton offense, an offensive strategy that has since been adopted by a number of college and professional basketball teams.[401][402] Carril's final victory at Princeton came when the Tigers beat UCLA, the defending national champion, in the opening round of the 1996 NCAA tournament.[401] On December 14, 2005, Princeton tied the record for the fewest points in a Division I game since the institution of the three-point line in 1986–87, when the Tigers scored 21 points in a loss against Monmouth University.[403]\n\n\nPrinceton women's soccer team advanced to the NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Championship semi-finals in 2004, becoming the first Ivy League team to do so in a 64 team setting.[404][405] The men's soccer team was coached from 1984 to 1995 by Princeton alumnus and future United States men's national team manager Bob Bradley, who lead the Tigers to win two Ivy League titles and make an appearance at the NCAA Final Four in 1993.[406] Princeton's men's lacrosse program undertook a period of notable success from 1992 to 2001, during which time it won six national championships.[407] In 2012, its field hockey team became the first in the Ivy League to win a national championship.[408]\n\n\nPrinceton has won at least one Ivy League title every year since 1957, and it became the first university in its conference to win over 500 Ivy League athletic championships.[408] From 1896 to 2018, 113 athletes from Princeton have competed in the Olympics, winning 19 gold medals, 24 silver medals, and 23 bronze medals.[409]\n\n\n\n### Club and intramural[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The annual Cane Spree depicted in 1877\nIn addition to varsity sports, Princeton hosts 37 club sports teams, which are open to all Princeton students of any skill level.[410] Teams compete against other collegiate teams both in the Northeast and nationally.[410] The intramural sports program is also available on campus, which schedules competitions between residential colleges, eating clubs, independent groups, students, and faculty and staff.[304][411] Several leagues with differing levels of competitiveness are available.[412]\n\n\nIn the fall, freshman and sophomores participate in the intramural athletic competition called Cane Spree. Although the event centers on cane wrestling, freshman and sophomores compete in other sports and competitions. This commemorates a time in the 1870s when sophomores, angry with the freshmen who strutted around with fancy canes, stole all of the canes from the freshmen, hitting them with their own canes in the process.[413]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Princeton University people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Princeton University as alumni or faculty.\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain category: Princeton University alumni\n\nU.S. Presidents James Madison and Woodrow Wilson and Vice Presidents George M. Dallas, John Breckinridge, and Aaron Burr graduated from Princeton,[414] as did Michelle Obama, the former First Lady of the United States.[415] Former Chief Justice of the United States Oliver Ellsworth was an alumnus, as are current U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justices Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor.[416] Alumnus Jerome Powell was appointed as Chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board in 2018.[417]\n\n\nPrinceton graduates played a major role in the American Revolution, including the first and last Colonels to die on the Patriot side Philip Johnston[418] and Nathaniel Scudder,[419] as well as the highest ranking civilian leader on the British side David Mathews.[420]\n\n\nNotable graduates of Princeton's School of Engineering and Applied Science include Apollo astronaut and commander of Apollo 12 Pete Conrad,[421] Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos,[422] former Chairman of Alphabet Inc.

Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania both claim the fourth oldest founding date and the University of Pennsylvania once claimed 1749 as its founding date, making it fifth oldest, but in 1899 its trustees adopted a resolution which asserted 1740 as the founding date.[10][11] To further complicate the comparison of founding dates, a Log College was operated by William and Gilbert Tennent, the Presbyterian ministers, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from 1726 until 1746 and it was once common to assert a formal connection between it and the College of New Jersey, which would justify Princeton pushing its founding date back to 1726. However, Princeton has never done so and a Princeton historian says that the facts \"do not warrant\" such an interpretation.[12] Columbia University was chartered and began collegiate classes in 1754. Columbia considers itself to be the fifth institution of higher learning in the United States, based upon its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755.[13]\n2. **^** The strike was part of the broader Student Strike of 1970.\n3. **^** 505 women applied to join the Princeton freshman class.[147]\n4. **^** The M.D./Ph.D. is granted in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and the Rutgers–New Brunswick Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.

Founded in 1746 in Elizabeth as the  **College of New Jersey**, Princeton is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[8][9][a] The institution moved to Newark in 1747, and then to the current site nine years later. It officially became a university in 1896 and was subsequently renamed Princeton University.\n\n\nThe university is governed by the Trustees of Princeton University and has an endowment of $37.7 billion, the largest endowment per student in the United States. Princeton provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering to approximately 8,500 students on its 600 acres (2.4 km2) main campus. It offers postgraduate degrees through the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School of Architecture and the Bendheim Center for Finance. The university also manages the Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and is home to the NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\" and has one of the largest university libraries in the world.[14]\n\n\nPrinceton uses a residential college system and is known for its upperclassmen eating clubs. The university has over 500 student organizations. Princeton students embrace a wide variety of traditions from both the past and present. The university is a NCAA Division I school and competes in the Ivy League. The school's athletic team, the Princeton Tigers, has won the most titles in its conference and has sent many students and alumni to the Olympics.\n\n\nAs of October 2021, 75 Nobel laureates, 16 Fields Medalists and 16 Turing Award laureates have been affiliated with Princeton University as alumni, faculty members, or researchers. In addition, Princeton has been associated with 21 National Medal of Science awardees, 5 Abel Prize awardees, 11 National Humanities Medal recipients, 217 Rhodes Scholars, 137 Marshall Scholars, and\n62 Gates Cambridge Scholars. Two U.S. presidents, twelve U.S. Supreme Court Justices (three of whom currently serve on the court) and numerous living industry and media tycoons and foreign heads of state are all counted among Princeton's alumni body. Princeton has graduated many members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Cabinet, including eight Secretaries of State, three Secretaries of Defense and two Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Princeton University\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![A drawing of the Log College](image)The Log College, an influential aspect of Princeton's development\nPrinceton University, founded as the College of New Jersey, was shaped much in its formative years by the \"Log College\", a seminary founded by the Reverend William Tennent at Neshaminy, Pennsylvania, in about 1726. While no legal connection ever existed, many of the pupils and adherents from the Log College would go on to financially support and become substantially involved in the early years of the university.[12] While early writers considered it as the predecessor of the university,[15] the idea has been rebuked by Princeton historians.[16][12]\n\n\nThe founding of the university itself originated from a split in the Presbyterian church following the Great Awakening.[17] In 1741, New Light Presbyterians were expelled from the Synod of Philadelphia in defense of how the Log College ordained ministers.[18] The four founders of the College of New Jersey, who were New Lights, were either expelled or withdrew from the Synod and devised a plan to establish a new college, for they were disappointed with Harvard and Yale's opposition to the Great Awakening and dissatisfied with the limited instruction at the Log College.[18][17] They convinced three other Presbyterians to join them and decided on New Jersey as the location for the college, as at the time, there was no institution between Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut, and the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia; it was also where some of the founders preached.[19] Although their initial request was rejected by the Anglican governor Lewis Morrison, the acting governor after Morrison's death, John Hamilton, granted a charter for the College of New Jersey on October 22, 1746.[20][19] In 1747, approximately five months after acquiring the charter, the trustees elected Jonathan Dickinson as president and opened in Elizabeth, New Jersey,[20] where classes were held in Dickinson's parsonage.[21] With its founding, it became the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, and one of nine colonial colleges charted before the American Revolution.[8][9] The founders aimed for the college to have an expansive curriculum to teach people of various professions, not solely ministerial work.[22][20] Though the school was open to those of any religious denomination,[23] with many of the founders being of Presbyterian faith, the college became the educational and religious capital of Scotch-Irish Presbyterian America.[24]\n\n\n\n### Colonial and early years[edit]\n\n\n![An engraving of Nassau Hall from 1760](image)From 1760, the first picture of Nassau Hall\nIn 1747, following the death of then President Jonathan Dickinson, the college moved from Elizabeth to Newark, New Jersey, as that was where presidential successor Aaron Burr Sr.'s parsonage was located.[20] That same year, Princeton's first charter came under dispute by Anglicans, but on September 14, 1748, the recently appointed governor Jonathan Belcher granted a second charter.[25][26] Belcher, a Congregationalist, had become alienated from his alma mater, Harvard, and decided to \"adopt\" the infant college.[25][23] Belcher would go on to raise funds for the college and donate his 474-volume library, making it one of the largest libraries in the colonies.[25][27]\n\n\n\nIn 1756, the college moved again to its present home in Princeton, New Jersey, because Newark was felt to be too close to New York.[28][29] Princeton was chosen for its central location in New Jersey and by strong recommendation by Belcher.[25][30] The college's home in Princeton was Nassau Hall, named for the royal William III of England, a member of the House of Orange-Nassau.[31] The trustees of the College of New Jersey initially suggested that Nassau Hall be named in recognition of Belcher because of his interest in the institution; the governor vetoed the request.[25] \n\n![A portrait of John Witherspoon](image)John Witherspoon, President of the college (1768–94) and signer of the Declaration of Independence\nBurr, who would die in 1757, devised a curriculum for the school and enlarged the student body.[32] Following the untimely death of Burr and the college's next three presidents,[33] John Witherspoon became president in 1768 and remained in that post until his death in 1794.[34] With his presidency, Witherspoon focused the college on preparing a new generation of both educated clergy and secular leadership in the new American nation.[35][36] To this end, he tightened academic standards, broadened the curriculum, solicited investment for the college, and grew its size.[37][36]\n\n\nA signer of the Declaration of Independence, Witherspoon and his leadership led the college to becoming influential to the American Revolution.[34][38][39] In 1777, the college became the site for the Battle of Princeton.[34] During the battle, British soldiers briefly occupied Nassau Hall before eventually surrendering to American forces led by General George Washington.[40] During the summer and fall of 1783, the Continental Congress and Washington met in Nassau Hall, making Princeton the country's capital for four months;[41] Nassau Hall is where Congress learned of the peace treaty between the colonies and the British.[42][43] The college did suffer from the revolution, with a depreciated endowment and hefty repair bills for Nassau Hall.[44]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1795, President Samuel Stanhope Smith took office, the first alumnus to become president.[45] Nassau Hall suffered a large fire that destroyed its interior in 1802, which Smith blamed on rebellious students.[46] The college raised funds for reconstruction, as well as the construction of two new buildings.[47] In 1807, a large student riot occurred at Nassau Hall, spurred by underlying distrust of educational reforms by Smith away from the Church.[45][48] Following Smith's mishandling of the situation, falling enrollment, and faculty resignations, the trustees of the university offered resignation to Smith, which he accepted.[47] In 1812, Ashbel Green was unanimously elected by the trustees of the college to become the eighth president.[49] After the liberal tenure of Smith, Green represented the conservative \"Old Side,\" in which he introduced rigorous disciplinary rules and heavily embraced religion.[50][51] Even so, believing the college was not religious enough, he took a prominent role in establishing the Princeton Theological Seminary next door.[50][49] While student riots were a frequent occurrence during Green's tenure, enrollment did increase under his administration.[52]\n\n\n\nIn 1823, James Carnahan became president, arriving as an unprepared and timid leader.[53][54] With the college riven by conflicting views between students, faculty, and trustees, and enrollment hitting its lowest in years, Carnahan considered closing the university.[53] Carnahan's successor, John Maclean Jr., who was only a professor at the time, recommended saving the university with the help of alumni; as a result, Princeton's alumni association, led by James Madison, was created and began raising funds.[53][55] With Carnahan and Maclean, now vice-president, working as partners, enrollment and faculty increased, tensions decreased, and the college campus expanded.[55] Maclean took over the presidency in 1854, and led the university through the American Civil War.[56] When Nassau Hall burned down again in 1855,[57] Maclean raised funds and used the money to rebuild Nassau Hall and run the university on an austerity budget during the war years.[56] With a third of students from the college being from the South, enrollment fell.[58] Once many of the Southerners left, the campus became a sharp proponent for the Union,[59] even bestowing an honorary degree to President Lincoln.[60]\n\n![A portrait of James McCosh](image)James McCosh, President of the college (1868–88)James McCosh became the college's president in 1868, and lifted the institution out of a low period that had been brought about by the war.[61] During his two decades of service, he overhauled the curriculum, oversaw an expansion of inquiry into the sciences, recruited distinguished faculty, and supervised the addition of a number of buildings in the High Victorian Gothic style to the campus.[61][62] McCosh's tenure also saw the creation and rise of many extracurricular activities, like the Princeton Glee Club, the Triangle Club, the first intercollegiate football team, and the first permanent eating club,[63] as well as the elimination of fraternities and sororities.[64] In 1879, Princeton conferred its first doctorates on James F. Williamson and William Libby, both members of the Class of 1877.[65]\n\n\nFrancis Patton took the presidency in 1888, and although his election was not met by unanimous enthusiasm, he was well received by undergraduates.[66] Patton's administration was marked with great change, for Princeton's enrollment and faculty had doubled. At the same time, the college underwent large expansion and social life was changing in reflection of the rise in eating clubs and burgeoning interest in athletics.[67] In 1893, the honor system was established, allowing for unproctored exams.[68][69] In 1896, the college officially became a university,[70] and as a result, it officially changed its name to Princeton University.[71] In 1900, the Graduate School was formally established.[70] Even with such accomplishments, Patton's administration remained lackluster with its administrative structure[72] and towards its educational standards.[68] Due to profile changes in the board of trustees and dissatisfaction with his administration, he was forced to resign in 1902.[72]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![A portrait of Woodrow Wilson as president of Princeton](image)Woodrow Wilson, President of Princeton University (1902–10) and 28th president of the United States\nFollowing Patton's resignation, Woodrow Wilson, an alumnus and popular professor, was elected the 13th president of the university.[73][74] Noticing falling academic standards, Wilson orchestrated significant changes to the curriculum, where freshman and sophomores followed a unified curriculum while juniors and seniors concentrated study in one discipline.[75] Ambitious seniors were allowed to undertake independent work, which would eventually shape Princeton's emphasis on the practice for the future.[76] Wilson further reformed the educational system by introducing the preceptorial system in 1905,[75] a then-unique concept in the United States that augmented the standard lecture method of teaching with a more personal form in which small groups of students, or precepts, could interact with a single instructor, or preceptor, in their field of interest.[77] The changes brought about many new faculty and cemented Princeton's academics for the first half of the 20th century.[78] Due to the tightening of academic standards, enrollment declined severely until 1907.[75] In 1906, the reservoir Lake Carnegie was created by Andrew Carnegie,[79] and the university officially became nonsectarian.[80] Before leaving office, Wilson strengthened the science program to focus on \"pure\" research and broke the Presbyterian lock on the board of trustees.[73][81] However, he did fail in winning support for the permanent location of the Graduate School and the elimination of the eating clubs, which he proposed replacing with quadrangles, a precursor to the residential college system.[82] Wilson also continued to keep Princeton closed off from accepting Black students.[83] When an aspiring Black student wrote a letter to Wilson, he got his secretary to reply telling him to attend a university where he would be more welcome.[84]\n\n\nJohn Grier Hibben became president in 1912, and would remain in the post for two decades.[85] On October 2, 1913, the Princeton University Graduate College was dedicated.[79] When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Hibben allocated all available University resources to the government. As a result, military training schools opened on campus and laboratories and other facilities were used for research and operational programs. Overall, more than 6,000 students served in the armed forces, with 151 dying during the war.[86] After the war, enrollment spiked and the trustees established the system of selective admission in 1922.[87] From the 1920s to the 1930s, the student body featured many students from preparatory schools, zero Black students, and dwindling Jewish enrollment because of quotas.[88] Aside from managing Princeton during WWI, Hibben introduced the senior thesis in 1923 as a part of The New Plan of Study.[89][90] He also brought about great expansion to the university, with the creation of the School of Architecture in 1919, the School of Engineering in 1921, and the School of Public and International Affairs in 1930.[91] By the end of his presidency, the endowment had increased by 374 percent, the total area of the campus doubled, the faculty experienced impressive growth, and the enrollment doubled.[92][90]\n\n\nHibben's successor, Harold Willis Dodds would lead the university through the Great Depression, World War II, and the Korean Conflict.[93] With the Great Depression, many students were forced to withdraw due to financial reasons.[94] At the same time, Princeton's reputation in physics and mathematics surged as many European scientists left for the United States due to uneasy tension caused by Nazi Germany.[95] In 1930, the Institute for Advanced Study was founded to provide a space for the influx of scientists, such as Albert Einstein.[96] Many Princeton scientists would work on the Manhattan Project during the war, [97] including the entire physics department.[98] During World War II, Princeton offered an accelerated program for students to graduate early before entering the armed forces.[99] Student enrollment fluctuated from month to month, and many faculty were forced to teach unfamiliar subjects. Still, Dodds maintained academic standards and would establish a program for servicemen, so they could resume their education once discharged.[100]\n\n\n\n### 1945 to present[edit]\n\n\nPost-war years saw scholars renewing broken bonds through numerous conventions, expansion of the campus, and the introduction of distribution requirements.[101][102] The period saw the desegregation of Princeton, which was stimulated by changes to the New Jersey constitution.[103] Princeton began undertaking a sharper focus towards research in the years after the war, with the construction of Firestone Library in 1948 and the establishment of the Forrestal Research Center in the 1950s.[104] Government sponsored research increased sharply, particularly in the physics and engineering departments,[105] with much of it occurring at the new Forrestal campus.[106] Though, as the years progressed, scientific research at the Forrestal campus declined, and in 1973, some of the land was converted to commercial and residential spaces.[107]\n\n\nRobert Goheen would succeed Dodds by unanimous vote and serve as president until 1972.[108] Goheen's presidency was characterized as being more liberal than previous presidents, and his presidency would see a rise in Black applicants,[109] as well as the eventual coeducation of the university in 1969.[110] During this period of rising diversity, the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center) was dedicated in 1971.[111] Goheen also oversaw great expansion for the university, with square footage increasing by 80 percentage.[112]\n\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Princeton experienced unprecedented activism, with most of it centered on the Vietnam War.[113][114] While Princeton activism initially remained relatively timid compared to other institutions,[113] protests began to grow with the founding of a local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in 1965, which organized many of the later Princeton protests.[113] In 1966, the SDS gained prominence on campus following picketing against a speech by President Lyndon B. Johnson, which gained frontpage coverage by the *New York Times.*[115][116] A notable point of contention on campus was the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) and would feature multiple protests,[113] some of which required police action.[117] As the years went on, the protests' agenda broadened to investments in South Africa, environmental issues, and women's rights.[113][118] In response to these broadening protests, the Council of the Princeton University Community (CPUC) was founded to serve as a method for greater student voice in governance.[119] Activism culminated in 1970 with a student, faculty, and staff member strike, so the university could become an \"institution against expansion of the war.\"[120][b] Princeton's protests would taper off later that year, with *The* *Daily Princetonian* saying that, \"Princeton 1970–71 was an emotionally burned out university.\"\n\n\nIn 1982, the residential college system was officially established under Goheen's successor William G. Bowen, who would serve until 1988.[121][122] During his presidency, Princeton's endowment increased from $625 million to $2 billion, and a major fundraising drive known as \"A Campaign for Princeton\" was conducted.[122] President Harold T. Shapiro would succeed Bowen and remain president until 2001. Shapiro would continue to increase the endowment, expand academic programs, raise student diversity, and oversee the most renovations in Princeton's history.[123] One of Shapiro's initiatives was the formation of the multidisciplinary Princeton Environmental Institute in 1994, renamed the High Meadows Environmental Institute in 2020.[124][125] In 2001, Princeton shifted the financial aid policy to a system that replaced all loans with grants.[126] That same year, Princeton elected its first female president, Shirley M. Tilghman.[127] Before retiring in 2012, Tilghman expanded financial aid offerings and conducted several major construction projects like the Lewis Center for the Arts and a sixth residential college.[128] Tilghman also lead initiatives for more global programs, the creation of an office of sustainability, and investments into the sciences.[129]\n\n\nPrinceton's 20th and current president Christopher Eisgruber was elected in 2013.[130] In 2017, Princeton University unveiled a large-scale public history and digital humanities investigation into its historical involvement with slavery called the Princeton & Slavery Project. The project saw the publication of hundreds of primary sources, 80 scholarly essays, a scholarly conference, a series of short plays, and an art project.[131] In April 2018, university trustees announced that they would name two public spaces for James Collins Johnson and Betsey Stockton, enslaved people who lived and worked on Princeton's campus and whose stories were publicized by the project.[132] In 2019, large-scale student activism again entered the mainstream concerning the school's implementation of federal Title IX policy relating to Campus sexual assault.[133][134] The activism consisted of sit-ins in response to a student's disciplinary sentence.[135]\n\n\n\n### Coeducation[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton explicitly prohibited the admission of women from its founding in 1746 until 1969. Since it lacked an affiliated women's college, it was often referred to as a \"monastery\", both lovingly and derisively, by members of the Princeton community.[136][137]\nFor about a decade, from 1887 to 1897, nearby Evelyn College for Women was largely comprised of daughters of professors and sisters of Princeton undergraduates. While no legal connection existed, many Princeton professors taught there and several Princeton administrations, like Francis Patton, were on its board of trustees. It closed in 1897 following the death of its founder, Joshua McIlvaine.[138]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pyne Hall, where the first female students lived on campus.\nIn 1947, three female members of the library staff enrolled in beginner Russian courses to deal with an increase in Russian literature in the library.[110]\n\n\nIn 1961, Princeton admitted its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meservey,[136] who would go on to be the first woman to earn a master's degree at Princeton.[110] Meservey was, at the time of her admission, already a member of the faculty at Douglass College within Princeton. The dean of the graduate school issued a statement clarifying that Meservey's admission was an exception, and that \"Princeton may permit other women in the future as special cases, but does not plan to make general admissions of women graduate students.\"[139] The student-run *Daily Princetonian* ran four articles about Meservey in one issue,[139][140][141][142] including an editorial lamenting the potential \"far reaching implications\" of Meservey's admission which concluded: \"Princeton is unique as an undergraduate men's college and must remain so.\"[142] Eight more women enrolled the following year in the Graduate School.[136] In 1964, T'sai-ying Cheng became the first woman at Princeton to receive a Ph.D. In 1963, five women came to Princeton for one year to study \"critical languages\" as undergraduates, but were not candidates for a Princeton degree.[110] Following abortive discussions with Sarah Lawrence College to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the university in 1967,[143] the administration commissioned a report on admitting women. The final report was issued in January 1969, supporting the idea.[110] That same month, Princeton's trustees voted 24–8 in favor of coeducation and began preparing the institution for the transition.[144] The university finished these plans in April 1969 and announced there would be coeducation in September.[145] Ultimately, 101 female freshman and 70 female transfer students enrolled at Princeton in September 1969.[146][145][c] Those admitted were housed in Pyne Hall, a fairly isolated dormitory; a security system was added, although the women deliberately broke it within a day.[148]\n\n\nIn 1971, Mary St. John Douglas and Susan Savage Speers became the first female trustees,[110] and in 1974, quotas for men and women were eliminated.[149] Following a 1979 lawsuit, the eating clubs were required to go coeducational in 1991, after an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.[150] In 2001, Princeton elected its first female president.[127]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Washington Road Elm Allée, which is one of the entrances to the campus](image)The eastern side of the Washington Road Elm Allée, one of the entrances to the campus\nThe main campus consists of more than 200 buildings on 600 acres (2.4 km2) in Princeton, New Jersey.[4] The James Forrestal Campus, a smaller location designed mainly as a research and instruction complex, is split between nearby Plainsboro and South Brunswick. The campuses are situated about one hour from both New York City and Philadelphia on the train.[151] The university also owns more than 520 acres (2.1 km2) of property in West Windsor Township,[4] and is where Princeton is planning to construct a graduate student housing complex, which will be known as \"Lake Campus North\".[152]\n\n\nThe first building on campus was Nassau Hall, completed in 1756, and situated on the northern edge of the campus facing Nassau Street.[153] The campus expanded steadily around Nassau Hall during the early and middle 19th century.[154][155] The McCosh presidency (1868–88) saw the construction of a number of buildings in the High Victorian Gothic and Romanesque Revival styles, although many of them are now gone, leaving the remaining few to appear out of place.[156] At the end of the 19th century, much of Princeton's architecture was designed by the Cope and Stewardson firm (led by the same University of Pennsylvania professors of architecture who designed a large part of Washington University in St. Louis and University of Pennsylvania) resulting in the Collegiate Gothic style for which Princeton is known for today.[157] Implemented initially by William Appleton Potter,[157] and later enforced by the university's supervising architect, Ralph Adams Cram,[158] the Collegiate Gothic style remained the standard for all new building on the Princeton campus until 1960.[159][160] A flurry of construction projects in the 1960s produced a number of new buildings on the south side of the main campus, many of which have been poorly received.[161] Several prominent architects have contributed some more recent additions, including Frank Gehry (Lewis Library),[162] I. M. Pei (Spelman Halls),[163] Demetri Porphyrios (Whitman College, a Collegiate Gothic project),[164] Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown (Frist Campus Center, among several others),[165] Minoru Yamasaki (Robertson Hall),[166] and Rafael Viñoly (Carl Icahn Laboratory).[167]\n\n\nA group of 20th-century sculptures scattered throughout the campus forms the Putnam Collection of Sculpture. It includes works by Alexander Calder (*Five Disks: One Empty*), Jacob Epstein (*Albert Einstein*), Henry Moore (*Oval with Points*), Isamu Noguchi (*White Sun*), and Pablo Picasso (*Head of a Woman*).[168] Richard Serra's *The Hedgehog and The Fox* is located between Peyton and Fine halls next to Princeton Stadium and the Lewis Library.[169]\n\n\nAt the southern edge of the campus is Lake Carnegie, an artificial lake named for Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie financed the lake's construction in 1906 at the behest of a friend and his brother who were both Princeton alumni.[170] Carnegie hoped the opportunity to take up rowing would inspire Princeton students to forsake football, which he considered \"not gentlemanly.\"[171] The Shea Rowing Center on the lake's shore continues to serve as the headquarters for Princeton rowing.[172]\n\n\nPrinceton's grounds were designed by Beatrix Farrand between 1912 and 1943. Her contributions were most recently recognized with the naming of a courtyard for her.[173] Subsequent changes to the landscape were introduced by Quennell Rothschild & Partners in 2000. In 2005, Michael Van Valkenburgh was hired as the new consulting landscape architect for Princeton's 2016 Campus Plan.[174] Lynden B. Miller was invited to work with him as Princeton's consulting gardening architect, focusing on the 17 gardens that are distributed throughout the campus.[175]\n\n\n\n### Buildings[edit]\n\n\n#### Nassau Hall[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Nassau Hall, the university's oldest building](image)Nassau Hall, the university's oldest building and former capitol of the United States. Pictured in front is Cannon Green.\nNassau Hall is the oldest building on campus. Begun in 1754 and completed in 1756,[176] it was the first seat of the New Jersey Legislature in 1776,[177] was involved in the Battle of Princeton in 1777,[178] and was the seat of the Congress of the Confederation (and thus capitol of the United States) from June 30, 1783, to November 4, 1783.[179] Since 1911, the front entrance has been flanked by two bronze tigers, a gift of the Princeton Class of 1879, which replaced two lions previously given in 1889.[180] Starting in 1922, commencement has been held on the front lawn of Nassau Hall when there is good weather.[181] In 1966, Nassau Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[182] Nowadays, it houses the office of the university president and other administrative offices.[183][184]\n\n\nTo the south of Nassau Hall lies a courtyard that is known as Cannon Green.[185] Buried in the ground at the center is the \"Big Cannon,\" which was left in Princeton by British troops as they fled following the Battle of Princeton. It remained in Princeton until the War of 1812, when it was taken to New Brunswick.[186] In 1836, the cannon was returned to Princeton and placed at the eastern end of town. Two years later, it was moved to the campus under cover of night by Princeton students, and in 1840, it was buried in its current location.[187] A second \"Little Cannon\" is buried in the lawn in front of nearby Whig Hall. The cannon, which may also have been captured in the Battle of Princeton, was stolen by students of Rutgers University in 1875. The theft ignited the Rutgers-Princeton Cannon War. A compromise between the presidents of Princeton and Rutgers ended the war and forced the return of the Little Cannon to Princeton.[187] The protruding cannons are occasionally painted scarlet by Rutgers students who continue the traditional dispute.[188][189]\n\n\n\n#### Art Museum[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Princeton University Art Museum](image)The Princeton University Art Museum, which holds over 112,000 objects\nThough art collection at the university dates back to its very founding, the Princeton University Art Museum was not officially established until 1882 by President McCosh. Its establishment arose from a desire to provide direct access to works of art in a museum for a curriculum in the arts, an education system familiar to many European universities at the time. The museum took on the purposes of providing \"exposure to original works of art and to teach the history of art through an encyclopedic collection of world art.\"[190]\n\n\nNumbering over 112,000 objects, the collections range from ancient to contemporary art and come from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.[191] The museum's art is divided into ten extensive curatorial areas.[192] There is a collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, including ceramics, marbles, bronzes, and Roman mosaics from faculty excavations in Antioch, as well as other art from the ancient Egyptian, Byzantium, and Islamic worlds.[193] The non-Islamic coins were catalogued by Dorothy B. Waage.[194] Medieval Europe is represented by sculpture, metalwork, and stained glass. The collection of Western European paintings includes examples from the early Renaissance through the 19th century, with pieces by Monet, Cézanne, and Van Gogh,[195] and features a growing collection of 20th-century and contemporary art, including paintings such as Andy Warhol's Blue Marilyn.[196]\n\n\nThe museum features a collection of Chinese and Japanese art, with holdings in bronzes, tomb figurines, painting, and calligraphy, as well as collections of Korean, Southeast, and Central Asian art.[197] Its collection of pre-Columbian art includes examples of Mayan and Olmec art, and its indigenous art ranges from Chile to Alaska to Greenland.[198] The museum has collections of old master prints and drawings,[199] and it has a comprehensive collection of over 20,000 photographs.[200] Approximately 750 works of African art are represented.[201] The Museum oversees the outside John B. Putnam, Jr., Memorial Collection of Sculpture.[202]\n\n\n\n#### University Chapel[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of the Princeton University Chapel](image)Finished in 1928, the Princeton University Chapel seats 2,000 people.\nThe Princeton University Chapel is located on the north side of campus near Nassau Street. It was built between 1924 and 1928 at a cost of $2.3 million,[203] approximately $40.8 million adjusted for inflation in 2020. Ralph Adams Cram, the university's supervising architect, designed the chapel, which he viewed as the crown jewel for the Collegiate Gothic motif he had championed for the campus.[204] At the time of its construction, it was the second largest university chapel in the world, after King's College Chapel, Cambridge.[205] It underwent a two-year, $10 million restoration campaign between 2000 and 2002.[206] The Chapel seats around 2,000 and serves as a site for religious services and local celebrations.[207]\n\n\nMeasured on the exterior, the chapel is 277 feet (84 m) long, 76 feet (23 m) wide at its transepts, and 121 feet (37 m) high.[208] The exterior is Pennsylvania sandstone, trimmed with Indiana limestone, and the interior is made of limestone and Aquia Creek sandstone.[208] The design evokes characteristics of an English church of the Middle Ages.[208] The extensive iconography, in stained glass, stonework, and wood carvings, has the common theme of connecting religion and scholarship.[204]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nPublished in 2008, the Sustainability Action Plan was the first formal plan for sustainability enacted by the university.[209] It focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conservation of resources, and research, education, and civic engagement for sustainability through 10 year objectives.[210][211] Since the 2008 plan, Princeton has aimed at reducing its carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels without the purchase of market offsets and predicts to meet the goal by 2026 (the former goal was by 2020 but COVID-19 requirements delayed this).[212] Princeton released its second Sustainability Action Plan in 2019 on Earth Day with its main goal being reducing campus greenhouse gases to net zero by 2046 as well as other objectives building on those in the 2008 plan.[211][212] In 2021, the university agreed to divest from thermal coal and tar sand segments of the fossil fuel industry and from companies that are involved in climate disinformation after student protest.[213] Princeton is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[214]\n\n\nPrinceton's Sustainability Action Plan also aims to have zero waste through recycling programs, sustainable purchasing, and behavioral and operational strategies.[215]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance and structure[edit]\n\n\n![An image that shows Christopher Eisgruber signing a paper](image)Christopher Eisgruber, the 20th and current president of the university\nPrinceton's 20th and current president is Christopher Eisgruber, who was appointed by the university's board of trustees in 2013.[130] The board is responsible for the overall direction of the university. It consists of no fewer than 23 and no more than 40 members at any one time, with the president of the university and the Governor of New Jersey serving as ex officio members. It approves the operating and capital budgets, supervises the investment of the university's endowment, and oversees campus real estate and long-range physical planning. The trustees also exercise prior review and approval concerning changes in major policies such as those in instructional programs and admission as well as tuition and fees and the hiring of faculty members.[216]\n\n\nThe university is composed of the Undergraduate College, the Graduate School, the School of Architecture, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the School of Public and International Affairs.[217] Additionally, the school's Bendheim Center for Finance provides education for the area of money and finance in lieu of a business school.[218] Princeton did host a Princeton Law School for a short period, before eventually closing in 1852 due to poor income.[219] Princeton's lack of other professional schools can be attributed to a university focus on undergraduates.[220]\n\n\nThe university has ties with the Institute for Advanced Study,[221] Princeton Theological Seminary, Rutgers University, and the Westminster Choir College of Rider University.[222] Princeton is a member of the Association of American Universities,[223] the Universities Research Association,[224] and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.[225] The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), with its last reaffirmation in 2014.[226]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton University's endowment of $37 billion (per 2021 figures) was ranked as the fourth largest endowment in the United States,[227] and it had the greatest per-student endowment in the world at over $4.4 million per student.[228][229] The endowment is sustained through continued donations and is maintained by investment advisers.[230] Princeton's operating budget is over $2 billion per year, with 50% going to academic departments and programs, 33% to administrative and student service departments, 10% to financial aid departments, and 7% to the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.[231]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Undergraduate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McCosh 50, the largest lecture hall on campus\nPrinceton follows a liberal arts curriculum,[220] and offers two bachelor's degrees to students: a Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.).[217] Typically, A.B. students choose a major (called a concentration) at the end of sophomore year, while B.S.E. students declare at the end of their freshman year.[232] Students must complete distribution requirements, departmental requirements, and independent work to graduate with either degree.[220][217] A.B. students must complete distribution requirements in literature and the arts, science and engineering, social analysis, cultural difference, epistemology and cognition, ethical thought and moral values, historical analysis, and quantitative and computational reasoning; they must also have satisfactory ability in a foreign language.[217] Additionally, they must complete two papers of independent work during their junior year—known as the junior papers—and craft a senior thesis to graduate;[233][234] both revolve around the concentration they are pursuing.[235] B.S.E. majors complete fewer courses in the humanities and social sciences and instead fulfill requirements in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer programming.[217] They likewise must complete independent work, which typically involves a design project or senior thesis, but not the junior papers.[233][235] A.B. majors must complete 31 courses, whereas B.S.E. majors must complete 36 courses.[236]\n\n\nStudents can choose from either 36 concentrations or create their own. They can also participate in 55 interdisciplinary certificate programs;[217] since Princeton does not offer an academic minor, the certificates effectively serve as one.[237] Course structure is determined by the instructor and department. Classes vary in their format, ranging from small seminars to medium-sized lecture courses to large lecture courses.[238] The latter two typically have precepts, which are extra weekly discussion sessions that are led by either the professor or a graduate student.[238][239] The average class meeting time is 3–4 hours a week, although this can vary depending on the course.[238] The student to faculty ratio is 5 to 1,[239] and a majority of classes have fewer than 20 students.[234] In the *Fiske Guide to Colleges*, academic culture is considered as \"tight-knit, extremely hardworking, highly cooperative, and supportive.\"[69]\n\n\nUndergraduates agree to adhere to an academic integrity policy called the Honor Code. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates.[240] The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results in the destruction of all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion.[241] Violations pertaining to all other academic work fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline.[242] Undergraduates are expected to sign a pledge on their written work affirming that they have not plagiarized the work.[243]\n\n\n\n#### Grade deflation policy[edit]\n\n\nThe first focus on issues of grade inflation by the Princeton administration began in 1998 when a university report was released showcasing a steady rise in undergraduate grades from 1973 to 1997.[244][245] Subsequent reports and discussion from the report culminated to when in 2004,[244] Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the dean of the college, implemented a grade deflation policy to address the findings.[246] Malkiel's reason for the policy was that an A was becoming devalued as a larger percentage of the student body received one.[246] Following its introduction, the number of A's and average GPA on campus dropped, although A's and B's were still the most frequent grades awarded.[245][247] The policy received mixed approval from both faculty and students when first instituted.[244][248] Criticism for grade deflation continued through the years, with students alleging negative effects like increased competition and lack of willingness to choose challenging classes.[246][249] Other criticism included job market and graduate school prospects, although Malkiel responded by saying that she sent 3,000 letters to numerous institutions and employers informing them.[245][246] In 2009, transcripts began including a statement about the policy.[250]\n\n\nIn October 2013, Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber created a faculty committee to review the deflation policy.[250] In August 2014, the committee released a report recommending the removal of the policy and instead develop consistent standards for grading across individual departments.[251] In October 2014, following a faculty vote, the numerical targets were removed in response to the report.[252] In a 2020 analysis of undergraduate grades following the removal of a policy, there were no long-lasting effects, with the percent of students receiving A's higher than in 1998.[253]\n\n\n\n### Graduate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Cleveland Tower, part of the Princeton University Graduate College\nFor the 2019–2020 academic year, the Graduate School enrolled 2,971 students. Approximately 40% of the students were female, 42% were international, and 35% of domestic students were a member of a U.S. minority group. The average time to complete a doctoral degree was 5.7 years.[254] The university awarded 318 Ph.D. degrees and 174 final master's degrees for the 2019–2020 academic year.[254]\n\n\nThe Graduate School offers degrees in 42 academic departments and programs, which span the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering.[254][217] Doctoral education is available for all departments while master's degrees are only available in the architecture, engineering, finance, and public policy departments.[255] Doctoral education focuses on original, independent scholarship whereas master's degrees focus more on career preparation in both public life and professional practice. Graduate students can also concentrate in an interdisciplinary program and be granted a certificate. Joint degrees are available for several disciplines, as are dual M.D./Ph.D. or M.P.A./J.D. programs.[217][d]\n\n\nStudents in the graduate school can participate in regional cross-registration agreements, domestic exchanges with other Ivy League schools and similar institutions, and in international partnerships and exchanges.[256]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| Liberal arts |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[257] | 1 |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[258] | 5 |\n| *Forbes*[259] | 1 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[260] | 1 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[261] | 5 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[262] | 1 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[263] | 6 |\n| *QS*[264] | 17 |\n| *THE*[265] | 7 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[266] | 16 |\n\n\nPrinceton ranked first in the 2021 *U.S. News* rankings for the tenth consecutive year.[267][268] Princeton ranked fourth for undergrad teaching for 2021, falling from first place in the 2020 rankings.[268] In the 2022 *Times Higher Education* assessment of the world's best universities, Princeton was ranked 7th.[269] In the 2022 *QS World University Rankings*, it was ranked 20th overall in the world.[270]\n\n\nIn the 2021 *U.S. News & World Report* \"Graduate School Rankings,\" 13 of Princeton's 14 graduate programs were ranked in their respective top 10 (with Engineering 22nd), 7 of them in the top 5, and two in the top spot (Economics and Mathematics).[271]\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal and College Pulse selected Princeton as its top university in its \"2024 Best Colleges in the U.S.\" ranking.[272]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.\"[273] Based on data for the 2020 fiscal year, the university received approximately $250 million in sponsored research for its main campus, with 81.4% coming from the government, 12.1% from foundations, 5.5% from industry, and 1.0% from private and other. An additional $120 million in sponsored research was for the Plasma Physics Lab; the main campus and the lab combined totaled to $370 million for sponsored research.[274] Based on 2017 data, the university ranked 72nd among 902 institutions for research expenditures.[275]\n\n\nBased on 2018 data, Princeton's National Academy Membership totaled to 126, ranking 9th in the nation.[276] The university hosts 75 research institutes and centers and two national laboratories.[277] Princeton is a member of the New Jersey Space Grant Consortium.[278]\n\n\n\n#### Library system[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Firestone Library](image)Firestone Library, the largest of Princeton's librariesThe Princeton University Library system houses over 13 million holdings through 11 buildings,[279] including seven million bound volumes, making it one of the largest university libraries in the country.[14] Built in 1948, the main campus library is Firestone Library and serves as the main repository for the humanities and social sciences.[279] Its collections include the autographed manuscript of F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby*[280] and George F. Kennan's Long Telegram.[281] In addition to Firestone library, specialized libraries exist for architecture, art and archaeology, East Asian studies, engineering, music, public and international affairs, public policy and university archives, and the sciences.[282] The library system provides access to subscription-based electronic resources and databases to students.[283]\n\n\n#### National laboratories[edit]\n\n\nThe Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) stemmed from Project Matterhorn, a top secret cold war project created in 1951 aimed at achieving controlled nuclear fusion.[284] Princeton astrophysics professor Lyman Spitzer became the first director of the project and remained director until the lab's declassification in 1961 when it received its current name.[284] Today, it is an institute for fusion energy research and plasma physics research.[285]\n\n\nFounded in 1955 and located at Princeton's Forrestal Campus since 1968, the NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) conducts climate research and modeling.[286][287] Princeton faculty, research scientists, and graduate scientists can participate in research with the lab.[286]\n\n\n\n## Admissions and financial aid[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2022 enteringclass[288]Change vs.2017[289]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 5.6% (![Neutral decrease](image) −1.6)\n |\n| Yield rate | 69.1% (![Steady](image) −0.7)\n |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT EBRW | 760 |\n| SAT Math | 790 (![Increase](image) +40 median)\n |\n| ACT Composite | 35 (![Increase](image) +2 median)\n |\n| High school GPA |\n| Average | 3.95 (![Increase](image) +0.04)\n |\n|  |\n\nPrinceton offers several methods to apply: the Common Application, the Coalition Application, and the QuestBridge Application.[290][291] Princeton's application requires several writing supplements and submitting a graded written paper.[290]\n\n\nPrinceton's undergraduate program is highly selective, admitting 5.8% of undergraduate applicants in the 2019–2020 admissions cycle (for the Class of 2024).[3] The middle 50% range of SAT scores was 1470–1560, the middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 33–35, and the average high school GPA was a 3.91.[3] For graduate admissions, in the 2021–2022 academic year, Princeton received 12,553 applications for admission and accepted 1,322 applicants, with a yield rate of 51%.[254]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, Princeton used an ABC system to function as a precursory early program, where admission officers would visit feeder schools and assign A, B, or C ratings to students.[292][e] From 1977 to 1995, Princeton employed an early action program, and in 1996, transitioned to an early decision program.[293] In September 2006, the university announced that all applicants for the Class of 2012 would be considered in a single pool, ending the school's early decision program.[294] In February 2011, following decisions by the University of Virginia and Harvard University to reinstate their early admissions programs, Princeton announced it would institute a single-choice early action option for applicants,[293] which it still uses.[290]\n\n\nPrinceton reinstated its transfer students program in 2018 after a three decade moratorium; the program encourages applicants from low-income families, the military, and community colleges.[295][296]\n\n\n\n### Costs and financial aid[edit]\n\n\nAs of the 2021–2022 academic year, the total cost of attendance is $77,690.[297] 61% of all undergraduates receive financial aid, with the average financial aid grant being $57,251.[3] Tuition, room, and board is free for families making up to $65,000, and financial aid is offered to families making up to $180,000.[298] In 2001, expanding on earlier reforms, Princeton became the first university to eliminate the use of student loans in financial aid, replacing them with grants.[126][69] In addition, all admissions are need-blind, and financial aid meets 100% of demonstrated financial need.[299] The university does not use academic or athletic merit scholarships.[300] In September 2022, Princeton announced that it would cover all costs for families earning $100,000 a year or less, with reduced costs for higher income families as well.[301]\n\n\n*Kiplinger* magazine in 2019 ranked Princeton as the fifth best value school in a combined list comparing private universities, private liberal arts colleges, and public colleges, noting that the average graduating debt was $9,005.[302] For its 2021 rankings, the *U.S. News & World Report* ranked it second in its category for \"Best Value Schools.\"[268]\n\n\n\n## Student life and culture[edit]\n\n\n### Residential colleges[edit]\n\n\nThe university guarantees housing for students for all four years,[303] with more than 98% of undergraduates living on campus.[304] Freshman and sophomores are required to live on campus, specifically in one of the university's six residential colleges. Once put into a residential college, students have an upperclassmen residential college adviser to adjust to college life and a faculty academic adviser for academic guidance.[305] Upperclassmen are given the option to keep living in the college or decide to move into upperclassmen dorms;[304] upperclassmen still remain affiliated with their college even if they live somewhere else.[69]\n\n\nEach residential college has its own distinct layout and architecture.[305] Additionally, each college has its own faculty head, dean, director of studies, and director of student life. The colleges feature various amenities, such as dining halls, common rooms, laundry rooms, academic spaces, and arts and entertainment resources. Three of the colleges house students from all classes while the other three house only underclassmen.[306]\n\n\nPrinceton's residential college system dates back to when university president Woodrow Wilson's proposed the creation of quadrangles.[82] While the plan was vetoed,[82] it eventually made a resurgence with the creation of Wilson Lodge (now known as First College) in 1957 to provide an alternative to the eating clubs.[307] Wilson Lodge was dedicated as Wilson College in 1968 and served as an experiment for the residential college system. In 2020, Princeton University elected to change the name of Wilson College to First College after the recent deaths involving police brutality of black individuals.[308] When enrollment increased in the 1970s, a university report in 1979 recommended the establishment of five residential colleges.[309] Funding was raised within a year,[310] leading to the development of Rockefeller College (1982), Mathey College (1983), Butler College (1983), and Forbes College (1984).[307] Whitman College was founded and constructed in 2007 at a cost of $100 million.[311] Butler's dorms were demolished in 2007 and a new complex was built in 2009.[312] Butler and Mathey previously acted as only underclassmen colleges, but transitioned to four-year colleges in fall 2009.[313] Princeton completed and opened two new residential colleges—Yeh College and New College West—at the beginning of the academic year in September 2022.[314][f] The university plans to construct a new residential college named Hobson College where First College currently stands.[316]\n\n\n\nPrinceton has one graduate residential college, known as the Graduate College, located on a hill about half a mile from the main campus.[317][g] The location of the Graduate College was the result of a dispute between Woodrow Wilson and then-Graduate School Dean Andrew Fleming West. Wilson preferred a central location for the college; West wanted the graduate students as far as possible from the campus, and ultimately, he prevailed.[319] The Graduate College is composed of a large Collegiate Gothic section crowned by Cleveland Tower,[317] a memorial tower for former Princeton trustee Grover Cleveland.[320][321] The tower also has 67 carillon bells, making it one of the largest carillons in the world.[322] The attached New Graduate College provides a modern contrast in architectural style to the gothic Old Graduate College.[323] Graduate students also have the option of living in student apartments.[324]\n\n* ![A picture of First College](image)\n\nFirst College (founded 1957)\n* ![A picture of Forbes College](image)\n\nForbes College (founded 1984)\n* ![The exterior of Mathey College, specifically Blair Arch.](image)\n\nMathey College (founded 1983)\n* ![A picture of Rockefeller College](image)\n\nRockefeller College (founded 1982)\n* ![A picture showcasing the entrance to Butler College](image)\n\nButler College (founded 1983)\n* ![The exterior of Whitman College.](image)\n\nWhitman College (founded 2007)\n\n\n### Eating clubs and dining[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Eating clubs at Princeton University\n\n![A picture of Ivy Club, the oldest eating club on campus](image)Founded in 1879, Ivy Club is the oldest and wealthiest eating club on campus\nEach residential college has a dining hall for students in the college, and they vary in their environment and food served.[325][326] Upperclassmen who no longer live in the college can choose from a variety of options: join an eating club and choose a shared meal plan; join a dining co-op, where groups of students eat, prepare, and cook food together; or organize their own dining.[325] The university offers kosher dining through the Center for Jewish Life and halal dining options for Muslim students in the dining halls.[325]\n\n\nSocial life takes place primarily on campus and is involved heavily with one's residential college or eating club.[303][151] Residential colleges host a variety of social events and activities, ranging from Broadway show outings to regular barbecues.[305] Eating clubs, while not affiliated with the university, are co-ed organizations that serve as social centers, host events, and invite guest speakers.[327][69] Additionally, they serve as a place of community for upperclassmen.[327][151] Five of the clubs have first-serve memberships called \"sign-ins\" and six clubs use a selective process, in which students must \"bicker.\"[328] This requires prospective members to undergo an interviewing process.[329] Each eating club has a fee to join which ranges from around $9,000 to $10,000. As a result, Princeton increases financial aid for upperclassmen, and the eating clubs also offer financial assistance.[330][331] Cumulatively, there are ten clubs located on Prospect Avenue—Cannon, Cap and Gown, Charter, Cloister, Colonial, Cottage, Ivy, Quadrangle, Tiger, and Tower—and one located on Washington Road—Terrace.[332][328] 68% of upperclassmen are members of a club, with each one containing around 150 to 200 students[328]\n\n\n\n### Campus organizations[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton hosts around 500 recognized student organizations and several campus centers.[304]\n\n\nThe Undergraduate Student Government (USG) serves as Princeton's student government.[333] The USG funds student organization events, sponsors campus events, and represents the undergraduate student body when convening with faculty and administration.[333]\n\n\n\n![A picture of Whig Hall](image)Whig Hall, where the American Whig-Cliosophic Society resides.\nFounded in about 1765, the American Whig-Cliosophic Society is the nation's oldest collegiate political, literary, and debate society,[334][151] and is the largest and oldest student organization on campus.[335] The Whig-Clio Society has several subsidiary organizations, each specialized to different areas of politics: the Princeton Debate Panel, International Relations Council, Princeton Mock Trial, and Princeton Model Congress.[336] The International Relations Council manages two Model United Nations conferences: the Princeton Diplomatic Invitational (PDI) for collegiate competition and the Princeton Model United Nations Conference (PMUNC) for high school competition.[337]\n\n\nThere are several publications on campus and a radio station. Founded in 1876, *The Daily Princetonian*, otherwise known as *The Prince*, is the second oldest college daily student newspaper in the United States.[338][339] Other publications include *The Nassau Literary Review*,[340] the *Princeton Tory*, a campus journal of conservative thought,[341] *The Princeton Diplomat*, the only student-run magazine on global affairs,[342] the *Princeton Political Review*, the only multi-partisan political publication on campus,[343] and the recently revived *Princeton Progressive*, the only left-leaning political publication on campus,[344][345] among others. Princeton's WPRB (103.3 FM) radio station is the oldest licensed college radio station in the nation.[151]\n\n\n\n![A picture of McCarter Theatre](image)The McCarter Theatre, where the Princeton Triangle Club premiers its Triangle Show.[346]\nPrinceton is home to a variety of performing arts and music groups. Many of the groups are represented by the Performing Arts Council.[347] Dating back to 1883, the Princeton Triangle Club is America's oldest touring musical-comedy theater group.[348][349] It performs its annual Triangle Show every fall at the 1,000 seat McCarter Theatre,[350][346] as well as original musical comedies, revues, and other shows throughout campus.[349] Princeton's oldest choir is the Glee Club, which began in 1874.[351] The comedic scramble Tiger Band was formed in 1919 and plays at halftime shows and other events.[352] Other groups include the Princeton University Orchestra, the flagship symphony orchestra group founded in 1896,[353] and the Princeton Symphony Orchestra,[354] both of which perform at Alexander Hall.[355][353]\n\n\nA cappella groups are a staple of campus life, with many holding concerts, informal shows, and arch sings.[351][356] Arch sings are where a cappella performances are held in one of Princeton's many gothic arches. The oldest a cappella ensemble is the Nassoons, which were formed in 1941. All-male groups include the Tigertones (1946) and Footnotes (1959); all-female groups include the Tigerlilies (1971), Tigressions (1981), Wildcats (1987); the oldest coed a cappella group in the Ivy League is the Princeton Katzenjammers (1973), which was followed by the Roaring 20 (1983) and Shere Khan (1994).[356]\n\n\nPrinceton features several campus centers for students that provide resources and information for students with certain identities. These include the Center for Jewish Life, the Davis International Center, the Carl A. Fields Center for Equality and Cultural Understanding, the Women's Center, and the LGBT Center. The Frist Campus Center and the Campus Club are additional facilities for the entire campus community that hold various activities and events.[304]\n\n\nPrinceton features 15 chaplaincies and multiple religious student groups. The following faiths are represented on campus: Baha'i, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, Sikhism, and Unitarian Universalism.[357]\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton students partake in a wide variety of campus traditions, both past and present.[358] \n\n![A picture of FitzRandolph Gates](image)FitzRandolph Gates, which by tradition undergraduates do not exit until graduation.Current traditions Princeton students celebrate include the ceremonial bonfire, which takes place on the Cannon Green behind Nassau Hall. It is held only if Princeton beats both Harvard University and Yale University at football in the same season.[359] Another tradition is the use of traditional college cheers at events and reunions, like the \"Locomotive\", which dates back to before 1894.[360][361] Princeton students abide by the tradition of never exiting the campus through FitzRandolph Gates until one graduates. According to tradition, anyone who exits campus before their graduation will not graduate.[362][363] A more controversial tradition is Newman's Day, where some students attempt to drink 24 beers in the 24 hours of April 24. According to *The New York Times*, \"the day got its name from an apocryphal quote attributed to Paul Newman: '24 beers in a case, 24 hours in a day. Coincidence? I think not.'\"[364] Newman has spoken out against the tradition.[364] One of the biggest traditions celebrated annually are Reunions, which are massive annual gatherings of alumni.[365] At Reunions, a traditional parade of alumni and their families, known as the \"P-rade\", process through the campus.[366]\n\n\nPrinceton also has several traditions that have faded into the past. One of them was clapper theft, the act of climbing to the top of Nassau Hall to steal the bell clapper, which rings to signal the start of classes on the first day of the school year. For safety reasons, the clapper was permanently removed.[367] Another was the Nude Olympics, an annual nude and partially nude frolic in Holder Courtyard that used to take place during the first snow of the winter. Started in the early 1970s, the Nude Olympics went co-educational in 1979 and gained much notoriety with the American press. Due to issues of sexual harassment and safety reasons, the administration banned the Olympics in 2000 to the disappointment of students.[368][369]\n\n\n\n### Alma mater[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nOld Nassau\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\n\"Old Nassau\" has been Princeton University's school song since 1859, when it was written that year by freshman Harlan Page Peck. It was originally published in the *Nassau Literary Magazine*, where it won the magazine's prize for best college song. After an unsuccessful attempt at singing it to *Auld Lang Syne'*s melody, Karl Langlotz, a Princeton professor, wrote the music for it.[370] In 1987, the university changed the gendered lyrics of \"Old Nassau\" to reflect the school's co-educational student body.[371]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nTiger Transit is the bus system of the university, mostly open to the public and linking university campuses and areas around Princeton.[372] NJ Transit provides bus service on the 600, 606 and 609 lines and rail service on the Dinky, a small commuter train that provides service to the Princeton Junction Station.[373] Coach USA, through their subsidiary Suburban Transit, provides bus service to New York City and other destinations in New Jersey.[373]\n\n\n\n## Student body[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[374] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 36%\n | 36 |\n| Asian | 25%\n | 25 |\n| Foreign national | 12%\n | 12 |\n| Hispanic | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Black | 9%\n | 9 |\n| Other[h] | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[i] | 23%\n | 23 |\n| Affluent[j] | 77%\n | 77 |\n\n\nPrinceton has made significant progress in expanding the diversity of its student body in recent years. The 2021 admitted freshman class was one of the most diverse in the school's history, with 68% of students identifying as students of color.[375] The university has worked to increase its enrollment of first-generation and low-income students in recent years.[376] The median family income of Princeton students is $186,100, with 72% of students coming from the top 20% highest-earning families.[377] In 2017, 22% of freshman qualified for federal Pell Grants, above the 16% average for the top 150 schools ranked by the *U.S. News & World Report*; nationwide, the average was 44%.[378] Based on data in a 2019 article in *The Daily Princetonian,* 10% of students hail from *Bloomberg's* 2018 list of \"100 richest places\", and that the top 20% of high schools send as many students to Princeton as the bottom 80%.[379]\n\n\nIn 1999, 10% of the student body was Jewish, a percentage lower than those at other Ivy League schools. 16% of the student body was Jewish in 1985; the number decreased by 40% from 1985 to 1999. This decline prompted *The Daily Princetonian* to write a series of articles on the decline and its reasons. *The New York Observer* wrote that Princeton was \"long dogged by a reputation for anti-Semitism\" and that this history as well as Princeton's elite status caused the university and its community to feel sensitivity towards the decrease of Jewish students. In the *Observer*, several theories are proposed for the drop, ranging from campus culture to changing admission policies to national patterns.[380] As of 2021, according to the Center for Jewish Life on campus, the university has approximately 700 Jewish students.[381]\n\n\nStarting in 1967, African American enrollment surged from 1.7% to 10% but has stagnated ever since.[382] Bruce M. Wright was admitted into the university in 1936 as the first African American, however, his admission was a mistake and when he got to campus he was asked to leave. Three years later Wright asked the dean for an explanation on his dismissal and the dean suggested to him that \"a member of your race might feel very much alone\" at Princeton University.[383] Princeton would not admit its first Black students until in 1945 when Princeton instituted the V-12 program on campus.[384] In 1947, John L. Howard, one of the four naval cadets admitted to the program, would become the first Black student to graduate with a bachelor's degree.[385][386]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of a tiger statue on Princeton's campus](image)Princeton's mascot is the tiger.\nPrinceton supports organized athletics at three levels: varsity intercollegiate, club intercollegiate, and intramural. It also provides \"a variety of physical education and recreational programs\" for members of the Princeton community.[387] Most undergraduates participate in athletics at some level.[388] Princeton's colors are orange and black.[389] The school's athletes are known as the *Tigers*, and the mascot is a tiger.[389][390] The Princeton administration considered naming the mascot in 2007, but the effort was dropped in the face of alumni opposition.[391]\n\n\n\n### Varsity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Princeton Tigers\n\n![A picture showing a football match between Princeton University and Lehigh University in September 2007](image)Princeton vs. Lehigh football, September 2007\nPrinceton hosts 37 men's and women's varsity sports.[388] Princeton is an NCAA Division I school, with its athletic conference being the Ivy League.[389] Its rowing teams compete in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges, and its men's volleyball team competes in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association.[392] Princeton's sailing team, though a club sport, competes at the varsity level in the MAISA conference of the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association.[393]\n\n\nPrinceton's football team competes in the Football Championship Subdivision of NCAA Division I with the rest of the Ivy League.[394] Princeton played against Rutgers University in the first intercollegiate football game in the U.S. on November 6, 1869; Rutgers won the game.[395] From 1877 until at least 1903, Princeton played football using rugby rules.[396]\n\n\nAs of 2021, Princeton claims 28 national football championships, which would make it the most of any school, although the NCAA only recognizes 15 of the wins.[397][398] With its last win being in 2018, Princeton has won 12 Ivy League championships.[399] In 1951, Dick Kazmaier won Princeton its only Heisman Trophy, the last to come from the Ivy League.[400]\n\n\nThe men's basketball program is noted for its success under Pete Carril, the head coach from 1967 to 1996. During this time, Princeton won 13 Ivy League titles and made 11 NCAA tournament appearances.[401] Carril introduced the Princeton offense, an offensive strategy that has since been adopted by a number of college and professional basketball teams.[401][402] Carril's final victory at Princeton came when the Tigers beat UCLA, the defending national champion, in the opening round of the 1996 NCAA tournament.[401] On December 14, 2005, Princeton tied the record for the fewest points in a Division I game since the institution of the three-point line in 1986–87, when the Tigers scored 21 points in a loss against Monmouth University.[403]\n\n\nPrinceton women's soccer team advanced to the NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Championship semi-finals in 2004, becoming the first Ivy League team to do so in a 64 team setting.[404][405] The men's soccer team was coached from 1984 to 1995 by Princeton alumnus and future United States men's national team manager Bob Bradley, who lead the Tigers to win two Ivy League titles and make an appearance at the NCAA Final Four in 1993.[406] Princeton's men's lacrosse program undertook a period of notable success from 1992 to 2001, during which time it won six national championships.[407] In 2012, its field hockey team became the first in the Ivy League to win a national championship.[408]\n\n\nPrinceton has won at least one Ivy League title every year since 1957, and it became the first university in its conference to win over 500 Ivy League athletic championships.[408] From 1896 to 2018, 113 athletes from Princeton have competed in the Olympics, winning 19 gold medals, 24 silver medals, and 23 bronze medals.[409]\n\n\n\n### Club and intramural[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The annual Cane Spree depicted in 1877\nIn addition to varsity sports, Princeton hosts 37 club sports teams, which are open to all Princeton students of any skill level.[410] Teams compete against other collegiate teams both in the Northeast and nationally.[410] The intramural sports program is also available on campus, which schedules competitions between residential colleges, eating clubs, independent groups, students, and faculty and staff.[304][411] Several leagues with differing levels of competitiveness are available.[412]\n\n\nIn the fall, freshman and sophomores participate in the intramural athletic competition called Cane Spree. Although the event centers on cane wrestling, freshman and sophomores compete in other sports and competitions. This commemorates a time in the 1870s when sophomores, angry with the freshmen who strutted around with fancy canes, stole all of the canes from the freshmen, hitting them with their own canes in the process.[413]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Princeton University people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Princeton University as alumni or faculty.\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain category: Princeton University alumni\n\nU.S. Presidents James Madison and Woodrow Wilson and Vice Presidents George M.

Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania both claim the fourth oldest founding date and the University of Pennsylvania once claimed 1749 as its founding date, making it fifth oldest, but in 1899 its trustees adopted a resolution which asserted 1740 as the founding date.[10][11] To further complicate the comparison of founding dates, a Log College was operated by William and Gilbert Tennent, the Presbyterian ministers, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from 1726 until 1746 and it was once common to assert a formal connection between it and the College of New Jersey, which would justify Princeton pushing its founding date back to 1726. However, Princeton has never done so and a Princeton historian says that the facts \"do not warrant\" such an interpretation.[12] Columbia University was chartered and began collegiate classes in 1754. Columbia considers itself to be the fifth institution of higher learning in the United States, based upon its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755.[13]\n2. **^** The strike was part of the broader Student Strike of 1970.\n3. **^** 505 women applied to join the Princeton freshman class.[147]\n4. **^** The M.D./Ph.D. is granted in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and the Rutgers–New Brunswick Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.

Established in 1754 as **King's College** on the grounds of Trinity Church in Manhattan, it is the oldest institution of higher education in New York and the fifth-oldest in the United States.\n\n\nColumbia was established as a colonial college by royal charter under George II of Great Britain. It was renamed Columbia College in 1784 following the American Revolution, and in 1787 was placed under a private board of trustees headed by former students Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. In 1896, the campus was moved to its current location in Morningside Heights and renamed Columbia University.\n\n\nColumbia is organized into twenty schools, including four undergraduate schools and 16 graduate schools. The university's research efforts include the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and accelerator laboratories with Big Tech firms such as Amazon and IBM.[10][11] Columbia is a founding member of the Association of American Universities and was the first school in the United States to grant the MD degree.[12] The university also annually administers the Pulitzer Prize. Its endowment stands at $13.3 billion as of 2022[update], which is among the largest of any academic institution.\n\n\nColumbia scientists and scholars have played a pivotal role in scientific breakthroughs including brain-computer interface; the laser and maser;[13][14] nuclear magnetic resonance;[15] the first nuclear pile; the first nuclear fission reaction in the Americas; the first evidence for plate tectonics and continental drift;[16][17][18] and much of the initial research and planning for the Manhattan Project during World War II.\n\n\nAs of December 2021[update], its alumni, faculty, and staff have included seven Founding Fathers of the United States;[n 2] four U.S. presidents;[n 3] 34 foreign heads of state;[n 4] two secretaries-general of the United Nations;[n 5] ten justices of the United States Supreme Court; 103 Nobel laureates; 125 National Academy of Sciences members;[60] 53 living billionaires;[61] 23 Olympic medalists;[62] 33 Academy Award winners; and 125 Pulitzer Prize recipients.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Columbia University\n\n### Colonial period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Johnson, the first president of Columbia\nDiscussions regarding the founding of a college in the Province of New York began as early as 1704, at which time Colonel Lewis Morris wrote to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the missionary arm of the Church of England, persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college.[63] However, it was not until the founding of the College of New Jersey (renamed Princeton) across the Hudson River in New Jersey that the City of New York seriously considered founding a college.[63] In 1746, an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise funds for the foundation of a new college. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the Church of England, to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college.[64]\n\n\nClasses were initially held in July 1754 and were presided over by the college's first president, Samuel Johnson.[65]: 8–10 Johnson was the only instructor of the college's first class, which consisted of a mere eight students. Instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining Trinity Church, located on what is now lower Broadway in Manhattan.[66]: 3 The college was officially founded on October 31, 1754, as King's College by royal charter of George II,[67][68] making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the State of New York and the fifth oldest in the United States.[12]\n\n\nIn 1763, Johnson was succeeded in the presidency by Myles Cooper, a graduate of The Queen's College, Oxford, and an ardent Tory. In the charged political climate of the American Revolution, his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate of the class of 1777, Alexander Hamilton.[66]: 3 The Irish anatomist, Samuel Clossy, was appointed professor of natural philosophy in October 1765 and later the college's first professor of anatomy in 1767.[69] The American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, and was catastrophic for the operation of King's College, which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the Continental Army. The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their departure in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)King's College Hall, 1790\nAfter the Revolution, the college turned to the State of New York in order to restore its vitality, promising to make whatever changes to the school's charter the state might demand.[65]: 59 The legislature agreed to assist the college, and on May 1, 1784, it passed \"an Act for granting certain privileges to the College heretofore called King's College\".[65] The Act created a board of regents to oversee the resuscitation of King's College, and, in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new Republic, the legislature stipulated that \"the College within the City of New York heretofore called King's College be forever hereafter called and known by the name of Columbia College\",[65] a reference to Columbia, an alternative name for America which in turn comes from the name of Christopher Columbus. The Regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in February 1787 and appointed a revision committee, which was headed by John Jay and Alexander Hamilton. In April of that same year, a new charter was adopted for the college granted the power to a separate board of 24 trustees.[72]: 65–70\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1797 Taylor Map of New York City, showing \"The College\" at its Park Place (then Robinson Street) location. Note earlier location, Trinity Church, lower left.\nOn May 21, 1787, William Samuel Johnson, the son of Samuel Johnson, was unanimously elected president of Columbia College. Prior to serving at the university, Johnson had participated in the First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.[73] For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. President George Washington and Vice President John Adams, in addition to both houses of Congress attended the college's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the American Revolution.[65]: 74\n\n\n\n### 19th century to present[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Student activism at Columbia University\n\n![](image)The Gothic Revival library and law school buildings on the Madison Avenue campus\n![](image)Low Memorial Library, c. 1900\n![](image)*Alma Mater*\nIn November 1813, the college agreed to incorporate its medical school with The College of Physicians and Surgeons, a new school created by the Regents of New York, forming Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.[72]: 53–60 The college's enrollment, structure, and academics stagnated for the majority of the 19th century, with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the college functioned. In 1857, the college moved from the King's College campus at Park Place to a primarily Gothic Revival campus on 49th Street and Madison Avenue, where it remained for the next forty years. During the last half of the 19th century, under the leadership of President F.A.P. Barnard, the president that Barnard College is named after, the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university. Barnard College was created in 1889 as a response to the university's refusal to accept women.[74] By this time, the college's investments in New York real estate became a primary source of steady income for the school, mainly owing to the city's expanding population.[66]: 5–8 In 1896, university president Seth Low moved the campus from 49th Street to its present location, a more spacious campus in the developing neighborhood of Morningside Heights.[65][75] Under the leadership of Low's successor, Nicholas Murray Butler, who served for over four decades, Columbia rapidly became the nation's major institution for research, setting the \"multiversity\" model that later universities would adopt.[12] Prior to becoming the president of Columbia University, Butler founded Teachers College, as a school to prepare home economists and manual art teachers for the children of the poor, with philanthropist Grace Hoadley Dodge.[63] Teachers College is currently affiliated as the university's Graduate School of Education.[76]\n\n\nResearch into the atom by faculty members John R. Dunning, I. I. Rabi, Enrico Fermi and Polykarp Kusch placed Columbia's physics department in the international spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the Manhattan Project.[77] In 1928, Seth Low Junior College was established by Columbia University in order to mitigate the number of Jewish applicants to Columbia College.[63][78] The college was closed in 1936 due to the adverse effects of the Great Depression and its students were subsequently taught at Morningside Heights, although they did not belong to any college but to the university at large.[79][80]\n\n\nThere was an evening school called University Extension, which taught night classes, for a fee, to anyone willing to attend. In 1947, the program was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the School of General Studies in response to the return of GIs after World War II.[81] In 1995, the School of General Studies was again reorganized as a full-fledged liberal arts college for non-traditional students (those who have had an academic break of one year or more, or are pursuing dual-degrees) and was fully integrated into Columbia's traditional undergraduate curriculum.[82] Within the same year, the Division of Special Programs—later the School of Continuing Education, and now the School of Professional Studies—was established to reprise the former role of University Extension.[83] While the School of Professional Studies only offered non-degree programs for lifelong learners and high school students in its earliest stages, it now offers degree programs in a diverse range of professional and inter-disciplinary fields.[84]\n\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the discipline of international relations became a major scholarly focus of the university, and in response, the School of International and Public Affairs was founded in 1946, drawing upon the resources of the faculties of political science, economics, and history.[85] The Columbia University Bicentennial was celebrated in 1954.[86]\n\n\nDuring the 1960s Columbia experienced large-scale student activism, which reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied buildings on campus. The incident forced the resignation of Columbia's president, Grayson Kirk, and the establishment of the University Senate.[87][88]\n\n\nThough several schools within the university had admitted women for years, Columbia College first admitted women in the fall of 1983,[89] after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard College, the all-female institution affiliated with the university, to merge the two schools.[90] Barnard College still remains affiliated with Columbia, and all Barnard graduates are issued diplomas signed by the presidents of Columbia University and Barnard College.[91]\n\n\nDuring the late 20th century, the university underwent significant academic, structural, and administrative changes as it developed into a major research university. For much of the 19th century, the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[92] In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously a part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.[93]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n### Morningside Heights[edit]\n\n\n![](image)College Walk\nThe majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in the Upper Manhattan neighborhood of Morningside Heights on Seth Low's late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts planning principles by the architects McKim, Mead & White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or 32 acres (13 ha), in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive tunnel system, more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.[94]\n\n\n\n![](image)Butler Library\nThe Nicholas Murray Butler Library, known simply as Butler Library, is the largest single library in the Columbia University Library System, and is one of the largest buildings on the campus. Proposed as \"South Hall\" by the university's former president Nicholas Murray Butler as expansion plans for Low Memorial Library stalled, the new library was funded by Edward Harkness, benefactor of Yale's residential college system, and designed by his favorite architect, James Gamble Rogers. It was completed in 1934 and renamed for Butler in 1946. The library design is neo-classical in style. Its facade features a row of columns in the Ionic order above which are inscribed the names of great writers, philosophers, and thinkers, most of whom are read by students engaged in the Core Curriculum of Columbia College.[95] As of 2020[update], Columbia's library system includes over 15.0 million volumes, making it the eighth largest library system and fifth largest collegiate library system in the United States.[96]\n\n\nSeveral buildings on the Morningside Heights campus are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Low Memorial Library, a National Historic Landmark and the centerpiece of the campus, is listed for its architectural significance. Philosophy Hall is listed as the site of the invention of FM radio.[97] Also listed is Pupin Hall, another National Historic Landmark, which houses the physics and astronomy departments. Here the first experiments on the fission of uranium were conducted by Enrico Fermi. The uranium atom was split there ten days after the world's first atom-splitting in Copenhagen, Denmark.[98][99] Other buildings listed include Casa Italiana, the Delta Psi, Alpha Chapter building of St. Anthony Hall, Earl Hall, and the buildings of the affiliated Union Theological Seminary.[100][101][102][103]\n\n\n\n![](image)Union Theological Seminary\nA statue by sculptor Daniel Chester French called *Alma Mater* is centered on the front steps of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library in the center of the campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a royal charter institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired.[104] The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.[105][106]\n\n\n\n\"The Steps\", alternatively known as \"Low Steps\" or the \"Urban Beach\", are a popular meeting area for Columbia students. The term refers to the long series of granite steps leading from the lower part of campus (South Field) to its upper terrace. With a design inspired by the City Beautiful movement, the steps of Low Library provides Columbia University and Barnard College students, faculty, and staff with a comfortable outdoor platform and space for informal gatherings, events, and ceremonies. McKim's classical facade epitomizes late 19th-century new-classical designs, with its columns and portico marking the entrance to an important structure.[107]\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the Morningside Heights campus as seen from Butler Library and facing Low Memorial Library\n\n### Other campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lamont Campus entrance in Palisades, New York\n![](image)The entrance to the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Washington Heights\nIn April 2007, the university purchased more than two-thirds of a 17 acres (6.9 ha) site for a new campus in Manhattanville, an industrial neighborhood to the north of the Morningside Heights campus. Stretching from 125th Street to 133rd Street, Columbia Manhattanville houses buildings for Columbia's Business School, School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia School of the Arts, and the Jerome L. Greene Center for Mind, Brain, and Behavior, where research will occur on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.[108][109] The $7 billion expansion plan included demolishing all buildings, except three that are historically significant (the Studebaker Building, Prentis Hall, and the Nash Building), eliminating the existing light industry and storage warehouses, and relocating tenants in 132 apartments. Replacing these buildings created 6.8 million square feet (630,000 m2) of space for the university. Community activist groups in West Harlem fought the expansion for reasons ranging from property protection and fair exchange for land, to residents' rights.[110][111] Subsequent public hearings drew neighborhood opposition. As of December 2008[update], the State of New York's Empire State Development Corporation approved use of eminent domain, which, through declaration of Manhattanville's \"blighted\" status, gives governmental bodies the right to appropriate private property for public use.[112] On May 20, 2009, the New York State Public Authorities Control Board approved the Manhanttanville expansion plan.[113]\n\n\nNewYork-Presbyterian Hospital is affiliated with the medical schools of both Columbia University and Cornell University. According to *U.S. News & World Report*'s \"2020–21 Best Hospitals Honor Roll and Medical Specialties Rankings\", it is ranked fourth overall and second among university hospitals.[114] Columbia's medical school has a strategic partnership with New York State Psychiatric Institute, and is affiliated with 19 other hospitals in the U.S. and four hospitals in other countries. Health-related schools are located at the Columbia University Medical Center, a 20-acre (8.1 ha) campus located in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, fifty blocks uptown. Other teaching hospitals affiliated with Columbia through the NewYork-Presbyterian network include the Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan, and the Payne Whitney Westchester, a psychiatric institute located in White Plains, New York.[115] On the northern tip of Manhattan island (in the neighborhood of Inwood), Columbia owns the 26-acre (11 ha) Baker Field, which includes the Lawrence A. Wien Stadium as well as facilities for field sports, outdoor track, and tennis. There is a third campus on the west bank of the Hudson River, the 157-acre (64 ha) Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory and Earth Institute in Palisades, New York. A fourth is the 60-acre (24 ha) Nevis Laboratories in Irvington, New York, for the study of particle and motion physics. A satellite site in Paris holds classes at Reid Hall.[12]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, the university established the Office of Environmental Stewardship to initiate, coordinate and implement programs to reduce the university's environmental footprint. The U.S. Green Building Council selected the university's Manhattanville plan for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Neighborhood Design pilot program. The plan commits to incorporating smart growth, new urbanism and \"green\" building design principles.[116] Columbia is one of the 2030 Challenge Partners, a group of nine universities in the city of New York that have pledged to reduce their greenhouse emissions by 30% within the next ten years. Columbia University adopts LEED standards for all new construction and major renovations. The university requires a minimum of Silver, but through its design and review process seeks to achieve higher levels. This is especially challenging for lab and research buildings with their intensive energy use; however, the university also uses lab design guidelines that seek to maximize energy efficiency while protecting the safety of researchers.[117]\n\n\n\nEvery Thursday and Sunday of the month, Columbia hosts a greenmarket where local farmers can sell their produce to residents of the city. In addition, from April to November Hodgson's farm, a local New York gardening center, joins the market bringing a large selection of plants and blooming flowers. The market is one of the many operated at different points throughout the city by the non-profit group GrowNYC.[118] Dining services at Columbia spends 36 percent of its food budget on local products, in addition to serving sustainably harvested seafood and fair trade coffee on campus.[119] Columbia has been rated \"B+\" by the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card for its environmental and sustainability initiatives.[120]\n\n![](image)Access to Columbia is enhanced by the 116th Street–Columbia University subway station (1 train) on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Columbia University would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (*104*) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (*25*).[121]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nColumbia Transportation is the bus service of the university, operated by Academy Bus Lines. The buses are open to all Columbia faculty, students, Dodge Fitness Center members, and anyone else who holds a Columbia ID card. In addition, all TSC students can ride the buses.[122]\n\n\nIn the New York City Subway, the ![\"1\" train](image) train serves the university at 116th Street-Columbia University. The M4, M104 and M60 buses stop on Broadway while the M11 stops on Amsterdam Avenue.\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Undergraduate admissions and financial aid[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Van Amringe Quadrangle and Memorial\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2021 enteringclass[123]Change vs.2016[124]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 3.9% (![Neutral decrease](image) −2.1)\n |\n| Yield rate | 66.5% (![Increase](image) +1.4)\n |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT Total | 1510–1560 (![Decrease](image) −10 median)\n |\n|  |\n\n\nColumbia University received 60,551 applications for the class of 2025 (entering 2021) and a total of around 2,218 were admitted to the two schools for an overall acceptance rate of 3.66%.[125] Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves as persons of color. Additionally, 50% of all undergraduates received grants from Columbia. The average grant size awarded to these students is $46,516.[126] In 2015–2016, annual undergraduate tuition at Columbia was $50,526 with a total cost of attendance of $65,860 (including room and board).[127] The college is need-blind for domestic applicants.[128]\n\n\nAnnual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. On April 11, 2007, Columbia University announced a $400 million donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge to be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education.[129] As of 2008[update], undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and then-current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies.[130] In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the Common Application. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last Ivy League university to switch to the Common Application.[131]\n\n\nScholarships are also given to undergraduate students by the admissions committee. Designations include John W. Kluge Scholars, John Jay Scholars, C. Prescott Davis Scholars, Global Scholars, Egleston Scholars, and Science Research Fellows. Named scholars are selected by the admission committee from first-year applicants. According to Columbia, the first four designated scholars \"distinguish themselves for their remarkable academic and personal achievements, dynamism, intellectual curiosity, the originality and independence of their thinking, and the diversity that stems from their different cultures and their varied educational experiences\".[132]\n\n\nIn 1919, Columbia established a student application process characterized by *The New York Times* as \"the first modern college application\". The application required a photograph of the applicant, the maiden name of the applicant's mother, and the applicant's religious background.[133]\n\n\n\n### Organization[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Columbia Graduate/Professional Schools[134] |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons | 1767\n |\n| College of Dental Medicine | 1852\n |\n| Columbia Law School | 1858\n |\n| Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1864\n |\n| Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1880\n |\n| Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation | 1881\n |\n| Teachers College, Columbia University (affiliate) | 1887\n |\n| Columbia University School of Nursing | 1892\n |\n| Columbia University School of Social Work | 1898\n |\n| Graduate School of Journalism | 1912\n |\n| Columbia Business School | 1916\n |\n| Mailman School of Public Health | 1922\n |\n| School of International and Public Affairs | 1946\n |\n| School of the Arts | 1965\n |\n| School of Professional Studies | 1995\n |\n| Columbia Climate School | 2021\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Columbia Undergraduate Schools[134] |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| Columbia College | 1754\n |\n| Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1864\n |\n| Barnard College (affiliate) | 1889\n |\n| Columbia University School of General Studies | 1947\n |\n\n\nColumbia University is an independent, privately supported, nonsectarian institution of higher education. Its official corporate name is \"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York\". The university's first charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves *ex officio*. The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the board in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the president, are nominated by the trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The trustees appoint the president and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the university's real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the university.[135]\n\n\n\n![](image)Low Memorial Library\nThe University Senate was established by the trustees after a university-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of university-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the university. These include the president of the university, the provost, the deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all of whom serve *ex officio*, and five additional representatives, appointed by the president, from the university's administration. The president serves as the Senate's presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the university. It oversees the welfare and academic freedom of the faculty and the welfare of students.[136][137][138]\n\n\nThe president of Columbia University, who is selected by the trustees in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate and who serves at the trustees' pleasure, is the chief executive officer of the university. Assisting the president in administering the university are the provost, the senior executive vice president, the executive vice president for health and biomedical sciences, several other vice presidents, the general counsel, the secretary of the university, and the deans of the faculties, all of whom are appointed by the trustees on the nomination of the president and serve at their pleasure.[135] Minouche Shafik became the 20th president of Columbia University on July 1, 2023. \n\n\n\n![](image)The Barnard College Class of 1913 processes down the steps of Low Library.\nColumbia has four official undergraduate colleges: Columbia College, the liberal arts college offering the Bachelor of Arts degree; the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering), the engineering and applied science school offering the Bachelor of Science degree; the School of General Studies, the liberal arts college offering the Bachelor of Arts degree to non-traditional students undertaking full- or part-time study; and Barnard College.[139][140] Barnard College is a women's liberal arts college and an academic affiliate in which students receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia University. Their degrees are signed by the presidents of Columbia University and Barnard College.[141][142] Barnard students are also eligible to cross-register classes that are available through the Barnard Catalogue and alumnae can join the Columbia Alumni Association.[143]\n\n\nJoint degree programs are available through Union Theological Seminary, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America,[144] and the Juilliard School.[145][146] Teachers College and Barnard College are official faculties of the university; both colleges' presidents are deans under the university governance structure.[147] The Columbia University Senate includes faculty and student representatives from Teachers College and Barnard College who serve two-year terms; all senators are accorded full voting privileges regarding matters impacting the entire university. Teachers College is an affiliated, financially independent graduate school with their own board of trustees.[137][138] Pursuant to an affiliation agreement, Columbia is given the authority to confer \"degrees and diplomas\" to the graduates of Teachers College. The degrees are signed by presidents of Teachers College and Columbia University in a manner analogous to the university's other graduate schools.[148][149][147] Columbia's General Studies school also has joint undergraduate programs available through University College London,[150] Sciences Po,[151] City University of Hong Kong,[152] Trinity College Dublin,[153] and the Juilliard School.[154]\n\n\nThe university also has several Columbia Global Centers, in Amman, Beijing, Istanbul, Mumbai, Nairobi, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, and Tunis.[155]\n\n\n\n### International partnerships[edit]\n\n\nColumbia students can study abroad for a semester or a year at partner institutions such as Sciences Po,[156] École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS), École normale supérieure (ENS), Panthéon-Sorbonne University, King's College London, London School of Economics, University College London and the University of Warwick. Select students can study at either the University of Oxford or the University of Cambridge for a year if approved by both Columbia and either Oxford or Cambridge.[157] Columbia also has a dual MA program with the Aga Khan University in London.\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[158] | 6 |\n| *Forbes*[159] | 5 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[160] | 12 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[161] | 7 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[162] | 5 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[163] | 8 |\n| *QS*[164] | 23 |\n| *THE*[165] | 11 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[166] | 7 |\n\n | \n\n| National Program Rankings[167] |\n| --- |\n| Program\n | Ranking\n |\n| Biological Sciences | 11\n |\n| Business | 8\n |\n| Chemistry | 12\n |\n| Computer Science | 11\n |\n| Earth Sciences | 5\n |\n| Economics | 9\n |\n| Engineering | 13\n |\n| English | 8\n |\n| Fine Arts | 10\n |\n| Health Care Management | 15\n |\n| History | 5\n |\n| Law | 4\n |\n| Mathematics | 7\n |\n| Medicine: Primary Care | 75\n |\n| Medicine: Research | 3\n |\n| Nursing: Doctorate | 5\n |\n| Nursing: Master's | 6\n |\n| Nursing–Anesthesia | 22\n |\n| Nursing–Midwifery | 13\n |\n| Occupational Therapy | 8\n |\n| Physical Therapy | 25\n |\n| Physics | 9\n |\n| Political Science | 8\n |\n| Psychology | 12\n |\n| Public Affairs | 23\n |\n| Public Health | 4\n |\n| Social Work | 5\n |\n| Sociology | 11\n |\n| Statistics | 5\n |\n\n | \n\n| Global Program Rankings[168] |\n| --- |\n| Program\n | Ranking\n |\n| Arts & Humanities | 18\n |\n| Biology & Biochemistry | 20\n |\n| Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems | 3\n |\n| Chemistry | 33\n |\n| Clinical Medicine | 10\n |\n| Computer Science | 36\n |\n| Economics & Business | 8\n |\n| Electrical & Electronic Engineering | 102\n |\n| Engineering | 114\n |\n| Environment/Ecology | 36\n |\n| Geosciences | 4\n |\n| Immunology | 32\n |\n| Materials Science | 57\n |\n| Mathematics | 11\n |\n| Microbiology | 33\n |\n| Molecular Biology & Genetics | 18\n |\n| Neuroscience & Behavior | 7\n |\n| Oncology | 32\n |\n| Pharmacology & Toxicology | 46\n |\n| Physics | 12\n |\n| Plant & Animal Science | 202\n |\n| Psychiatry/Psychology | 4\n |\n| Social Sciences & Public Health | 8\n |\n| Space Science | 37\n |\n| Surgery | 27\n |\n\n\n |\n\nColumbia University is ranked 12th in the United States and seventh globally for 2023–2024 by *U.S. News & World Report*. QS University Rankings listed Columbia as fifth in the United States. Ranked 15th among U.S. colleges for 2020 by *The Wall Street Journal* and *Times Higher Education*, in recent years it has been ranked as high as second. Individual colleges and schools were also nationally ranked by *U.S. News & World Report* for its 2021 edition. Columbia Law School was ranked fourth, the Mailman School of Public Health fourth, the School of Social Work tied for third, Columbia Business School eighth, the College of Physicians and Surgeons tied for sixth for research (and tied for 31st for primary care), the School of Nursing tied for 11th in the master's program and tied for first in the doctorate nursing program, and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (graduate) was ranked tied for 14th.\n\n\nIn 2021, Columbia was ranked seventh in the world (sixth in the United States) by *Academic Ranking of World Universities*, sixth in the world by *U.S. News & World Report*, 19th in the world by *QS World University Rankings*, and 11th globally by *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*. It was ranked in the first tier of American research universities, along with Harvard, MIT, and Stanford, in the 2019 report from the Center for Measuring University Performance. Columbia's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation was ranked the second most admired graduate program by Architectural Record in 2020.\n\n\nIn 2011, the Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities ranked Columbia third best university for forming CEOs in the US and 12th worldwide.\n\n\n\n#### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, Columbia's reporting of metrics used for university ranking was criticized by Professor of Mathematics Michael Thaddeus, who argued key data supporting the ranking was \"inaccurate, dubious or highly misleading.\"[169][170] Subsequently, *U.S. News & World Report* \"unranked\" Columbia from its 2022 list of Best Colleges saying that it could not verify the data submitted by the university.[171] In June 2023, Columbia University announced their undergraduate schools would no longer participate in *U.S. News & World Report's* rankings, following the lead of its law, medical and nursing schools. A press release cited concerns that such rankings unduly influence applicants and \"distill a university's profile into a composite of data categories.\"[172]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Havemeyer Hall, a National Historic Chemical Landmark, where deuterium was discovered in 1931. Research conducted in Havemeyer has led to at least seven Nobel Prizes.[173]\nColumbia is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[174] Columbia was the first North American site where the uranium atom was split. The College of Physicians and Surgeons played a central role in developing the modern understanding of neuroscience with the publication of *Principles of Neural Science*, described by historian of science Katja Huenther as the \"neuroscience 'bible' \".[175] The book was written by a team of Columbia researchers that included Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, James H. Schwartz, and Thomas Jessell. Columbia was the birthplace of FM radio and the laser.[176] The first brain-computer interface capable of translating brain signals into speech was developed by neuroengineers at Columbia.[177][178][179] The MPEG-2 algorithm of transmitting high quality audio and video over limited bandwidth was developed by Dimitris Anastassiou, a Columbia professor of electrical engineering. Biologist Martin Chalfie was the first to introduce the use of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in labeling cells in intact organisms.[180] Other inventions and products related to Columbia include Sequential Lateral Solidification (SLS) technology for making LCDs, System Management Arts (SMARTS), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (which is used for audio, video, chat, instant messaging and whiteboarding), pharmacopeia, Macromodel (software for computational chemistry), a new and better recipe for glass concrete, Blue LEDs, and Beamprop (used in photonics).[181]\n\n\nColumbia scientists have been credited with about 175 new inventions in the health sciences each year.[181] More than 30 pharmaceutical products based on discoveries and inventions made at Columbia reached the market. These include Remicade (for arthritis), Reopro (for blood clot complications), Xalatan (for glaucoma), Benefix, Latanoprost (a glaucoma treatment), shoulder prosthesis, homocysteine (testing for cardiovascular disease), and Zolinza (for cancer therapy).[182] Columbia Technology Ventures (formerly Science and Technology Ventures), as of 2008[update], manages some 600 patents and more than 250 active license agreements.[182] Patent-related deals earned Columbia more than $230 million in the 2006 fiscal year, according to the university, more than any university in the world.[183] Columbia owns many unique research facilities, such as the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information dedicated to telecommunications and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which is an astronomical observatory affiliated with NASA.\n\n\n\n### Military and veteran enrollment[edit]\n\n\nColumbia is a long-standing participant of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Yellow Ribbon Program, allowing eligible veterans to pursue a Columbia undergraduate degree regardless of socioeconomic status for over 70 years.[184] As a part of the Eisenhower Leader Development Program (ELDP) in partnership with the United States Military Academy at West Point, Columbia is the only school in the Ivy League to offer a graduate degree program in organizational psychology to aid military officers in tactical decision making and strategic management.[185]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Lee Bollinger presents the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction to Jeffrey Eugenides.\nSeveral prestigious awards are administered by Columbia University, most notably the Pulitzer Prize and the Bancroft Prize in history.[186][187] Other prizes, which are awarded by the Graduate School of Journalism, include the Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award, the National Magazine Awards, the Maria Moors Cabot Prizes, the John Chancellor Award, and the Lukas Prizes, which include the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize and Mark Lynton History Prize.[188] The university also administers the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize, which is considered an important precursor to the Nobel Prize, 51 of its 101 recipients having gone on to win either a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine or Nobel Prize in Chemistry as of October 2018; the W. Alden Spencer Award; the Vetlesen Prize, which is known as the Nobel Prize of geology; the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission Prize for the Translation of Japanese Literature, the oldest such award; the Edwin Howard Armstrong award; the Calderone Prize in public health; and the Ditson Conductor's Award.[189][190][191][192][193][194][195]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Students[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[196] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 33%\n | 33 |\n| Foreign national | 18%\n | 18 |\n| Asian | 17%\n | 17 |\n| Hispanic | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Other[a] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[b] | 19%\n | 19 |\n| Affluent[c] | 81%\n | 81 |\n\n\nIn 2020, Columbia University's student population was 31,455 (8,842 students in undergraduate programs and 22,613 in postgraduate programs), with 45% of the student population identifying themselves as a minority.[197] Twenty-six percent of students at Columbia have family incomes below $60,000. 16% of students at Columbia receive Federal Pell Grants,[198] which mostly go to students whose family incomes are below $40,000. Seventeen percent of students are the first member of their family to attend a four-year college.[199]\n\n\nOn-campus housing is guaranteed for all four years as an undergraduate. Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) share housing in the on-campus residence halls. First-year students usually live in one of the large residence halls situated around South Lawn: Carman Hall, Furnald Hall, Hartley Hall, John Jay Hall, or Wallach Hall (originally Livingston Hall). Upperclassmen participate in a room selection process, wherein students can pick to live in a mix of either corridor- or apartment-style housing with their friends. The Columbia University School of General Studies, Barnard College and graduate schools have their own apartment-style housing in the surrounding neighborhood.[200]\n\n\nColumbia University is home to many fraternities, sororities, and co-educational Greek organizations. Approximately 10–15% of undergraduate students are associated with Greek life.[201] Many Barnard women also join Columbia sororities. There has been a Greek presence on campus since the establishment in 1836 of the Delta chapter of Alpha Delta Phi.[202] The InterGreek Council is the self-governing student organization that provides guidelines and support to its member organizations within each of the three councils at Columbia, the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, and Multicultural Greek Council. The three council presidents bring their affiliated chapters together once a month to meet as one Greek community. The InterGreek Council meetings provide opportunity for member organizations to learn from each other, work together and advocate for community needs.[203]\n\n\n\n#### Publications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Copies of the *Columbia Daily Spectator* being sold during the 1962–63 New York City newspaper strike\n![](image)The Art Deco cover of the November 1931 edition of the *Jester*, celebrating the opening of the George Washington Bridge\nThe *Columbia Daily Spectator* is the nation's second-oldest continuously operating daily student newspaper.[204] *The Blue and White*[205] is a monthly literary magazine established in 1890 that discusses campus life and local politics. *Bwog*,[206] originally an offshoot of *The Blue and White* but now fully independent, is an online campus news and entertainment source. *The Morningside Post* is a student-run multimedia news publication.\n\n\nPolitical publications include *The Current*, a journal of politics, culture and Jewish Affairs;[207] the *Columbia Political Review*, the multi-partisan political magazine of the Columbia Political Union;[208] and *AdHoc*, which denotes itself as the \"progressive\" campus magazine and deals largely with local political issues and arts events.[209]\n\n\n*Columbia Magazine* is the alumni magazine of Columbia, serving all 340,000+ of the university's alumni.

Through a distribution agreement with Columbia University Press, the book is sold at major retailers and independent bookstores.[216]\n\n\nColumbia is home to numerous undergraduate academic publications. The *Columbia Undergraduate Science Journal* prints original science research in its two annual publications.[217] The *Journal of Politics & Society* is a journal of undergraduate research in the social sciences;[218] *Publius* is an undergraduate journal of politics established in 2008 and published biannually;[219] the *Columbia East Asia Review* allows undergraduates throughout the world to publish original work on China, Japan, Korea, Tibet, and Vietnam and is supported by the Weatherhead East Asian Institute;[220] *The Birch* is an undergraduate journal of Eastern European and Eurasian culture that is the first national student-run journal of its kind;[221] the *Columbia Economics Review* is the undergraduate economic journal on research and policy supported by the Columbia Economics Department; and the *Columbia Science Review* is a science magazine that prints general interest articles and faculty profiles.[222]\n\n\nHumor publications on Columbia's campus include *The Fed*, a triweekly satire and investigative newspaper, and the *Jester of Columbia.[223]*[224] Other publications include *The Columbian*, the undergraduate colleges' annually published yearbook;[225] the *Gadfly*, a biannual journal of popular philosophy produced by undergraduates;[226] and *Rhapsody in Blue*, an undergraduate urban studies magazine.[227] Professional journals published by academic departments at Columbia University include *Current Musicology* and *The Journal of Philosophy*.[228][229] During the spring semester, graduate students in the Journalism School publish *The Bronx Beat*, a bi-weekly newspaper covering the South Bronx.\n\n\nFounded in 1961 under the auspices of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, the *Columbia Journalism Review* (CJR) examines day-to-day press performance as well as the forces that affect that performance. The magazine is published six times a year.[230]\n\n\nFormer publications include the Columbia University Forum, a review of literature and cultural affairs distributed for free to alumni.[231][232]\n\n\n\n#### Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nColumbia is home to two pioneers in undergraduate campus radio broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. Many undergraduates are also involved with Barnard's radio station, WBAR. WKCR, the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-state area, claims to be the oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with Major Edwin Armstrong. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR was not a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room.[233] The station has its studios on the second floor of Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at 4 Times Square in Midtown Manhattan. Columbia Television (CTV) is the nation's second oldest student television station and the home of CTV News, a weekly live news program produced by undergraduate students.[234][235]\n\n\n\n#### Debate and Model UN[edit]\n\n\nThe Philolexian Society is a literary and debating club founded in 1802, making it the oldest student group at Columbia, as well as the third oldest collegiate literary society in the country.[236] The society annually administers the Joyce Kilmer Memorial Bad Poetry Contest.[237] The Columbia Parliamentary Debate Team competes in tournaments around the country as part of the American Parliamentary Debate Association, and hosts both high school and college tournaments on Columbia's campus, as well as public debates on issues affecting the university.[238]\n\n\nThe Columbia International Relations Council and Association (CIRCA), oversees Columbia's Model United Nations activities. CIRCA hosts college and high school Model UN conferences, hosts speakers influential in international politics to speak on campus, and trains students from underprivileged schools in New York in Model UN.[239]\n\n\n\n### Technology and entrepreneurship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pupin Hall, the physics building, showing the rooftop Rutherfurd Observatory\nColumbia is a top supplier of young engineering entrepreneurs for New York City. Over the past 20 years, graduates of Columbia established over 100 technology companies.[240]\n\n\nThe Columbia University Organization of Rising Entrepreneurs (CORE) was founded in 1999. The student-run group aims to foster entrepreneurship on campus. Each year CORE hosts dozens of events, including talks, #StartupColumbia, a conference and venture competition for $250,000, and Ignite@CU, a weekend for undergrads interested in design, engineering, and entrepreneurship. Notable speakers include Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey,[241] Alexis Ohanian, Drew Houston, and Mark Cuban. As of 2006, CORE had awarded graduate and undergraduate students over $100,000 in seed capital.\n\n\nCampusNetwork, an on-campus social networking site called Campus Network that preceded Facebook, was created and popularized by Columbia engineering student Adam Goldberg in 2003. Mark Zuckerberg later asked Goldberg to join him in Palo Alto to work on Facebook, but Goldberg declined the offer.[242] The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science offers a minor in Technical Entrepreneurship through its Center for Technology, Innovation, and Community Engagement. SEAS' entrepreneurship activities focus on community building initiatives in New York and worldwide, made possible through partners such as Microsoft Corporation.[243]\n\n\nOn June 14, 2010, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg launched the NYC Media Lab to promote innovations in New York's media industry. Situated at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, the lab is a consortium of Columbia University, New York University, and New York City Economic Development Corporation acting to connect companies with universities in new technology research. The Lab is modeled after similar ones at MIT and Stanford, and was established with a $250,000 grant from the New York City Economic Development Corporation.[244]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robert K. Kraft Field at Lawrence A. Wien Stadium\nMain article: Columbia Lions\n\nSee also: C-Rock\nA member institution of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in Division I FCS, Columbia fields varsity teams in 29 sports and is a member of the Ivy League. The football Lions play home games at the 17,000-seat Robert K. Kraft Field at Lawrence A. Wien Stadium. The Baker Athletics Complex also includes facilities for baseball, softball, soccer, lacrosse, field hockey, tennis, track, and rowing, as well as the new Campbell Sports Center, which opened in January 2013. The basketball, fencing, swimming & diving, volleyball, and wrestling programs are based at the Dodge Physical Fitness Center on the main campus.[245]\n\n\n![](image)Major League Baseball Hall of Famer, Lou Gehrig\nFormer students include Baseball Hall of Famers Lou Gehrig and Eddie Collins, football Hall of Famer Sid Luckman, Marcellus Wiley, and world champion women's weightlifter Karyn Marshall.[246][247] On May 17, 1939, fledgling NBC broadcast a doubleheader between the Columbia Lions and the Princeton Tigers at Columbia's Baker Field, making it the first televised regular athletic event in history.[248][249]\n\n\nColumbia University athletics has a long history, with many accomplishments in athletic fields. In 1870, Columbia played against Rutgers University in the second intercollegiate rugby football game in the history of the sport. Eight years later, Columbia crew won the famed Henley Royal Regatta in the first-ever defeat for an English crew rowing in English waters. In 1900, Olympian and Columbia College student Maxie Long set the first official world record in the 400 meters with a time of 47.8 seconds. In 1983, Columbia men's soccer went 18–0 and was ranked first in the nation, but lost to Indiana 1–0 in double overtime in the NCAA championship game; nevertheless, the team went further toward the NCAA title than any Ivy League soccer team in history.[250] The football program unfortunately is best known for its record of futility set during the 1980s: between 1983 and 1988, the team lost 44 games in a row, which is still the record for the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision. The streak was broken on October 8, 1988, with a 16–13 victory over arch-rival Princeton University. That was the Lions' first victory at Wien Stadium, which had been opened during the losing streak and was already four years old.[251] A new tradition has developed with the Liberty Cup. The Liberty Cup is awarded annually to the winner of the football game between Fordham and Columbia Universities, two of the only three NCAA Division I football teams in New York City.[252]\n\n\n\n### World Leaders Forum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)World Leaders Forum at Low Memorial Library\nEstablished in 2003 by university president Lee C. Bollinger, the World Leaders Forum at Columbia University provides the opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students alike to listen to world leaders in government, religion, industry, finance, and academia. The World Leaders Forum is a year-around event series that strives to provide a platform for uninhibited speech among nations and cultures, while educating students about problems and progress around the globe.[253]\n\n\nPast forum speakers include former president of the United States Bill Clinton, the prime minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former president of Ghana John Agyekum Kufuor, president of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai, prime minister of Russia Vladimir Putin, president of the Republic of Mozambique Joaquim Alberto Chissano, president of the Republic of Bolivia Carlos Diego Mesa Gisbert, president of the Republic of Romania Ion Iliescu, president of the Republic of Latvia Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga, the first female president of Finland Tarja Halonen, President Yudhoyono of Indonesia, President Pervez Musharraf of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, Iraq President Jalal Talabani, the 14th Dalai Lama, president of the Islamic Republic of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, financier George Soros, Mayor of New York City Michael R. Bloomberg, President Václav Klaus of the Czech Republic, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of Argentina, former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, and Al Gore.[254]\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Earl Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its role in serving as a venue for meetings and dances of the Columbia Queer Alliance.\nThe Columbia University Orchestra was founded by composer Edward MacDowell in 1896, and is the oldest continually operating university orchestra in the United States. Undergraduate student composers at Columbia may choose to become involved with Columbia New Music, which sponsors concerts of music written by undergraduate students from all of Columbia's schools.[255] The Notes and Keys, the oldest a cappella group at Columbia, was founded in 1909.[256] There are a number of performing arts groups at Columbia dedicated to producing student theater, including the Columbia Players, King's Crown Shakespeare Troupe (KCST), Columbia Musical Theater Society (CMTS), NOMADS (New and Original Material Authored and Directed by Students), LateNite Theatre, Columbia University Performing Arts League (CUPAL), Black Theatre Ensemble (BTE), sketch comedy group Chowdah, and improvisational troupes Alfred and Fruit Paunch.[257]\n\n\nThe Columbia Queer Alliance is the central Columbia student organization that represents the bisexual, lesbian, gay, transgender, and questioning student population. It is the oldest gay student organization in the world, founded as the Student Homophile League in 1967 by students including lifelong activist Stephen Donaldson.[258][259]\n\n\nColumbia University campus military groups include the U.S. Military Veterans of Columbia University and Advocates for Columbia ROTC. In the 2005–06 academic year, the Columbia Military Society, Columbia's student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates, was renamed the Hamilton Society for \"students who aspire to serve their nation through the military in the tradition of Alexander Hamilton\".[260]\n\n\nThe largest student service organization at Columbia is Community Impact (CI). Founded in 1981, CI provides food, clothing, shelter, education, job training, and companionship for residents in its surrounding communities. CI consists of about 950 Columbia University student volunteers participating in 25 community service programs, which serve more than 8,000 people each year.[261]\n\n\nColumbia has several secret societies, including St. Anthony Hall, which was founded at the university in 1847, and two senior societies, the Nacoms and Sachems.[262][263]\n\n\n\n## Traditions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Columbia University traditions\n\n![](image)The program for *Fly With Me* (1920), one of the only collaborations between Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Lorenz Hart\n### The Varsity Show[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Varsity Show\n\nThe Varsity Show is one of the oldest traditions at Columbia. Founded in 1893 as a fundraiser for the university's fledgling athletic teams, the Varsity Show now draws together the entire Columbia undergraduate community for a series of performances every April. Dedicated to producing a unique full-length musical that skewers and satirizes many dubious aspects of life at Columbia, the Varsity Show is written and performed exclusively by university undergraduates. Various renowned playwrights, composers, authors, directors, and actors have contributed to the Varsity Show, either as writers or performers, while students at Columbia, including Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II, Lorenz Hart, Herman J. Mankiewicz, I. A. L. Diamond, Herman Wouk, Greta Gerwig, and Kate McKinnon.[264]\n\n\nNotable past shows include *Fly With Me* (1920), *The* *Streets of New York* (1948), *The Sky's the Limit* (1954), and *Angels at Columbia* (1994). In particular, *Streets of New York*, after having been revived three times, opened off-Broadway in 1963 and was awarded a 1964 Drama Desk Award. *The Mischief Maker* (1903), written by Edgar Allan Woolf and Cassius Freeborn, premiered at Madison Square Garden in 1906 as *Mam'zelle Champagne*.[264][265]\n\n\n\n### Tree Lighting and Yule Log ceremonies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTree Lighting at College Walk\n![](image)\nThe first modern Yule Log ceremony in John Jay Hall, 1910\n\nThe campus Tree Lighting ceremony was inaugurated in 1998. It celebrates the illumination of the medium-sized trees lining College Walk in front of Kent Hall and Hamilton Hall on the east end and Dodge Hall and Pulitzer Hall on the west, just before finals week in early December. The lights remain on until February 28. Students meet at the sundial for free hot chocolate, performances by *a cappella* groups, and speeches by the university president and a guest.[266]\n\n\nImmediately following the College Walk festivities is one of Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the American Revolutionary War, but lapsed before being revived by President Nicholas Murray Butler in 1910. A troop of students dressed as Continental Army soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sundial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony is accompanied by a reading of *A Visit From St. Nicholas* by Clement Clarke Moore and *Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus* by Francis Pharcellus Church.[267]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Columbia University people\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Columbia University alumni and attendees; List of Columbia University people in politics, military and law; and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Columbia University as alumni or faculty\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images**.

Booth, John R. Dunning, George B. Pegram, Walter Zinn, Chien-Shiung Wu, Francis G. Slack, Harold Urey, Herbert L. Anderson, and Isidor Isaac Rabi, also played a significant role during the early phases of the Manhattan Project.[346]\n\n\nFollowing the rise of Nazi Germany, the exiled Institute for Social Research at Goethe University Frankfurt would affiliate itself with Columbia from 1934 to 1950.[347] It was during this period that thinkers including Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse wrote and published some of the most seminal works of the Frankfurt School, including *Reason and Revolution*, *Dialectic of Enlightenment*, and *Eclipse of Reason*.[348] Professors Edward Said, author of *Orientalism*, and Gayatri Spivak are generally considered as founders of the field of postcolonialism;[349][350] other professors that have significantly contributed to the field include Hamid Dabashi and Joseph Massad.[351][352] The works of professors Kimberlé Crenshaw, Patricia J. Williams, and Kendall Thomas were foundational to the field of critical race theory.[353]\n\n\nColumbia and its affiliated faculty have also made significant contributions to the study of religion. The affiliated Union Theological Seminary is a center of liberal Christianity in the United States, having served as the birthplace of Black theology through the efforts of faculty including James H. Cone and Cornel West,[354][355] and Womanist theology, through the works of Katie Cannon, Emilie Townes, and Delores S. Williams.[356][357][358] Likewise, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America was the birthplace of Conservative Judaism movement in the United States, which was founded and led by faculty members including Solomon Schechter, Alexander Kohut, and Louis Ginzberg in the early 20th century, and is a major center for Jewish studies in general.[359]\n\n\nOther schools of thought in the humanities Columbia professors made significant contributions toward include the Dunning School, founded by William Archibald Dunning;[360][361] the anthropological schools of historical particularism and cultural relativism, founded by Franz Boas;[362] and functional psychology, whose founders and proponents include John Dewey, James McKeen Cattell, Edward L. Thorndike, and Robert S. Woodworth.[363]\n\n\n\nNotable figures that have served as the president of Columbia University include 34th President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower, 4th Vice President of the United States George Clinton, Founding Father and U.S. Senator from Connecticut William Samuel Johnson, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Nicholas Murray Butler, and First Amendment scholar Lee Bollinger.[25]\n\n* Notable Columbia University faculty include:\n* ![Zbigniew Brzezinski](image)\n\nZbigniew Brzezinski\n* ![Sonia Sotomayor](image)\n\nSonia Sotomayor\n* ![Kimberlé Crenshaw](image)\n\nKimberlé Crenshaw\n* ![Lee Bollinger](image)\n\nLee Bollinger\n* ![Franz Boas](image)\n\nFranz Boas\n* ![Margaret Mead](image)\n\nMargaret Mead\n* ![Edward Sapir](image)\n\nEdward Sapir\n* ![John Dewey](image)\n\nJohn Dewey\n* ![Charles A.

The first was a formal change in name, giving the institution the fourth in its history. It began in 1754 as King's College and became in 1784 and remained for three thereafter Columbia College in the State of New York. From 1787 until 1896 Columbia was officially Columbia College in the City of New York, until, by trustee resolution on May 2, 1896, it became Columbia University in the City of New York.<Footnote 2: Columbia University Trustees Minutes, January 8, 1912.

Established in 1754 as **King's College** on the grounds of Trinity Church in Manhattan, it is the oldest institution of higher education in New York and the fifth-oldest in the United States.\n\n\nColumbia was established as a colonial college by royal charter under George II of Great Britain. It was renamed Columbia College in 1784 following the American Revolution, and in 1787 was placed under a private board of trustees headed by former students Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. In 1896, the campus was moved to its current location in Morningside Heights and renamed Columbia University.\n\n\nColumbia is organized into twenty schools, including four undergraduate schools and 16 graduate schools. The university's research efforts include the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and accelerator laboratories with Big Tech firms such as Amazon and IBM.[10][11] Columbia is a founding member of the Association of American Universities and was the first school in the United States to grant the MD degree.[12] The university also annually administers the Pulitzer Prize. Its endowment stands at $13.3 billion as of 2022[update], which is among the largest of any academic institution.\n\n\nColumbia scientists and scholars have played a pivotal role in scientific breakthroughs including brain-computer interface; the laser and maser;[13][14] nuclear magnetic resonance;[15] the first nuclear pile; the first nuclear fission reaction in the Americas; the first evidence for plate tectonics and continental drift;[16][17][18] and much of the initial research and planning for the Manhattan Project during World War II.\n\n\nAs of December 2021[update], its alumni, faculty, and staff have included seven Founding Fathers of the United States;[n 2] four U.S. presidents;[n 3] 34 foreign heads of state;[n 4] two secretaries-general of the United Nations;[n 5] ten justices of the United States Supreme Court; 103 Nobel laureates; 125 National Academy of Sciences members;[60] 53 living billionaires;[61] 23 Olympic medalists;[62] 33 Academy Award winners; and 125 Pulitzer Prize recipients.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Columbia University\n\n### Colonial period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Johnson, the first president of Columbia\nDiscussions regarding the founding of a college in the Province of New York began as early as 1704, at which time Colonel Lewis Morris wrote to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the missionary arm of the Church of England, persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college.[63] However, it was not until the founding of the College of New Jersey (renamed Princeton) across the Hudson River in New Jersey that the City of New York seriously considered founding a college.[63] In 1746, an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise funds for the foundation of a new college. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the Church of England, to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college.[64]\n\n\nClasses were initially held in July 1754 and were presided over by the college's first president, Samuel Johnson.[65]: 8–10 Johnson was the only instructor of the college's first class, which consisted of a mere eight students. Instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining Trinity Church, located on what is now lower Broadway in Manhattan.[66]: 3 The college was officially founded on October 31, 1754, as King's College by royal charter of George II,[67][68] making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the State of New York and the fifth oldest in the United States.[12]\n\n\nIn 1763, Johnson was succeeded in the presidency by Myles Cooper, a graduate of The Queen's College, Oxford, and an ardent Tory. In the charged political climate of the American Revolution, his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate of the class of 1777, Alexander Hamilton.[66]: 3 The Irish anatomist, Samuel Clossy, was appointed professor of natural philosophy in October 1765 and later the college's first professor of anatomy in 1767.[69] The American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, and was catastrophic for the operation of King's College, which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the Continental Army. The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their departure in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)King's College Hall, 1790\nAfter the Revolution, the college turned to the State of New York in order to restore its vitality, promising to make whatever changes to the school's charter the state might demand.[65]: 59 The legislature agreed to assist the college, and on May 1, 1784, it passed \"an Act for granting certain privileges to the College heretofore called King's College\".[65] The Act created a board of regents to oversee the resuscitation of King's College, and, in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new Republic, the legislature stipulated that \"the College within the City of New York heretofore called King's College be forever hereafter called and known by the name of Columbia College\",[65] a reference to Columbia, an alternative name for America which in turn comes from the name of Christopher Columbus. The Regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in February 1787 and appointed a revision committee, which was headed by John Jay and Alexander Hamilton. In April of that same year, a new charter was adopted for the college granted the power to a separate board of 24 trustees.[72]: 65–70\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1797 Taylor Map of New York City, showing \"The College\" at its Park Place (then Robinson Street) location. Note earlier location, Trinity Church, lower left.\nOn May 21, 1787, William Samuel Johnson, the son of Samuel Johnson, was unanimously elected president of Columbia College. Prior to serving at the university, Johnson had participated in the First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.[73] For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. President George Washington and Vice President John Adams, in addition to both houses of Congress attended the college's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the American Revolution.[65]: 74\n\n\n\n### 19th century to present[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Student activism at Columbia University\n\n![](image)The Gothic Revival library and law school buildings on the Madison Avenue campus\n![](image)Low Memorial Library, c. 1900\n![](image)*Alma Mater*\nIn November 1813, the college agreed to incorporate its medical school with The College of Physicians and Surgeons, a new school created by the Regents of New York, forming Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.[72]: 53–60 The college's enrollment, structure, and academics stagnated for the majority of the 19th century, with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the college functioned. In 1857, the college moved from the King's College campus at Park Place to a primarily Gothic Revival campus on 49th Street and Madison Avenue, where it remained for the next forty years. During the last half of the 19th century, under the leadership of President F.A.P. Barnard, the president that Barnard College is named after, the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university. Barnard College was created in 1889 as a response to the university's refusal to accept women.[74] By this time, the college's investments in New York real estate became a primary source of steady income for the school, mainly owing to the city's expanding population.[66]: 5–8 In 1896, university president Seth Low moved the campus from 49th Street to its present location, a more spacious campus in the developing neighborhood of Morningside Heights.[65][75] Under the leadership of Low's successor, Nicholas Murray Butler, who served for over four decades, Columbia rapidly became the nation's major institution for research, setting the \"multiversity\" model that later universities would adopt.[12] Prior to becoming the president of Columbia University, Butler founded Teachers College, as a school to prepare home economists and manual art teachers for the children of the poor, with philanthropist Grace Hoadley Dodge.[63] Teachers College is currently affiliated as the university's Graduate School of Education.[76]\n\n\nResearch into the atom by faculty members John R. Dunning, I. I. Rabi, Enrico Fermi and Polykarp Kusch placed Columbia's physics department in the international spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the Manhattan Project.[77] In 1928, Seth Low Junior College was established by Columbia University in order to mitigate the number of Jewish applicants to Columbia College.[63][78] The college was closed in 1936 due to the adverse effects of the Great Depression and its students were subsequently taught at Morningside Heights, although they did not belong to any college but to the university at large.[79][80]\n\n\nThere was an evening school called University Extension, which taught night classes, for a fee, to anyone willing to attend. In 1947, the program was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the School of General Studies in response to the return of GIs after World War II.[81] In 1995, the School of General Studies was again reorganized as a full-fledged liberal arts college for non-traditional students (those who have had an academic break of one year or more, or are pursuing dual-degrees) and was fully integrated into Columbia's traditional undergraduate curriculum.[82] Within the same year, the Division of Special Programs—later the School of Continuing Education, and now the School of Professional Studies—was established to reprise the former role of University Extension.[83] While the School of Professional Studies only offered non-degree programs for lifelong learners and high school students in its earliest stages, it now offers degree programs in a diverse range of professional and inter-disciplinary fields.[84]\n\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the discipline of international relations became a major scholarly focus of the university, and in response, the School of International and Public Affairs was founded in 1946, drawing upon the resources of the faculties of political science, economics, and history.[85] The Columbia University Bicentennial was celebrated in 1954.[86]\n\n\nDuring the 1960s Columbia experienced large-scale student activism, which reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied buildings on campus. The incident forced the resignation of Columbia's president, Grayson Kirk, and the establishment of the University Senate.[87][88]\n\n\nThough several schools within the university had admitted women for years, Columbia College first admitted women in the fall of 1983,[89] after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard College, the all-female institution affiliated with the university, to merge the two schools.[90] Barnard College still remains affiliated with Columbia, and all Barnard graduates are issued diplomas signed by the presidents of Columbia University and Barnard College.[91]\n\n\nDuring the late 20th century, the university underwent significant academic, structural, and administrative changes as it developed into a major research university. For much of the 19th century, the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[92] In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously a part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.[93]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n### Morningside Heights[edit]\n\n\n![](image)College Walk\nThe majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in the Upper Manhattan neighborhood of Morningside Heights on Seth Low's late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts planning principles by the architects McKim, Mead & White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or 32 acres (13 ha), in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive tunnel system, more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.[94]\n\n\n\n![](image)Butler Library\nThe Nicholas Murray Butler Library, known simply as Butler Library, is the largest single library in the Columbia University Library System, and is one of the largest buildings on the campus. Proposed as \"South Hall\" by the university's former president Nicholas Murray Butler as expansion plans for Low Memorial Library stalled, the new library was funded by Edward Harkness, benefactor of Yale's residential college system, and designed by his favorite architect, James Gamble Rogers. It was completed in 1934 and renamed for Butler in 1946. The library design is neo-classical in style. Its facade features a row of columns in the Ionic order above which are inscribed the names of great writers, philosophers, and thinkers, most of whom are read by students engaged in the Core Curriculum of Columbia College.[95] As of 2020[update], Columbia's library system includes over 15.0 million volumes, making it the eighth largest library system and fifth largest collegiate library system in the United States.[96]\n\n\nSeveral buildings on the Morningside Heights campus are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Low Memorial Library, a National Historic Landmark and the centerpiece of the campus, is listed for its architectural significance. Philosophy Hall is listed as the site of the invention of FM radio.[97] Also listed is Pupin Hall, another National Historic Landmark, which houses the physics and astronomy departments. Here the first experiments on the fission of uranium were conducted by Enrico Fermi. The uranium atom was split there ten days after the world's first atom-splitting in Copenhagen, Denmark.[98][99] Other buildings listed include Casa Italiana, the Delta Psi, Alpha Chapter building of St. Anthony Hall, Earl Hall, and the buildings of the affiliated Union Theological Seminary.[100][101][102][103]\n\n\n\n![](image)Union Theological Seminary\nA statue by sculptor Daniel Chester French called *Alma Mater* is centered on the front steps of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library in the center of the campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a royal charter institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired.[104] The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.[105][106]\n\n\n\n\"The Steps\", alternatively known as \"Low Steps\" or the \"Urban Beach\", are a popular meeting area for Columbia students. The term refers to the long series of granite steps leading from the lower part of campus (South Field) to its upper terrace. With a design inspired by the City Beautiful movement, the steps of Low Library provides Columbia University and Barnard College students, faculty, and staff with a comfortable outdoor platform and space for informal gatherings, events, and ceremonies. McKim's classical facade epitomizes late 19th-century new-classical designs, with its columns and portico marking the entrance to an important structure.[107]\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the Morningside Heights campus as seen from Butler Library and facing Low Memorial Library\n\n### Other campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lamont Campus entrance in Palisades, New York\n![](image)The entrance to the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Washington Heights\nIn April 2007, the university purchased more than two-thirds of a 17 acres (6.9 ha) site for a new campus in Manhattanville, an industrial neighborhood to the north of the Morningside Heights campus. Stretching from 125th Street to 133rd Street, Columbia Manhattanville houses buildings for Columbia's Business School, School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia School of the Arts, and the Jerome L. Greene Center for Mind, Brain, and Behavior, where research will occur on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.[108][109] The $7 billion expansion plan included demolishing all buildings, except three that are historically significant (the Studebaker Building, Prentis Hall, and the Nash Building), eliminating the existing light industry and storage warehouses, and relocating tenants in 132 apartments. Replacing these buildings created 6.8 million square feet (630,000 m2) of space for the university. Community activist groups in West Harlem fought the expansion for reasons ranging from property protection and fair exchange for land, to residents' rights.[110][111] Subsequent public hearings drew neighborhood opposition. As of December 2008[update], the State of New York's Empire State Development Corporation approved use of eminent domain, which, through declaration of Manhattanville's \"blighted\" status, gives governmental bodies the right to appropriate private property for public use.[112] On May 20, 2009, the New York State Public Authorities Control Board approved the Manhanttanville expansion plan.[113]\n\n\nNewYork-Presbyterian Hospital is affiliated with the medical schools of both Columbia University and Cornell University. According to *U.S. News & World Report*'s \"2020–21 Best Hospitals Honor Roll and Medical Specialties Rankings\", it is ranked fourth overall and second among university hospitals.[114] Columbia's medical school has a strategic partnership with New York State Psychiatric Institute, and is affiliated with 19 other hospitals in the U.S. and four hospitals in other countries. Health-related schools are located at the Columbia University Medical Center, a 20-acre (8.1 ha) campus located in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, fifty blocks uptown. Other teaching hospitals affiliated with Columbia through the NewYork-Presbyterian network include the Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan, and the Payne Whitney Westchester, a psychiatric institute located in White Plains, New York.[115] On the northern tip of Manhattan island (in the neighborhood of Inwood), Columbia owns the 26-acre (11 ha) Baker Field, which includes the Lawrence A. Wien Stadium as well as facilities for field sports, outdoor track, and tennis. There is a third campus on the west bank of the Hudson River, the 157-acre (64 ha) Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory and Earth Institute in Palisades, New York. A fourth is the 60-acre (24 ha) Nevis Laboratories in Irvington, New York, for the study of particle and motion physics. A satellite site in Paris holds classes at Reid Hall.[12]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, the university established the Office of Environmental Stewardship to initiate, coordinate and implement programs to reduce the university's environmental footprint. The U.S. Green Building Council selected the university's Manhattanville plan for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Neighborhood Design pilot program. The plan commits to incorporating smart growth, new urbanism and \"green\" building design principles.[116] Columbia is one of the 2030 Challenge Partners, a group of nine universities in the city of New York that have pledged to reduce their greenhouse emissions by 30% within the next ten years. Columbia University adopts LEED standards for all new construction and major renovations. The university requires a minimum of Silver, but through its design and review process seeks to achieve higher levels. This is especially challenging for lab and research buildings with their intensive energy use; however, the university also uses lab design guidelines that seek to maximize energy efficiency while protecting the safety of researchers.[117]\n\n\n\nEvery Thursday and Sunday of the month, Columbia hosts a greenmarket where local farmers can sell their produce to residents of the city. In addition, from April to November Hodgson's farm, a local New York gardening center, joins the market bringing a large selection of plants and blooming flowers. The market is one of the many operated at different points throughout the city by the non-profit group GrowNYC.[118] Dining services at Columbia spends 36 percent of its food budget on local products, in addition to serving sustainably harvested seafood and fair trade coffee on campus.[119] Columbia has been rated \"B+\" by the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card for its environmental and sustainability initiatives.[120]\n\n![](image)Access to Columbia is enhanced by the 116th Street–Columbia University subway station (1 train) on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Columbia University would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (*104*) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (*25*).[121]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nColumbia Transportation is the bus service of the university, operated by Academy Bus Lines. The buses are open to all Columbia faculty, students, Dodge Fitness Center members, and anyone else who holds a Columbia ID card. In addition, all TSC students can ride the buses.[122]\n\n\nIn the New York City Subway, the ![\"1\" train](image) train serves the university at 116th Street-Columbia University. The M4, M104 and M60 buses stop on Broadway while the M11 stops on Amsterdam Avenue.\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Undergraduate admissions and financial aid[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Van Amringe Quadrangle and Memorial\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2021 enteringclass[123]Change vs.2016[124]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 3.9% (![Neutral decrease](image) −2.1)\n |\n| Yield rate | 66.5% (![Increase](image) +1.4)\n |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT Total | 1510–1560 (![Decrease](image) −10 median)\n |\n|  |\n\n\nColumbia University received 60,551 applications for the class of 2025 (entering 2021) and a total of around 2,218 were admitted to the two schools for an overall acceptance rate of 3.66%.[125] Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves as persons of color. Additionally, 50% of all undergraduates received grants from Columbia. The average grant size awarded to these students is $46,516.[126] In 2015–2016, annual undergraduate tuition at Columbia was $50,526 with a total cost of attendance of $65,860 (including room and board).[127] The college is need-blind for domestic applicants.[128]\n\n\nAnnual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. On April 11, 2007, Columbia University announced a $400 million donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge to be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education.[129] As of 2008[update], undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and then-current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies.[130] In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the Common Application. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last Ivy League university to switch to the Common Application.[131]\n\n\nScholarships are also given to undergraduate students by the admissions committee. Designations include John W. Kluge Scholars, John Jay Scholars, C. Prescott Davis Scholars, Global Scholars, Egleston Scholars, and Science Research Fellows. Named scholars are selected by the admission committee from first-year applicants. According to Columbia, the first four designated scholars \"distinguish themselves for their remarkable academic and personal achievements, dynamism, intellectual curiosity, the originality and independence of their thinking, and the diversity that stems from their different cultures and their varied educational experiences\".[132]\n\n\nIn 1919, Columbia established a student application process characterized by *The New York Times* as \"the first modern college application\". The application required a photograph of the applicant, the maiden name of the applicant's mother, and the applicant's religious background.[133]\n\n\n\n### Organization[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Columbia Graduate/Professional Schools[134] |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons | 1767\n |\n| College of Dental Medicine | 1852\n |\n| Columbia Law School | 1858\n |\n| Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1864\n |\n| Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1880\n |\n| Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation | 1881\n |\n| Teachers College, Columbia University (affiliate) | 1887\n |\n| Columbia University School of Nursing | 1892\n |\n| Columbia University School of Social Work | 1898\n |\n| Graduate School of Journalism | 1912\n |\n| Columbia Business School | 1916\n |\n| Mailman School of Public Health | 1922\n |\n| School of International and Public Affairs | 1946\n |\n| School of the Arts | 1965\n |\n| School of Professional Studies | 1995\n |\n| Columbia Climate School | 2021\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Columbia Undergraduate Schools[134] |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| Columbia College | 1754\n |\n| Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1864\n |\n| Barnard College (affiliate) | 1889\n |\n| Columbia University School of General Studies | 1947\n |\n\n\nColumbia University is an independent, privately supported, nonsectarian institution of higher education. Its official corporate name is \"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York\". The university's first charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves *ex officio*. The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the board in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the president, are nominated by the trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The trustees appoint the president and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the university's real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the university.[135]\n\n\n\n![](image)Low Memorial Library\nThe University Senate was established by the trustees after a university-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of university-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the university. These include the president of the university, the provost, the deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all of whom serve *ex officio*, and five additional representatives, appointed by the president, from the university's administration. The president serves as the Senate's presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the university. It oversees the welfare and academic freedom of the faculty and the welfare of students.[136][137][138]\n\n\nThe president of Columbia University, who is selected by the trustees in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate and who serves at the trustees' pleasure, is the chief executive officer of the university. Assisting the president in administering the university are the provost, the senior executive vice president, the executive vice president for health and biomedical sciences, several other vice presidents, the general counsel, the secretary of the university, and the deans of the faculties, all of whom are appointed by the trustees on the nomination of the president and serve at their pleasure.[135] Minouche Shafik became the 20th president of Columbia University on July 1, 2023. \n\n\n\n![](image)The Barnard College Class of 1913 processes down the steps of Low Library.\nColumbia has four official undergraduate colleges: Columbia College, the liberal arts college offering the Bachelor of Arts degree; the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering), the engineering and applied science school offering the Bachelor of Science degree; the School of General Studies, the liberal arts college offering the Bachelor of Arts degree to non-traditional students undertaking full- or part-time study; and Barnard College.[139][140] Barnard College is a women's liberal arts college and an academic affiliate in which students receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia University. Their degrees are signed by the presidents of Columbia University and Barnard College.[141][142] Barnard students are also eligible to cross-register classes that are available through the Barnard Catalogue and alumnae can join the Columbia Alumni Association.[143]\n\n\nJoint degree programs are available through Union Theological Seminary, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America,[144] and the Juilliard School.[145][146] Teachers College and Barnard College are official faculties of the university; both colleges' presidents are deans under the university governance structure.[147] The Columbia University Senate includes faculty and student representatives from Teachers College and Barnard College who serve two-year terms; all senators are accorded full voting privileges regarding matters impacting the entire university. Teachers College is an affiliated, financially independent graduate school with their own board of trustees.[137][138] Pursuant to an affiliation agreement, Columbia is given the authority to confer \"degrees and diplomas\" to the graduates of Teachers College. The degrees are signed by presidents of Teachers College and Columbia University in a manner analogous to the university's other graduate schools.[148][149][147] Columbia's General Studies school also has joint undergraduate programs available through University College London,[150] Sciences Po,[151] City University of Hong Kong,[152] Trinity College Dublin,[153] and the Juilliard School.[154]\n\n\nThe university also has several Columbia Global Centers, in Amman, Beijing, Istanbul, Mumbai, Nairobi, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, and Tunis.[155]\n\n\n\n### International partnerships[edit]\n\n\nColumbia students can study abroad for a semester or a year at partner institutions such as Sciences Po,[156] École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS), École normale supérieure (ENS), Panthéon-Sorbonne University, King's College London, London School of Economics, University College London and the University of Warwick. Select students can study at either the University of Oxford or the University of Cambridge for a year if approved by both Columbia and either Oxford or Cambridge.[157] Columbia also has a dual MA program with the Aga Khan University in London.\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[158] | 6 |\n| *Forbes*[159] | 5 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[160] | 12 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[161] | 7 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[162] | 5 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[163] | 8 |\n| *QS*[164] | 23 |\n| *THE*[165] | 11 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[166] | 7 |\n\n | \n\n| National Program Rankings[167] |\n| --- |\n| Program\n | Ranking\n |\n| Biological Sciences | 11\n |\n| Business | 8\n |\n| Chemistry | 12\n |\n| Computer Science | 11\n |\n| Earth Sciences | 5\n |\n| Economics | 9\n |\n| Engineering | 13\n |\n| English | 8\n |\n| Fine Arts | 10\n |\n| Health Care Management | 15\n |\n| History | 5\n |\n| Law | 4\n |\n| Mathematics | 7\n |\n| Medicine: Primary Care | 75\n |\n| Medicine: Research | 3\n |\n| Nursing: Doctorate | 5\n |\n| Nursing: Master's | 6\n |\n| Nursing–Anesthesia | 22\n |\n| Nursing–Midwifery | 13\n |\n| Occupational Therapy | 8\n |\n| Physical Therapy | 25\n |\n| Physics | 9\n |\n| Political Science | 8\n |\n| Psychology | 12\n |\n| Public Affairs | 23\n |\n| Public Health | 4\n |\n| Social Work | 5\n |\n| Sociology | 11\n |\n| Statistics | 5\n |\n\n | \n\n| Global Program Rankings[168] |\n| --- |\n| Program\n | Ranking\n |\n| Arts & Humanities | 18\n |\n| Biology & Biochemistry | 20\n |\n| Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems | 3\n |\n| Chemistry | 33\n |\n| Clinical Medicine | 10\n |\n| Computer Science | 36\n |\n| Economics & Business | 8\n |\n| Electrical & Electronic Engineering | 102\n |\n| Engineering | 114\n |\n| Environment/Ecology | 36\n |\n| Geosciences | 4\n |\n| Immunology | 32\n |\n| Materials Science | 57\n |\n| Mathematics | 11\n |\n| Microbiology | 33\n |\n| Molecular Biology & Genetics | 18\n |\n| Neuroscience & Behavior | 7\n |\n| Oncology | 32\n |\n| Pharmacology & Toxicology | 46\n |\n| Physics | 12\n |\n| Plant & Animal Science | 202\n |\n| Psychiatry/Psychology | 4\n |\n| Social Sciences & Public Health | 8\n |\n| Space Science | 37\n |\n| Surgery | 27\n |\n\n\n |\n\nColumbia University is ranked 12th in the United States and seventh globally for 2023–2024 by *U.S. News & World Report*. QS University Rankings listed Columbia as fifth in the United States. Ranked 15th among U.S. colleges for 2020 by *The Wall Street Journal* and *Times Higher Education*, in recent years it has been ranked as high as second. Individual colleges and schools were also nationally ranked by *U.S. News & World Report* for its 2021 edition. Columbia Law School was ranked fourth, the Mailman School of Public Health fourth, the School of Social Work tied for third, Columbia Business School eighth, the College of Physicians and Surgeons tied for sixth for research (and tied for 31st for primary care), the School of Nursing tied for 11th in the master's program and tied for first in the doctorate nursing program, and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (graduate) was ranked tied for 14th.\n\n\nIn 2021, Columbia was ranked seventh in the world (sixth in the United States) by *Academic Ranking of World Universities*, sixth in the world by *U.S. News & World Report*, 19th in the world by *QS World University Rankings*, and 11th globally by *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*. It was ranked in the first tier of American research universities, along with Harvard, MIT, and Stanford, in the 2019 report from the Center for Measuring University Performance. Columbia's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation was ranked the second most admired graduate program by Architectural Record in 2020.\n\n\nIn 2011, the Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities ranked Columbia third best university for forming CEOs in the US and 12th worldwide.\n\n\n\n#### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, Columbia's reporting of metrics used for university ranking was criticized by Professor of Mathematics Michael Thaddeus, who argued key data supporting the ranking was \"inaccurate, dubious or highly misleading.\"[169][170] Subsequently, *U.S. News & World Report* \"unranked\" Columbia from its 2022 list of Best Colleges saying that it could not verify the data submitted by the university.[171] In June 2023, Columbia University announced their undergraduate schools would no longer participate in *U.S. News & World Report's* rankings, following the lead of its law, medical and nursing schools. A press release cited concerns that such rankings unduly influence applicants and \"distill a university's profile into a composite of data categories.\"[172]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Havemeyer Hall, a National Historic Chemical Landmark, where deuterium was discovered in 1931. Research conducted in Havemeyer has led to at least seven Nobel Prizes.[173]\nColumbia is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[174] Columbia was the first North American site where the uranium atom was split. The College of Physicians and Surgeons played a central role in developing the modern understanding of neuroscience with the publication of *Principles of Neural Science*, described by historian of science Katja Huenther as the \"neuroscience 'bible' \".[175] The book was written by a team of Columbia researchers that included Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, James H. Schwartz, and Thomas Jessell. Columbia was the birthplace of FM radio and the laser.[176] The first brain-computer interface capable of translating brain signals into speech was developed by neuroengineers at Columbia.[177][178][179] The MPEG-2 algorithm of transmitting high quality audio and video over limited bandwidth was developed by Dimitris Anastassiou, a Columbia professor of electrical engineering. Biologist Martin Chalfie was the first to introduce the use of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in labeling cells in intact organisms.[180] Other inventions and products related to Columbia include Sequential Lateral Solidification (SLS) technology for making LCDs, System Management Arts (SMARTS), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (which is used for audio, video, chat, instant messaging and whiteboarding), pharmacopeia, Macromodel (software for computational chemistry), a new and better recipe for glass concrete, Blue LEDs, and Beamprop (used in photonics).[181]\n\n\nColumbia scientists have been credited with about 175 new inventions in the health sciences each year.[181] More than 30 pharmaceutical products based on discoveries and inventions made at Columbia reached the market. These include Remicade (for arthritis), Reopro (for blood clot complications), Xalatan (for glaucoma), Benefix, Latanoprost (a glaucoma treatment), shoulder prosthesis, homocysteine (testing for cardiovascular disease), and Zolinza (for cancer therapy).[182] Columbia Technology Ventures (formerly Science and Technology Ventures), as of 2008[update], manages some 600 patents and more than 250 active license agreements.[182] Patent-related deals earned Columbia more than $230 million in the 2006 fiscal year, according to the university, more than any university in the world.[183] Columbia owns many unique research facilities, such as the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information dedicated to telecommunications and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which is an astronomical observatory affiliated with NASA.\n\n\n\n### Military and veteran enrollment[edit]\n\n\nColumbia is a long-standing participant of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Yellow Ribbon Program, allowing eligible veterans to pursue a Columbia undergraduate degree regardless of socioeconomic status for over 70 years.[184] As a part of the Eisenhower Leader Development Program (ELDP) in partnership with the United States Military Academy at West Point, Columbia is the only school in the Ivy League to offer a graduate degree program in organizational psychology to aid military officers in tactical decision making and strategic management.[185]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Lee Bollinger presents the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction to Jeffrey Eugenides.\nSeveral prestigious awards are administered by Columbia University, most notably the Pulitzer Prize and the Bancroft Prize in history.[186][187] Other prizes, which are awarded by the Graduate School of Journalism, include the Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award, the National Magazine Awards, the Maria Moors Cabot Prizes, the John Chancellor Award, and the Lukas Prizes, which include the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize and Mark Lynton History Prize.[188] The university also administers the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize, which is considered an important precursor to the Nobel Prize, 51 of its 101 recipients having gone on to win either a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine or Nobel Prize in Chemistry as of October 2018; the W. Alden Spencer Award; the Vetlesen Prize, which is known as the Nobel Prize of geology; the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission Prize for the Translation of Japanese Literature, the oldest such award; the Edwin Howard Armstrong award; the Calderone Prize in public health; and the Ditson Conductor's Award.[189][190][191][192][193][194][195]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Students[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[196] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 33%\n | 33 |\n| Foreign national | 18%\n | 18 |\n| Asian | 17%\n | 17 |\n| Hispanic | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Other[a] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[b] | 19%\n | 19 |\n| Affluent[c] | 81%\n | 81 |\n\n\nIn 2020, Columbia University's student population was 31,455 (8,842 students in undergraduate programs and 22,613 in postgraduate programs), with 45% of the student population identifying themselves as a minority.[197] Twenty-six percent of students at Columbia have family incomes below $60,000. 16% of students at Columbia receive Federal Pell Grants,[198] which mostly go to students whose family incomes are below $40,000. Seventeen percent of students are the first member of their family to attend a four-year college.[199]\n\n\nOn-campus housing is guaranteed for all four years as an undergraduate. Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) share housing in the on-campus residence halls. First-year students usually live in one of the large residence halls situated around South Lawn: Carman Hall, Furnald Hall, Hartley Hall, John Jay Hall, or Wallach Hall (originally Livingston Hall). Upperclassmen participate in a room selection process, wherein students can pick to live in a mix of either corridor- or apartment-style housing with their friends. The Columbia University School of General Studies, Barnard College and graduate schools have their own apartment-style housing in the surrounding neighborhood.[200]\n\n\nColumbia University is home to many fraternities, sororities, and co-educational Greek organizations. Approximately 10–15% of undergraduate students are associated with Greek life.[201] Many Barnard women also join Columbia sororities. There has been a Greek presence on campus since the establishment in 1836 of the Delta chapter of Alpha Delta Phi.[202] The InterGreek Council is the self-governing student organization that provides guidelines and support to its member organizations within each of the three councils at Columbia, the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, and Multicultural Greek Council. The three council presidents bring their affiliated chapters together once a month to meet as one Greek community. The InterGreek Council meetings provide opportunity for member organizations to learn from each other, work together and advocate for community needs.[203]\n\n\n\n#### Publications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Copies of the *Columbia Daily Spectator* being sold during the 1962–63 New York City newspaper strike\n![](image)The Art Deco cover of the November 1931 edition of the *Jester*, celebrating the opening of the George Washington Bridge\nThe *Columbia Daily Spectator* is the nation's second-oldest continuously operating daily student newspaper.[204] *The Blue and White*[205] is a monthly literary magazine established in 1890 that discusses campus life and local politics. *Bwog*,[206] originally an offshoot of *The Blue and White* but now fully independent, is an online campus news and entertainment source. *The Morningside Post* is a student-run multimedia news publication.\n\n\nPolitical publications include *The Current*, a journal of politics, culture and Jewish Affairs;[207] the *Columbia Political Review*, the multi-partisan political magazine of the Columbia Political Union;[208] and *AdHoc*, which denotes itself as the \"progressive\" campus magazine and deals largely with local political issues and arts events.[209]\n\n\n*Columbia Magazine* is the alumni magazine of Columbia, serving all 340,000+ of the university's alumni. Arts and literary publications include *The Columbia Review*, the nation's oldest college literary magazine;[210] *Surgam*, the literary magazine of The Philolexian Society;[211] *Quarto*, Columbia University's official undergraduate literary magazine;[212] *4x4*, a student-run alternative to *Quarto*;[213] *Columbia*, a nationally regarded literary journal; the *Columbia Journal of Literary Criticism*;[214] and *The Mobius Strip*, an online arts and literary magazine.[215] *Inside New York* is an annual guidebook to New York City, written, edited, and published by Columbia undergraduates. Through a distribution agreement with Columbia University Press, the book is sold at major retailers and independent bookstores.[216]\n\n\nColumbia is home to numerous undergraduate academic publications. The *Columbia Undergraduate Science Journal* prints original science research in its two annual publications.[217] The *Journal of Politics & Society* is a journal of undergraduate research in the social sciences;[218] *Publius* is an undergraduate journal of politics established in 2008 and published biannually;[219] the *Columbia East Asia Review* allows undergraduates throughout the world to publish original work on China, Japan, Korea, Tibet, and Vietnam and is supported by the Weatherhead East Asian Institute;[220] *The Birch* is an undergraduate journal of Eastern European and Eurasian culture that is the first national student-run journal of its kind;[221] the *Columbia Economics Review* is the undergraduate economic journal on research and policy supported by the Columbia Economics Department; and the *Columbia Science Review* is a science magazine that prints general interest articles and faculty profiles.[222]\n\n\nHumor publications on Columbia's campus include *The Fed*, a triweekly satire and investigative newspaper, and the *Jester of Columbia.[223]*[224] Other publications include *The Columbian*, the undergraduate colleges' annually published yearbook;[225] the *Gadfly*, a biannual journal of popular philosophy produced by undergraduates;[226] and *Rhapsody in Blue*, an undergraduate urban studies magazine.[227] Professional journals published by academic departments at Columbia University include *Current Musicology* and *The Journal of Philosophy*.[228][229] During the spring semester, graduate students in the Journalism School publish *The Bronx Beat*, a bi-weekly newspaper covering the South Bronx.\n\n\nFounded in 1961 under the auspices of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, the *Columbia Journalism Review* (CJR) examines day-to-day press performance as well as the forces that affect that performance. The magazine is published six times a year.[230]\n\n\nFormer publications include the Columbia University Forum, a review of literature and cultural affairs distributed for free to alumni.[231][232]\n\n\n\n#### Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nColumbia is home to two pioneers in undergraduate campus radio broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. Many undergraduates are also involved with Barnard's radio station, WBAR. WKCR, the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-state area, claims to be the oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with Major Edwin Armstrong. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR was not a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room.[233] The station has its studios on the second floor of Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at 4 Times Square in Midtown Manhattan. Columbia Television (CTV) is the nation's second oldest student television station and the home of CTV News, a weekly live news program produced by undergraduate students.[234][235]\n\n\n\n#### Debate and Model UN[edit]\n\n\nThe Philolexian Society is a literary and debating club founded in 1802, making it the oldest student group at Columbia, as well as the third oldest collegiate literary society in the country.[236] The society annually administers the Joyce Kilmer Memorial Bad Poetry Contest.[237] The Columbia Parliamentary Debate Team competes in tournaments around the country as part of the American Parliamentary Debate Association, and hosts both high school and college tournaments on Columbia's campus, as well as public debates on issues affecting the university.[238]\n\n\nThe Columbia International Relations Council and Association (CIRCA), oversees Columbia's Model United Nations activities. CIRCA hosts college and high school Model UN conferences, hosts speakers influential in international politics to speak on campus, and trains students from underprivileged schools in New York in Model UN.[239]\n\n\n\n### Technology and entrepreneurship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pupin Hall, the physics building, showing the rooftop Rutherfurd Observatory\nColumbia is a top supplier of young engineering entrepreneurs for New York City. Over the past 20 years, graduates of Columbia established over 100 technology companies.[240]\n\n\nThe Columbia University Organization of Rising Entrepreneurs (CORE) was founded in 1999. The student-run group aims to foster entrepreneurship on campus. Each year CORE hosts dozens of events, including talks, #StartupColumbia, a conference and venture competition for $250,000, and Ignite@CU, a weekend for undergrads interested in design, engineering, and entrepreneurship. Notable speakers include Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey,[241] Alexis Ohanian, Drew Houston, and Mark Cuban. As of 2006, CORE had awarded graduate and undergraduate students over $100,000 in seed capital.\n\n\nCampusNetwork, an on-campus social networking site called Campus Network that preceded Facebook, was created and popularized by Columbia engineering student Adam Goldberg in 2003. Mark Zuckerberg later asked Goldberg to join him in Palo Alto to work on Facebook, but Goldberg declined the offer.[242] The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science offers a minor in Technical Entrepreneurship through its Center for Technology, Innovation, and Community Engagement. SEAS' entrepreneurship activities focus on community building initiatives in New York and worldwide, made possible through partners such as Microsoft Corporation.[243]\n\n\nOn June 14, 2010, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg launched the NYC Media Lab to promote innovations in New York's media industry. Situated at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, the lab is a consortium of Columbia University, New York University, and New York City Economic Development Corporation acting to connect companies with universities in new technology research. The Lab is modeled after similar ones at MIT and Stanford, and was established with a $250,000 grant from the New York City Economic Development Corporation.[244]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robert K. Kraft Field at Lawrence A. Wien Stadium\nMain article: Columbia Lions\n\nSee also: C-Rock\nA member institution of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in Division I FCS, Columbia fields varsity teams in 29 sports and is a member of the Ivy League. The football Lions play home games at the 17,000-seat Robert K. Kraft Field at Lawrence A. Wien Stadium. The Baker Athletics Complex also includes facilities for baseball, softball, soccer, lacrosse, field hockey, tennis, track, and rowing, as well as the new Campbell Sports Center, which opened in January 2013. The basketball, fencing, swimming & diving, volleyball, and wrestling programs are based at the Dodge Physical Fitness Center on the main campus.[245]\n\n\n![](image)Major League Baseball Hall of Famer, Lou Gehrig\nFormer students include Baseball Hall of Famers Lou Gehrig and Eddie Collins, football Hall of Famer Sid Luckman, Marcellus Wiley, and world champion women's weightlifter Karyn Marshall.[246][247] On May 17, 1939, fledgling NBC broadcast a doubleheader between the Columbia Lions and the Princeton Tigers at Columbia's Baker Field, making it the first televised regular athletic event in history.[248][249]\n\n\nColumbia University athletics has a long history, with many accomplishments in athletic fields. In 1870, Columbia played against Rutgers University in the second intercollegiate rugby football game in the history of the sport. Eight years later, Columbia crew won the famed Henley Royal Regatta in the first-ever defeat for an English crew rowing in English waters. In 1900, Olympian and Columbia College student Maxie Long set the first official world record in the 400 meters with a time of 47.8 seconds. In 1983, Columbia men's soccer went 18–0 and was ranked first in the nation, but lost to Indiana 1–0 in double overtime in the NCAA championship game; nevertheless, the team went further toward the NCAA title than any Ivy League soccer team in history.[250] The football program unfortunately is best known for its record of futility set during the 1980s: between 1983 and 1988, the team lost 44 games in a row, which is still the record for the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision. The streak was broken on October 8, 1988, with a 16–13 victory over arch-rival Princeton University. That was the Lions' first victory at Wien Stadium, which had been opened during the losing streak and was already four years old.[251] A new tradition has developed with the Liberty Cup. The Liberty Cup is awarded annually to the winner of the football game between Fordham and Columbia Universities, two of the only three NCAA Division I football teams in New York City.[252]\n\n\n\n### World Leaders Forum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)World Leaders Forum at Low Memorial Library\nEstablished in 2003 by university president Lee C. Bollinger, the World Leaders Forum at Columbia University provides the opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students alike to listen to world leaders in government, religion, industry, finance, and academia. The World Leaders Forum is a year-around event series that strives to provide a platform for uninhibited speech among nations and cultures, while educating students about problems and progress around the globe.[253]\n\n\nPast forum speakers include former president of the United States Bill Clinton, the prime minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former president of Ghana John Agyekum Kufuor, president of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai, prime minister of Russia Vladimir Putin, president of the Republic of Mozambique Joaquim Alberto Chissano, president of the Republic of Bolivia Carlos Diego Mesa Gisbert, president of the Republic of Romania Ion Iliescu, president of the Republic of Latvia Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga, the first female president of Finland Tarja Halonen, President Yudhoyono of Indonesia, President Pervez Musharraf of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, Iraq President Jalal Talabani, the 14th Dalai Lama, president of the Islamic Republic of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, financier George Soros, Mayor of New York City Michael R. Bloomberg, President Václav Klaus of the Czech Republic, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of Argentina, former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, and Al Gore.[254]\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Earl Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its role in serving as a venue for meetings and dances of the Columbia Queer Alliance.\nThe Columbia University Orchestra was founded by composer Edward MacDowell in 1896, and is the oldest continually operating university orchestra in the United States. Undergraduate student composers at Columbia may choose to become involved with Columbia New Music, which sponsors concerts of music written by undergraduate students from all of Columbia's schools.[255] The Notes and Keys, the oldest a cappella group at Columbia, was founded in 1909.[256] There are a number of performing arts groups at Columbia dedicated to producing student theater, including the Columbia Players, King's Crown Shakespeare Troupe (KCST), Columbia Musical Theater Society (CMTS), NOMADS (New and Original Material Authored and Directed by Students), LateNite Theatre, Columbia University Performing Arts League (CUPAL), Black Theatre Ensemble (BTE), sketch comedy group Chowdah, and improvisational troupes Alfred and Fruit Paunch.[257]\n\n\nThe Columbia Queer Alliance is the central Columbia student organization that represents the bisexual, lesbian, gay, transgender, and questioning student population. It is the oldest gay student organization in the world, founded as the Student Homophile League in 1967 by students including lifelong activist Stephen Donaldson.[258][259]\n\n\nColumbia University campus military groups include the U.S. Military Veterans of Columbia University and Advocates for Columbia ROTC. In the 2005–06 academic year, the Columbia Military Society, Columbia's student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates, was renamed the Hamilton Society for \"students who aspire to serve their nation through the military in the tradition of Alexander Hamilton\".[260]\n\n\nThe largest student service organization at Columbia is Community Impact (CI). Founded in 1981, CI provides food, clothing, shelter, education, job training, and companionship for residents in its surrounding communities. CI consists of about 950 Columbia University student volunteers participating in 25 community service programs, which serve more than 8,000 people each year.[261]\n\n\nColumbia has several secret societies, including St. Anthony Hall, which was founded at the university in 1847, and two senior societies, the Nacoms and Sachems.[262][263]\n\n\n\n## Traditions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Columbia University traditions\n\n![](image)The program for *Fly With Me* (1920), one of the only collaborations between Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Lorenz Hart\n### The Varsity Show[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Varsity Show\n\nThe Varsity Show is one of the oldest traditions at Columbia. Founded in 1893 as a fundraiser for the university's fledgling athletic teams, the Varsity Show now draws together the entire Columbia undergraduate community for a series of performances every April. Dedicated to producing a unique full-length musical that skewers and satirizes many dubious aspects of life at Columbia, the Varsity Show is written and performed exclusively by university undergraduates. Various renowned playwrights, composers, authors, directors, and actors have contributed to the Varsity Show, either as writers or performers, while students at Columbia, including Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II, Lorenz Hart, Herman J. Mankiewicz, I. A. L. Diamond, Herman Wouk, Greta Gerwig, and Kate McKinnon.[264]\n\n\nNotable past shows include *Fly With Me* (1920), *The* *Streets of New York* (1948), *The Sky's the Limit* (1954), and *Angels at Columbia* (1994). In particular, *Streets of New York*, after having been revived three times, opened off-Broadway in 1963 and was awarded a 1964 Drama Desk Award. *The Mischief Maker* (1903), written by Edgar Allan Woolf and Cassius Freeborn, premiered at Madison Square Garden in 1906 as *Mam'zelle Champagne*.[264][265]\n\n\n\n### Tree Lighting and Yule Log ceremonies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTree Lighting at College Walk\n![](image)\nThe first modern Yule Log ceremony in John Jay Hall, 1910\n\nThe campus Tree Lighting ceremony was inaugurated in 1998. It celebrates the illumination of the medium-sized trees lining College Walk in front of Kent Hall and Hamilton Hall on the east end and Dodge Hall and Pulitzer Hall on the west, just before finals week in early December. The lights remain on until February 28. Students meet at the sundial for free hot chocolate, performances by *a cappella* groups, and speeches by the university president and a guest.[266]\n\n\nImmediately following the College Walk festivities is one of Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the American Revolutionary War, but lapsed before being revived by President Nicholas Murray Butler in 1910. A troop of students dressed as Continental Army soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sundial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony is accompanied by a reading of *A Visit From St. Nicholas* by Clement Clarke Moore and *Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus* by Francis Pharcellus Church.[267]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Columbia University people\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Columbia University alumni and attendees; List of Columbia University people in politics, military and law; and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Columbia University as alumni or faculty\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images**.

Roosevelt, who attended Columbia Law School. The three core members of Roosevelt's Brain Trust: Adolf A. Berle, Raymond Moley, and Rexford Tugwell, were law professors at Columbia.[344] The Statistical Research Group, which used statistics to analyze military problems during World War II, was composed of Columbia researchers and faculty including George Stigler and Milton Friedman.[345] Columbia faculty and researchers, including Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, Eugene T. Booth, John R. Dunning, George B. Pegram, Walter Zinn, Chien-Shiung Wu, Francis G. Slack, Harold Urey, Herbert L. Anderson, and Isidor Isaac Rabi, also played a significant role during the early phases of the Manhattan Project.[346]\n\n\nFollowing the rise of Nazi Germany, the exiled Institute for Social Research at Goethe University Frankfurt would affiliate itself with Columbia from 1934 to 1950.[347] It was during this period that thinkers including Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse wrote and published some of the most seminal works of the Frankfurt School, including *Reason and Revolution*, *Dialectic of Enlightenment*, and *Eclipse of Reason*.[348] Professors Edward Said, author of *Orientalism*, and Gayatri Spivak are generally considered as founders of the field of postcolonialism;[349][350] other professors that have significantly contributed to the field include Hamid Dabashi and Joseph Massad.[351][352] The works of professors Kimberlé Crenshaw, Patricia J. Williams, and Kendall Thomas were foundational to the field of critical race theory.[353]\n\n\nColumbia and its affiliated faculty have also made significant contributions to the study of religion. The affiliated Union Theological Seminary is a center of liberal Christianity in the United States, having served as the birthplace of Black theology through the efforts of faculty including James H. Cone and Cornel West,[354][355] and Womanist theology, through the works of Katie Cannon, Emilie Townes, and Delores S. Williams.[356][357][358] Likewise, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America was the birthplace of Conservative Judaism movement in the United States, which was founded and led by faculty members including Solomon Schechter, Alexander Kohut, and Louis Ginzberg in the early 20th century, and is a major center for Jewish studies in general.[359]\n\n\nOther schools of thought in the humanities Columbia professors made significant contributions toward include the Dunning School, founded by William Archibald Dunning;[360][361] the anthropological schools of historical particularism and cultural relativism, founded by Franz Boas;[362] and functional psychology, whose founders and proponents include John Dewey, James McKeen Cattell, Edward L. Thorndike, and Robert S. Woodworth.[363]\n\n\n\nNotable figures that have served as the president of Columbia University include 34th President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower, 4th Vice President of the United States George Clinton, Founding Father and U.S. Senator from Connecticut William Samuel Johnson, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Nicholas Murray Butler, and First Amendment scholar Lee Bollinger.[25]\n\n* Notable Columbia University faculty include:\n* ![Zbigniew Brzezinski](image)\n\nZbigniew Brzezinski\n* ![Sonia Sotomayor](image)\n\nSonia Sotomayor\n* ![Kimberlé Crenshaw](image)\n\nKimberlé Crenshaw\n* ![Lee Bollinger](image)\n\nLee Bollinger\n* ![Franz Boas](image)\n\nFranz Boas\n* ![Margaret Mead](image)\n\nMargaret Mead\n* ![Edward Sapir](image)\n\nEdward Sapir\n* ![John Dewey](image)\n\nJohn Dewey\n* ![Charles A.

The first was a formal change in name, giving the institution the fourth in its history. It began in 1754 as King's College and became in 1784 and remained for three thereafter Columbia College in the State of New York. From 1787 until 1896 Columbia was officially Columbia College in the City of New York, until, by trustee resolution on May 2, 1896, it became Columbia University in the City of New York.<Footnote 2: Columbia University Trustees Minutes, January 8, 1912.

It is one of nine colonial colleges and was chartered prior to the U.S. Declaration of Independence when Benjamin Franklin, the university's founder and first president, advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\nThe university has four undergraduate schools and 12 graduate and professional schools. Schools enrolling undergraduates include the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the Wharton School, and the School of Nursing. Among its highly ranked graduate schools are its law school, whose first professor James Wilson participated in writing the first draft of the U.S. Constitution, its medical school, which was the first medical school established in North America, and Wharton, the nation's first collegiate business school. Penn's endowment is US$20.7 billion, making it the sixth-wealthiest private academic institution in the nation as of 2022. In 2020, the university was awarded $1.5 billion in research grants, the fourth-largest of any U.S. university.[14]\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania's main campus is located in the University City neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and is centered around College Hall. Notable campus landmarks include Houston Hall, the first modern student union, and Franklin Field, the nation's first dual-level college football stadium and the nation's longest-standing NCAA Division I college football stadium in continuous operation.[15] The university's athletics program, the Penn Quakers, fields varsity teams in 33 sports as a member of NCAA Division I's Ivy League conference.\n\n\nSince its founding, Penn alumni, trustees, and faculty have included 8 signers of the Declaration of Independence, 7 signers of the Constitution, 3 Presidents of the United States, 3 U.S. Supreme Court justices, 32 U.S. senators, 163 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 19 U.S. Cabinet Secretaries, 46 governors, 28 State Supreme Court justices, and 9 foreign heads of state. Alumni and faculty include 39 Nobel laureates,[16][17] 4 Turing Award winners,[18] and a Fields Medalist.[19][20][21] Penn has graduated 32 Rhodes Scholars[22] and 21 Marshall Scholars.[23] As of 2022, Penn has the largest number of undergraduate alumni who are billionaires of all colleges and universities (17, counting only Penn's four undergraduate schools).[24] At least (a) 43 different Penn alumni have earned 81 Olympic medals (26 gold),[25][note 3] (b) 2 Penn alumni have been NASA astronauts, [26][27] and (c) 5 Penn alumni have been awarded the Medal of Honor.[28][29]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins of the college[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Academy and College of Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Benjamin Franklin\n\n![](image)Benjamin Franklin, founder of the University of Pennsylvania, was the primary founder, benefactor, and a president of the board of trustees for the Academy and College of Philadelphia, which merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to form the University of Pennsylvania in 1791.\nIn 1740, a group of Philadelphians organized to erect a great preaching hall for George Whitefield, a traveling evangelist who toured the American colonies delivering open-air sermons.[30] The building was designed and constructed by Edmund Woolley and was the largest building in Philadelphia at the time, drawing thousands of people the first time in which it was preached.[31]: 26 The preaching hall was initially intended to also serve as a charity school, but a lack of funds forced plans for the chapel and school to be suspended. \n\n\nAccording to Franklin's autobiography, it was in 1743 when he first had the idea to establish an academy, \"thinking the Rev. Richard Peters a fit person to superintend such an institution\". However, Peters declined a casual inquiry from Franklin, though Peters was one of Penn's founding trustees [1749 to 1776], President of board of trustees [1756 to 1764], and Treasurer of board of trustees [1769 to 1770][32]).\n\n\nNothing further was done by Franklin for another six years when he again contacted not just Peters but many others.[31]: 30 Hence, in the fall of 1749, Franklin circulated a pamphlet titled \"Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania\", his vision for what he called a \"Public Academy of Philadelphia\",[33] which argued for establishing an institution that would provide higher education to its citizens.\n\n\nThe 1749 proposal was seen as innovative at the time, and Franklin organized 24 trustees to help guide the institution he envisioned. The group acquired a dormant building after its owners asked Franklin's group to assume their debts and, accordingly, their inactive trusts. On February 1, 1750, a new board of trustees took over the building and trusts of the old board. On August 13, 1751, the Academy of Philadelphia, using the great hall at 4th and Arch Streets, was established and began taking in its first secondary students. A charity school also was chartered on July 13, 1753,[34]: 12 by the intentions of the original donors, although it lasted only a few years. On June 16, 1755, the College of Philadelphia was chartered, paving the way for the addition of undergraduate instruction.[34]: 13 All three schools shared the same board of trustees and were considered part of the same institution.[35] The first commencement exercises were held on May 17, 1757.[34]: 14\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania considers itself the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this is contested by Princeton and Columbia Universities.[note 4]\n\n\nUnlike the other colonial colleges that existed in 1749, including Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, and the College of New Jersey, Franklin's new school did not focus exclusively on educating clergy. He advocated what was then an innovative concept of higher education, which taught both the ornamental knowledge of the arts and the practical skills necessary for making a living and performing public service. The proposed program of study could have become the nation's first modern liberal arts curriculum, although it was never implemented because Anglican priest William Smith, who became the first provost, and other trustees strongly preferred the traditional curriculum.[46][47]\n\n\nFranklin assembled a board of trustees from among Philadelphia's leading citizens, the first such non-sectarian board in the nation. At the first meeting of the board of trustees on November 13, 1749, the issue of where to locate the school was a prime concern. Although a lot across Sixth Street from the old Pennsylvania State House, later renamed and famously known since 1776 as Independence Hall, was offered without cost by James Logan, its owner, the trustees realized that the building erected in 1740 by Edmund Woolley for George Whitefield,[48] which was still vacant, was an even more preferable site.\n\n\nThe institution of higher learning was named and known as the College of Philadelphia from 1755 to 1779. In 1779, not trusting then provost William Smith's Loyalist tendencies, the revolutionary State Legislature created a university, and in 1785 the legislature changed name to University of the State of Pennsylvania.[35][note 5] The result was a schism, with Smith continuing to operate an attenuated version of the College of Philadelphia. In 1791, the legislature issued a new charter, merging the two institutions into a new University of Pennsylvania with twelve men from each institution serving on the new board of trustees.[35]\n\n\nAlthough Penn began operating as an academy or secondary school in 1751 and obtained its collegiate charter in 1755, it initially designated 1750 as its founding date. Sometime later in its early history, Penn began naming 1749 as its founding date, which it continued to reference as the founding date for over a century, including at a centennial celebration in 1849.[49] In 1899, the board of trustees voted to adjust the founding date earlier again, this time to 1740, the date of \"the creation of the earliest of the many educational trusts the University has taken upon itself\", according to a book on the university's history.[50] The board of trustees voted in response to a three-year campaign by Penn's General Alumni Society to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740 for a number of reasons, including to appear older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746.[51]\n\n\n\n### First university[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1765 admission ticket to \"A Course of Lectures\" given by Dr. John Morgan, the founder and first professor of medicine at Penn's Medical School\nThe University of Pennsylvania considers itself the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies, though that claim is contested by other universities. Penn has two claims to being the first university in the United States, according to the former university archives director Mark Frazier Lloyd: \n\n\n\n(1) the 1765 founding of the first medical school in America[52] made Penn the first institution to offer both \"undergraduate\" and professional education (\"the 'de facto' position\")\n(2) the 1779 charter made it the first American institution of higher learning to take the name of \"University\" (\"the 'de jure' position\").[53][54][55]\n### Original campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A circa 1780 sketch of the Academy and College of Philadelphia when its first dormitory (on right) was built\nThe Academy of Philadelphia, a secondary school for boys, began operations in 1751 in an unused church assembly hall building at 4th and Arch Streets, which had sat unfinished and dormant for over a decade. Upon receiving a collegiate charter in 1755, the first classes for the College of Philadelphia were taught in the same building, in many cases to the same boys who had already graduated from The Academy of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n### Campus as Capital of United States[edit]\n\n\nWhen the British abandoned Philadelphia during the Philadelphia campaign in the American Revolutionary War, College Hall, the college's only building at the time,[note 6] served as the temporary meeting site of the Second Continental Congress from July 7 to 20, 1778.[56] The British Army, led by General Sir William Howe, damaged many important parts of Philadelphia. Howe's attack caused significant damage to the Pennsylvania State House, now known as Independence Hall, the site where the Second Continental Congress convened and which it was forced to abandon in anticipation of the British attack and occupation of the city.[57]\n\n\nBy July 7, 1778, the Second Continental Congress returned to Philadelphia with the requisite quorum, but convened at College Hall since Independence Hall was damaged by the British attack, briefly establishing Penn's campus as one of the early capitals of the United States.[58][59] Penn's brief status as the nation's capital is evidenced by a July 13, 1778, letter sent from Josiah Bartlett, a signatory to the Articles of Confederation and the Declaration of Independence, to John Langdon, who was also a Founding Father from New Hampshire. Langdon, who later became a signatory of the United States Constitution, wrote: \"The Congress meets in the College Hall[note 7] as the State House was left by the enemy in a most filthy and sordid situation, as were many of the public and private buildings in the City.\"[60]\n\n\n\n### 9th Street campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A c. 1815 illustration of the Ninth Street campus of the University of Pennsylvania, including the medical department (on left) and the college building (on right), which was originally intended to serve as the residence for the President of the United States before the national capital was moved from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. in 1800\n![](image)A ticket to an 1807 lecture by Benjamin Rush, then a professor at Penn's Department of Medicine[61]\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus, located on the west side of Ninth Street between Market and Chestnut Streets, and a hand-colored lithograph created in 1842 by John Caspar Wild of Medical Hall (on left) and College Hall (on right), both built between 1829 and 1830\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus above Chestnut Street and Medical Hall just prior to the university's 1871 move to its current location in West Philadelphia\nIn 1802, the university moved to the unused Presidential Mansion at Ninth and Market Streets, a building that both George Washington and John Adams had declined to occupy while Philadelphia was the nation's capital.[34]\n\n\nAmong the classes given in 1807 at this building were those offered by Benjamin Rush, a professor of chemistry, medical theory, and clinical practice who was also a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, member of the Continental Congress,[62][63] and surgeon general of the Continental Army.[64] \nClasses were held in the mansion until 1829 when it was demolished. Architect William Strickland designed twin buildings on the same site, College Hall[note 8] and Medical Hall (both 1829–1830), which formed the core of the Ninth Street Campus until Penn's move to West Philadelphia in the 1870s.\n\n\n\n### West Philadelphia campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An illustration of Penn's College Hall from a pocket guide to the Centennial Exhibition in 1876, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence\n![](image)An illustration of the University of Pennsylvania campus in West Philadelphia from a *Brief Guide to Philadelphia*, published in 1918\nAfter being located in downtown Philadelphia for more than a century, the campus was moved across the Schuylkill River to property purchased from the Blockley Almshouse in West Philadelphia in 1872, where it has since remained in an area now known as University City.\n\n\n\n### Residential university[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1750s, roughly 40 percent of Penn students needed lodging since they came from areas in the U.S. that were too far to commute, or were international students.[65] Before the completion of the construction of the first dormitory in 1765, out of town students were typically placed with guardians in the homes of faculty or in suitable boarding houses, such as the one run by widow Rachel Marks Graydon, mother of Penn College Class of 1775 student Alexander Graydon.[66][67]\n\n\nIn 1765, the campus was expanded by opening of the newly completed dormitory run by Benjamin Franklin's collaborator on the study of electricity using electrostatic machines and related technology and Penn professor and chief master Ebenezer Kinnersley.[note 9] Kinnersley was designated steward of the students in the dormitory and he and his wife were given disciplinary powers over the students and supervised the cleanliness of the students with respect to personal hygiene and washing of the students' dirty clothing.[68][69]\n\n\nEven after its construction, however, many students sought living quarters elsewhere, where they would have more personal freedom, resulting in a loss of funds to the university. In the fall of 1775, Penn's trustees voted to advertise to lease the dormitory to a private family who would board the pupils at lesser cost to Penn.[70] In another attempt to control the off-campus activities of the students, the trustees agreed not to admit any out-of-town student unless he was lodged in a place which they and the faculty considered proper.[65] As of 1779, Penn, through its trustees, owned three houses on Fourth Street, just north of the campus's new building with the largest residence located on the corner of Fourth and Arch Streets.[71][65]\n\n\nStarting in 1849 with formation of Penn's Eta chapter[note 10] of Delta Phi by five founders and 15 initiates,[72] Penn students began to establish residential fraternity houses. Since Penn only had limited housing near campus and since students, especially those at the medical school, came from all over the country, the students elected to fend for themselves rather than live in housing owned by Penn trustees. A number chose housing by pledging and living in Penn's first fraternities, which included Delta Phi, Zeta Psi, Phi Kappa Sigma, and Delta Psi.[73] These first fraternities were located within walking distance of 9th and Chestnut Street since the campus was located from 1800 to 1872 on the west side of Ninth Street, from Market Street on the north to Chestnut Street on the south. Zeta Psi Fraternity was located at the southeast corner of 10th Street and Chestnut Street, Delta Phi was located on the south side of 11th Street near Chestnut Street, and Delta Psi was located on the north side of Chestnut Street, west of 10th Street.[74]\n\n\nWhen Penn moved to West Philadelphia in 1872, the new campus and its associated fraternities centered on the intersection of Woodland Avenue, 36th Street, and Locust Street. Among the first fraternities to build near the new campus were Phi Delta Theta in 1883 and Psi Upsilon in 1891. By 1891, there were at least 17 fraternities at the university.[75]\n\n\nFrom its founding until construction of the Quadrangle Dormitories, which started construction in 1895, the university largely lacked university-owned housing with the exception of a significant part of the 18th century. A significant portion of the undergraduate population commuted from Delaware Valley locations, and a large number of students resided in the Philadelphia area.[76] The medical school, then with roughly half the students, was a significant exception to this trend as it attracted a more geographically diverse population of students. For example, in the 1850s when Penn's medical school accounted for two-thirds to three-quarters of the student body, over half of the population of the medical school was from the southern part of the United States.[77][78]\n\n\nThe university experienced increased need for housing in the last decade of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century as it began to compete with peer institutions to recruit foreign students.\n\n\nGeorge Henderson, president of the class of 1889, wrote in his monograph distributed to his classmates at their 20th reunion that Penn's strong growth in acreage and number of buildings it constructed over the prior two decades (along with a near-quadrupling in the size of the student body) was accommodated by building The Quad.[79]\n\n\nHenderson argued that building The Quad was influential in attracting students, and he appealed for it to be expanded:[80]\n\n\n\n\n> And the new buildings? First of all there is need of greater dormitory room. Did you ever live in the \"dorms?\" Then you do not know what \"dorm\" life means for college spirit. Several hundred men who live in the same big family have a feeling of common fellowship. Life in the \"dorms\" develops what our sociologists call a \"Solidarity of Responsibility.\" Men who live there learn to care for the associations that brought them together and that keep them related. And this college spirit they never lose or forget.\n> Some parents, living at a distance, do not like to send their sons to live in a general boarding house. But a dormitory, a University institution, appeals to them, and the boys come and live there. You would scarcely believe it, but when College opened last fall not only were the dormitory rooms over subscribed, but there was a long list of anxious ones, ready to snap up the room of any unlucky fellow who might miss his examinations, and be forced to spend another year at preparatory school grind. So we need the new dormitories, and although they are going up steadily, they might well go up faster.[80]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1911, since it was difficult to house the international students due to the segregation-era housing regulations in Philadelphia and across the United States, the Christian Association at the University of Pennsylvania hired its first Foreign Mission Secretary, Reverend Alpheus Waldo Stevenson.[81] By 1912, Stevenson focused almost all his efforts on the foreign students at Penn who needed help finding housing resulting in the Christian Association buying 3905 Spruce Street located adjacent to Penn's West Philadelphia campus.[82] By January 1, 1918, 3905 Spruce Street officially opened under the sponsorship of the Christian Association as a Home for Foreign Students, which came to be known as the International Students' House with Reverend Stevenson as its first director. The International Students' House provided \" ... counseling and information services for a host of problems foreign students might encounter, including language, financial, health and diet, immigration and technical problems as well as maladjustment to living in the United States. It was also used for recreation and leisure, as lounges had radio, phonograph and television facilities and there were game and reception rooms. The International Students' House also provided for programs including forums, debates, lectures, panels and planned trips and outings as well as weekend activities such as dances, films and game nights. Also, for the next thirty-three years, the International Students' House would be sponsored by the Christian Association of the University of Pennsylvania.\"[83]\n\n\nThe success of efforts to reach out to the international students was reported in 1921 when the university reported that the university's 12,000 students at the time came from all 50 states and 253 came from at least 50 foreign countries and foreign territories, including India, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and \"...every Latin American country, and most of the Oriental and European nations\".[84]\n\n\nBy 1931, first-year students were required to live in the quadrangle unless they received official permission to live with their families or other relatives.[77] However, throughout this period and into the early post-World War II period, the undergraduate schools of the university continued to have a large commuting population.[85] As an example, into the late 1940s, two-thirds of Penn women students were commuters.[86]\n\n\nAfter World War II, the university began a capital spending program to overhaul its campus, including its student housing. A large number of students migrating to universities under the G.I. Bill, and the ensuing increase in Penn's student population highlighted that Penn had outgrown previous expansions, which ended during the Great Depression era. But in addition to a significant student population from the Delaware Valley, the university continued to attract international students from at least 50 countries and from all 50 states as early as of the second decade of the 1920s.[84][87] Penn Trustee Paul Miller wrote that, in the post-World War II era,: \"[t]he bricks-and-mortar Capital Campaign of the Sixties...built the facilities that turned Penn from a commuter school to a residential one....\"[88] By 1961, 79% of male undergraduates and 57% of female undergraduates lived on campus.[89]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1930 to 1966, there were 54 documented Rowbottom riots, a student tradition of rioting which included everything from car smashing to panty raids.[90] After 1966, there were five more instances of \"Rowbottoms\", the latest occurring in 1980.[90]\n\n\nIn 1965, Penn students learned that the university was sponsoring research projects for the United States' chemical and biological weapons program.[91] According to Herman and Rutman, the revelation that \"CB Projects Spicerack and Summit were directly connected with U.S. military activities in Southeast Asia\", caused students to petition Penn president Gaylord Harnwell to halt the program, citing the project as being \"immoral, inhuman, illegal, and unbefitting of an academic institution\".[91] Members of the faculty believed that an academic university should not be performing classified research and voted to re-examine the university agency which was responsible for the project on November 4, 1965.[91]\n\n\nIn 1983, members of the Animal Liberation Front broke into the Head Injury Clinical Research Laboratory in the School of Medicine and stole research audio and video tapes. The stolen tapes were given to PETA who edited the footage to create a film, *Unnecessary Fuss*. As a result of media coverage and pressure from animal rights activists, the project was closed down.[92]\n\n\nThe school gained notoriety in 1993 for the water buffalo incident in which a student who told a group of mostly black female students to \"shut up, you water buffalo\" was charged with violating the university's racial harassment policy.[93]\n\n\nIn 2022, some asked for the tenure of a University of Pennsylvania law school professor to be revoked after she said the country is \"better off with fewer Asians.\"[94][95]\n\n\n\n### Educational innovations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Houston Hall, the first college student union in the nation\n![](image)Franklin Institute's chief meteorologist Jon Nese (left) and his production crew from WHYY-TV (right) in front of a portion of the original ENIAC computer in the university's ENIAC museum on campus\nPenn's educational innovations include the nation's first medical school in 1765; the first university teaching hospital in 1874; the Wharton School, the world's first collegiate business school, in 1881; the first American student union building, Houston Hall, in 1896;[96] the only school of veterinary medicine in the United States that originated directly from its medical school, in 1884;[97][98] and the home of ENIAC, the world's first electronic, large-scale, general-purpose digital computer in 1946. Penn is also home to the oldest continuously functioning psychology department in North America and is where the American Medical Association was founded.[99][100] In 1921, Penn was also the first university to award a PhD in economics to an African American woman, Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander.[101]\n\n\n\n### Motto[edit]\n\n\nIn 1932, all elements of the seal were revised. As part of the redesign, it was decided that the new motto \"mutilated\" Horace, and it was changed to its present wording, *Leges Sine Moribus Vanae*, 'Laws without morals [are] useless'.[102]\nPenn's motto is based on a line from Horace's III.24 (Book 3, Ode 24), *quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt?*, 'of what avail empty laws without [good] morals?'. From 1756 to 1898, the motto read **Sine Moribus Vanae**. When it was pointed out that the motto could be translated as 'Loose women without morals', the university quickly changed the motto to *literae sine moribus vanae*, 'Letters without morals [are] useless'.\n\n\n\n### Seal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 1757 seal of the Academy and College of Philadelphia; in 1779, the college was renamed the \"University in Philadelphia\" and, following the end of the Revolutionary War in 1782, assumed its current name, the University of Pennsylvania\nThe official seal of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania serves as the signature and symbol of authenticity on documents issued by the corporation.[103] A request for one was first recorded in a meeting of the trustees in 1753 during which some of the Trustees \"desired to get a Common Seal engraved for the Use of [the] Corporation\". In 1756, a public seal and motto for the college was engraved in silver.[104] The most recent design, a modified version of the original seal, was approved in 1932, adopted a year later and is still used for much of the same purposes as the original.[103]\n\n\nThe outer ring of the current seal is inscribed with \"Universitas Pennsylvaniensis\", the Latin name of the University of Pennsylvania. The inside contains seven stacked books on a desk with the titles of subjects of the trivium and a modified quadrivium, components of a classical education: Theolog[ia], Astronom[ia], Philosoph[ia], Mathemat[ica], Logica, Rhetorica and Grammatica. Between the books and the outer ring is the Latin motto of the university, \"Leges Sine Moribus Vanae\".[103]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)This statue of Benjamin Franklin, donated to the City of Philadelphia in 1899, now sits in front of College Hall at the center of Penn's main campus in honor of Franklin, the university's founder.[105]\n![](image)A 1915 map of the University of Pennsylvania campus in West Philadelphia, published by Rand McNally[106]\n![](image)Upper Quad Gate forming lower part of Memorial Tower, which honors veterans of the Spanish–American War\n![](image)Center City Philadelphia seen from the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District with Huntsman Hall in the foreground\n![](image)Wistar Institute's seven-story steel and glass 2014 building located next to a brick building, constructed in 1897, both on Penn's main historic campus on North side of Spruce Street between 36th and 37th streets\nMuch of Penn's architecture was designed by the Philadelphia-based architecture firm Cope and Stewardson, whose owners were Philadelphia born and raised architects and professors at Penn who also designed Princeton University and a large part of Washington University in St. Louis.[107][108] They were known for having combined the Gothic architecture of the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge with the local landscape to establish the Collegiate Gothic style.[109]\n\n\nThe present core campus covers over 299 acres (121 ha) in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia's University City section, whereas the older heart of the campus comprises the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District. All of Penn's schools and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. The surrounding neighborhood includes several restaurants, bars, a large upscale grocery store, and a movie theater on the western edge of campus. Penn's core campus borders Drexel University and is a few blocks from the University City campus of Saint Joseph's University (which absorbed University of the Sciences in Philadelphia via a merger) and The Restaurant School at Walnut Hill College.\n\n\nThe renowned cancer research center Wistar Institute is also located on campus. In 2014, a new 7-story glass and steel building was completed next to the institute's original brick edifice built in 1897 further expanding collaboration between the university and the Wistar Institute.[110]\n\n\nThe Module 6 Utility Plant and Garage at Penn was designed by BLT Architects and completed in 1995. Module 6 is located at 38th and Walnut and includes spaces for 627 vehicles, 9,000 sq ft (840 m2) of storefront retail operations, a 9,500-ton chiller module and corresponding extension of the campus chilled water loop, and a 4,000-ton ice storage facility.[111]\n\n\nIn 2010, in its first significant expansion across the Schuylkill River, Penn purchased 23 acres (9.3 ha) at the northwest corner of 34th Street and Grays Ferry Avenue, the then site of DuPont Marshall Research Labs. In October 2016, Penn completed the design (with help from architects Matthias Hollwich, Marc Kushner, and KSS Architects) and renovation of the center piece of the project, a former paint factory it named *Pennovation Works*. *Pennovation Works* houses shared desks, wet labs, common areas, a \"pitch bleacher,\" and other attributes of a tech incubator. The rest of the site, which Penn is formally calling \"South Bank\" (of Schuylkill River), is a mixture of lightly refurbished industrial buildings that serve as affordable and flexible workspaces and land for future development. Penn hopes that \"South Bank will provide a place for academics, researchers, and entrepreneurs to establish their businesses in close proximity to each other to facilitate cross-pollination of their ideas, creativity, and innovation.[112]\n\n\n\n### Parks and arboreta[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Penn acquired about 35 acres (14 ha) between the campus and the Schuylkill River at the former site of the Philadelphia Civic Center and a nearby 24-acre (9.7 ha) site then owned by the United States Postal Service. Dubbed the Postal Lands, the site extends from Market Street on the north to Penn's Bower Field on the south, including the former main regional U.S. Postal Building at 30th and Market Streets, now the regional office for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Over the next decade, the site became the home to educational, research, biomedical, and mixed-use facilities. The first phase, comprising a park and athletic facilities, opened in the fall of 2011.\n\n\nIn September 2011, Penn completed the construction of the $46.5 million, 24-acre (9.7 ha) Penn Park, which features passive and active recreation and athletic components framed and subdivided by canopy trees, lawns, and meadows. It is located east of the Highline Green and stretches from Walnut Street to South Streets.\n\n\nPenn maintains two arboreta. The first is the roughly 300-acre (120 ha) *The Penn Campus Arboretum at the University of Pennsylvania* encompasses the entire University City main campus. The campus arboretum is an urban forest with over 6,500 trees representing 240 species of trees and shrubs, ten specialty gardens and five urban parks,[113] which has been designated as a Tree Campus USA[114] since 2009 and formally recognized as an accredited ArbNet Arboretum since 2017.[113] Penn maintains an interactive website linked to Penn's comprehensive tree inventory, which allows users to explore Penn's entire collection of trees.[115] The second arboretum, Penn's Morris Arboretum & Gardens (the official arboretum of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania) is 92 acres (sited over 15 miles from Penn's \"Campus Arboretum\") and contains more than 13,000 labelled plants from over 2,500 types, representing the temperate floras of North America, Asia, and Europe, with a primary focus on Asia \n[116]\n\n\n\n### Bolton Center[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Bolton Center\n\nPenn also owns the 687-acre (278 ha) New Bolton Center, the research and large-animal health care center of its veterinary school.[117] Located near Kennett Square, New Bolton Center received nationwide media attention when Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro underwent surgery at its Widener Hospital for injuries suffered while running in the Preakness Stakes.[118]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nPenn's library began in 1750 with a donation of books from cartographer Lewis Evans. Twelve years later, then-provost William Smith sailed to England to raise additional funds to increase the collection size. Benjamin Franklin was one of the libraries' earliest donors and, as a trustee, saw to it that funds were allocated for the purchase of texts from London, many of which are still part of the collection, more than 250 years later.\n\n\nPenn library system has grown into a system of 14 libraries with 400 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees and a total operating budget of more than $48 million.[119] The library system has 6.19 million book and serial volumes as well as 4.23 million microform items and 1.11 million e-books.[8] It subscribes to over 68,000 print serials and e-journals.[120][121]\n\n\nPenn has the following libraries, associated by school or subject area: (1) communications library, located on campus on Walnut Street between 36th and 37th Streets in the Annenberg Communications School; (2) Biddle Law Library, located on campus on 3500 block of Sansom in the Law School; (3) The Holman Biotech Commons library, located on campus, on 3500 block of Hamilton Walk, adjacent to the Robert Wood Johnson Pavilion of the Medical School and the Nursing School; (4) chemistry library, located on campus, on 3300 block of Spruce, in the 1973 Wing of the Chemistry Building; (5) dental medicine library located on campus, on 4000 block of Locust Street, in Dental School; (6) fine arts library, located on campus, on 3400 block of Woodland Ave, within the Fisher Fine Arts Library; (7) Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies library, located off campus, at 420 Walnut Street, near Independence Hall and Washington Square; (8) humanities and social sciences library (including Weigle Information Commons) located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street in the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (9) Lea library collection of Roman Catholic Church history, located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street, on the 6th floor of Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (10) Lippincott business library, located on campus, between 35th and 36th streets on Locust Street, in the second floor of the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (11) Math/Physics/Astronomy library, located on campus, on 3200 block of Walnut Streets, adjacent to The Palestra on the third floor of David Rittenhouse Laboratory; (12) archaeology and anthropology library within Penn Museum; (13) Rare Books and Manuscripts library (including the Yarnall Library of Theology) located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street, in Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (14) veterinary medicine library, located on Penn Campus, between 38th and 39th streets on Sansom Street, within the Vet School (with satellite library located off campus at New Bolton Center. Penn also maintains books and records off campus at high density storage facility.\n\n\nThe Penn Design School's Fine Arts Library was built to be Penn's main library and the first with its own building. The main library at the time was designed by Frank Furness to be first library in nation to separate the low ceilings of the library stack, where the books were stored, from forty-foot-plus high ceilinged rooms, where the books were read and studied.[122][123][124]\n\n\nThe Yarnall Library of Theology, a major American rare book collection, is part of Penn's libraries. The Yarnall Library of Theology was formerly affiliated with St. Clement's Church in Philadelphia. It was founded in 1911 under the terms of the wills of Ellis Hornor Yarnall (1839–1907) and Emily Yarnall, and subsequently housed at the former Philadelphia Divinity School. The library's major areas of focus are theology, patristics, and the liturgy, history and theology of the Anglican Communion and the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. It includes a large number of rare books, incunabula, and illuminated manuscripts, and new material continues to be added.[125][126]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nVan Pelt Library, Penn's main library building\n* ![](image)\n\nInterior of the reading room at what is now School of Design library.

This 5,900-pound (2,700 kg) bronze sculpture, which is 16 feet (4.9 m) high and 9 feet (2.7 m) in diameter at its base, depicts an African woman's head crowned with an afro framed by cornrow braids atop a form that resembles both a skirt and a clay house.[130] At the installation, Penn president Amy Guttman proclaimed that \"Ms. Leigh's sculpture brings a striking presence of strength, grace, and beauty—along with an ineffable sense of mystery and resilience—to a central crossroad of Penn's campus.\"[131]\n\n\nThe *Covenant*, known to the student body as \"Dueling Tampons\"[132][133] or \"The Tampons\",[134] is a large red structure created by Alexander Liberman and located on Locust Walk as a gateway to the high-rise residences \"super block\". It was installed in 1975 and is made of rolled sheets of milled steel.\n\n\nA white button, known as The Button and officially called the Split Button is a modern art sculpture designed by designed by Swedish sculptor Claes Oldenburg (who specialized in creating oversize sculptures of everyday objects). It sits at the south entrance of Van Pelt Library and has button holes large enough for people to stand inside. Penn also has a replica of the *Love* sculpture, part of a series created by Robert Indiana. It is a painted aluminum sculpture and was installed in 1998 overlooking College Green.[129]\n\n\nIn 2019, the Association for Public Art loaned Penn[135] two multi-ton sculptures.[136] The two works are *Social Consciousness*[137][135] (created by Sir Jacob Epstein in 1954 and sited on the walkway between Wharton's Lippincott Library and Phi Phi chapter of Alpha Chi Rho fraternity house) and *Atmosphere and Environment XII* (created by Louise Nevelson in 1970, which is sited on Shoemaker Green between Franklin Field and Ringe Squash Courts).[138]\n\n\nIn addition to the contemporary art, Penn also has a number of more traditional statues including a good number created by Penn's first Director of Physical Education Department, R. Tait McKenzie.[139] Among the notable sculptures is that of *Young Ben Franklin*, which McKenzie produced and Penn sited adjacent to the fieldhouse contiguous to Franklin Field. The sculpture is titled *Benjamin Franklin in 1723* and was created by McKenzie during the pre-World War 1 era (1910–1914). Other sculptures he produced for Penn include the 1924 sculpture of then Penn provost Edgar Fahs Smith.\n\n\nPenn is presently reevaluating all of its public art and has formed a working group led by Penn Design dean Frederick Steiner, who was part of a similar effort at the University of Texas at Austin (that led to the removal of statues of Jefferson Davis and other Confederate officials), and Penn's Chief Diversity Officer, Joann Mitchell. Penn has begun the process of adding art and removing or relocating art.[140] Penn removed from campus in 2020 the statue of the Reverend George Whitefield (who had inspired the 1740 establishment of a trust to establish a charity school, which trust Penn legally assumed in 1749) when research showed Whitefield owned fifty enslaved people and drafted and advocated for the key theological arguments in favor of slavery in Georgia and the rest of the Thirteen Colonies.[141]\n\n\n\n### Penn Museum[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\n\n![](image)University Museum and Warden Garden\n![](image)Sphinx of Ramses II at the great temple of Ptah in Memphis, circa 1200 BC\n![](image)Penn Museum's black granite statue of Goddess Sekhmet excavated in Thebes in Ramesseum in the late 18th dynasty of Egypt of 1405 to 1367 BC\nSince the Penn Museum was founded in 1887,[142] it has taken part in 400 research projects worldwide.[143] The museum's first project was an excavation of Nippur, a location in current day Iraq.[144]\n\n\nPenn Museum is home to the largest authentic sphinx in North America at about seven feet high, four feet wide, 13 feet long, and 12.9 tons (made of solid red granite).\n\n\nThe sphinx was discovered in 1912 by the British archeologist, Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, during an excavation of the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis, Egypt, where the sphinx had guarded a temple to ward off evil. Since Petri's expedition was partially financed by Penn Petrie offered it to Penn, which arranged for it to be moved to museum in 1913. The sphinx was moved in 2019 to a more prominent spot intended to attract visitors.[145]\n\n\nThe museum has three gallery floors with artifacts from Egypt, the Middle East, Mesoamerica, Asia, the Mediterranean, Africa and indigenous artifacts of the Americas.[143] Its most famous object is the goat rearing into the branches of a rosette-leafed plant, from the royal tombs of Ur.\n\n\nThe Penn Museum's excavations and collections foster a strong research base for graduate students in the Graduate Group in the Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World. Features of the Beaux-Arts building include a rotunda and gardens that include Egyptian papyrus.\n\n\n\n### Other Penn museums, galleries, and art collections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Institute of Contemporary Art, known as ICA, located just South of the Graduate Towers, the residence hall for graduate and professional students at the corner of 36th Street and Sansom Street\nPenn maintains a website providing a detailed roadmap to small museums and galleries and over one hundred locations across campus where the public can access Penn's over 8,000 artworks acquired over 250 years and includes, but is not limited to, paintings, sculptures, photography, works on paper, and decorative arts.[146] The largest of the art galleries is the Institute of Contemporary Art, one of the only kunsthalles in the country, which showcases various art exhibitions throughout the year. Since 1983 the Arthur Ross Gallery, located at the Fisher Fine Arts Library, has housed Penn's art collection[147] and is named for its benefactor, philanthropist Arthur Ross.\n\n\n\n### Residences[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Pennsylvania College Houses\n\nEvery College House at the University of Pennsylvania has at least four members of faculty in the roles of House Dean, Faculty Master, and College House Fellows.[148] Within the College Houses, Penn has nearly 40 themed residential programs for students with shared interests such as world cinema or science and technology. Many of the nearby homes and apartments in the area surrounding the campus are often rented by undergraduate students moving off campus after their first year, as well as by graduate and professional students.\n\n\nThe College Houses include W.E.B. Du Bois, Fisher Hassenfeld, Gregory, Gutmann, Harnwell, Harrison, Hill College House, Kings Court English, Lauder, Riepe, Rodin, Stouffer, and Ware. The first College House was Van Pelt College House, established in the fall of 1971. It was later renamed Gregory House.[149] Fisher Hassenfeld, Ware and Riepe together make up one building called \"The Quad\". The latest College House to be built is Guttman[150] (formerly named New College House West), which opened in the fall of 2021.[151]\n\n\nPenn students in Junior or Senior year may live in the 45 sororities and fraternities governed by three student-run governing councils, Interfraternity Council,[152] Intercultural Greek Council, and Panhellenic Council.[153]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nThe university's first purpose-built dormitory in the foreground (on right), built in 1765[154]\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Upper Quad, originally called The Triangle,[155] and formerly \"The Men's Dormitory\", viewed from the Memorial Tower[156]\n* ![](image)\n\nWoodland Walk pathway between Hill College House and Lauder College House\n* ![](image)\n\nHill College House, a dormitory designed in 1958 to house female students, was designed by Eero Saarinen\n* ![](image)\n\n\"The Quad\", formerly known as the Men's Dormitory, in 2014\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house, built by George W.

All officers are sworn municipal police officers and retain general law enforcement authority while on the campus.[157]\n\n\n\n## Academics and interdisciplinary focus[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania graduate and professional schools[158]\n| School\n | Year founded\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Perelman School of Medicine | 1765[159] |\n| School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1852[160] |\n| Law School | 1850[note 11] |\n| School of Design | 1868\n |\n| School of Dental Medicine | 1878[162] |\n| The Wharton School | 1881[163] |\n| Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1755[164] |\n| School of Veterinary Medicine | 1884[165] |\n| School of Social Policy and Practice | 1908\n |\n| Graduate School of Education | 1915\n |\n| School of Nursing | 1935\n |\n| Annenberg School for Communication | 1958\n |\n\n\nPenn's \"One University Policy\" allows students to enroll in classes in any of Penn's twelve schools.[166] The College of Arts and Sciences is the undergraduate division of the School of Arts and Sciences. The School of Arts and Sciences also contains the Graduate Division and the College of Liberal and Professional Studies, which is home to the Fels Institute of Government, the master's programs in Organizational Dynamics, and the Environmental Studies (MES) program. Wharton is the business school of the University of Pennsylvania. Other schools with undergraduate programs include the School of Nursing and the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS).\n\n\nPenn has a strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and research. It offers double degree programs, unique majors, and academic flexibility. Penn's \"One University\" policy allows undergraduates access to courses at all of Penn's undergraduate and graduate schools except the medical, veterinary and dental schools. Undergraduates at Penn may also take courses at Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and Swarthmore under a reciprocal agreement known as the Quaker Consortium.\n\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admissions to the University of Pennsylvania is considered by *US News* to be \"most selective\". Admissions officials consider a student's GPA to be a very important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation.[167] Admission is need-blind for U.S., Canadian, and Mexican applicants.[168]\n\n\nFor the class of 2026, entering in Fall 2022, the university received 54,588 applications.[169] *The Atlantic* also ranked Penn among the 10 most selective schools in the country. At the graduate level, based on admission statistics from *U.S. News & World Report*, Penn's most selective programs include its law school, the health care schools (medicine, dental medicine, nursing, veterinary), and Wharton business school.\n\n\n\n\n\nFall first-year statistics, by year\n|  | 2022[170] | 2019[171] | 2018[172] | 2017[173] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Applicants\n | 54,588\n | 44,961\n | 44,491\n | 40,413\n |\n| Admits\n | 3,404\n | 3,446\n | 3,740\n | 3,757\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 6.24%\n | 7.66%\n | 8.41%\n | 9.30%\n |\n| Enrolled\n | 2,417\n | 2,400\n | 2,518\n | 2,456\n |\n| Yield | 68.18%\n | 69.65%\n | 67.33%\n | 65.37%\n |\n| SAT range\\*\n | 1510–1560\n | 1450–1560\n | 1440–1560\n | 1420–1560\n |\n| ACT range\\*\n | 34–36\n | 33–35\n | 32–35\n | 32–35\n |\n\n\n\\* SAT and ACT ranges are from the 25th to the 75th percentile.\n\n\n\n### Coordinated dual-degree, accelerated, interdisciplinary programs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Smith Walk with a view of Towne Building and the Engineering Quad\nPenn offers unique and specialized coordinated dual-degree (CDD) programs, which selectively award candidates degrees from multiple schools at the university upon completion of graduation criteria of both schools in addition to program-specific programs and senior capstone projects. Additionally, there are accelerated and interdisciplinary programs offered by the university. These undergraduate programs include:\n\n\n\n* Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business[174]\n* Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology (M&T)[175]\n* Roy and Diana Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management (LSM)[176]\n* Nursing and Health Care Management (NHCM)[177]\n* Roy and Diana Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER)[178]\n* Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences (MLS)[179]\n* Singh Program in Networked and Social Systems Engineering (NETS)[180]\n* Digital Media Design (DMD)[181]\n* Computer and Cognitive Science: Artificial Intelligence[182]\n* Accelerated 7-Year Bio-Dental Program[183]\n* Accelerated 6-Year Law and Medicine Program[184]\n\n\nDual-degree programs that lead to the same multiple degrees without participation in the specific above programs are also available. Unlike CDD programs, \"dual degree\" students fulfill requirements of both programs independently without the involvement of another program. Specialized dual-degree programs include Liberal Studies and Technology as well as an Artificial Intelligence: Computer and Cognitive Science Program. Both programs award a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Also, the Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences allows its students to either double major in the sciences or submatriculate and earn both a BA and an MS in four years. The most recent Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER) was first offered for the class of 2016. A joint program of Penn's School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, VIPER leads to dual Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees by combining majors from each school.\n\n\nFor graduate programs, Penn offers many formalized double degree graduate degrees such as a joint J.D./MBA and maintains a list of interdisciplinary institutions, such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, and the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science.\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice, commonly known as Penn SP2, is a school of social policy and social work that offers degrees in a variety of subfields, in addition to several dual degree programs and sub-matriculation programs.[185][186][187] Penn SP2's vision is: \"The passionate pursuit of social innovation, impact and justice.\"[188]\n\n\nOriginally named the School of Social Work, SP2 was founded in 1908 and is a graduate school of the University of Pennsylvania. The school specializes in research, education, and policy development in relation to both social and economic issues.[189][190]\n\n\nThe School of Veterinary Medicine offers five dual-degree programs, combining the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (VMD) with a Master of Social Work (MSW), Master of Environmental Studies (MES), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Master of Public Health (MPH) or Masters in Business Administration (MBA) degree. The Penn Vet dual-degree programs are meant to support veterinarians planning to engage in interdisciplinary work in the areas of human health, environmental health, and animal health and welfare.[191]\n\n\n\n### Academic medical center and biomedical research complex[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founded in 1751 by Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Bond, Pennsylvania Hospital is now part of University of Pennsylvania Health System and is the earliest established hospital in the United States with the country's oldest surgical amphitheater.\nIn 2018, the university's nursing school was ranked number one by Quacquarelli Symonds.[192] That year, Quacquarelli Symonds also ranked Penn's school of Veterinary Medicine sixth.[193] In 2019, the Perelman School of Medicine was named the third-best medical school for research in *U.S. News & World Report's* 2020 ranking.[194]\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania Health System, also known as UPHS, is a multi-hospital health system headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned by Trustees of University of Pennsylvania. UPHS and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania together constitute **Penn Medicine**, a clinical and research entity of the University of Pennsylvania. UPHS hospitals include the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania,[195] Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, Pennsylvania Hospital, Chester County Hospital, Lancaster General Hospital, and Princeton Medical Center.[196] Penn Medicine owns and operates the first hospital in the United States, the Pennsylvania Hospital.[197] It is also home to America's first surgical amphitheatre[198] and its first medical library.[199]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Pennsylvania Hospital as painted by Pavel Svinyin in 1811\n* ![](image)\n\nPerelman School of Medicine\n* ![](image)\n\nPenn School of Dental Medicine\n* ![](image)\n\nHospital of the University of Pennsylvania (facing northwest towards front entrance)\n* ![](image)\n\nPenn owned Princeton Medical Center, eastern facade\n\n\n## Research and discoveries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer, was founded at Penn in 1946\n![](image)Claudia Cohen Hall, formerly Logan Hall, home of the College of Arts and Sciences and former home of the Wharton School and originally, the medical school\nPenn is classified as an \"R1\" doctoral university: \"Highest research activity.\"[200] Its economic impact on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for 2015 amounted to $14.3 billion.[201] Penn's research expenditures in the 2018 fiscal year were $1.442 billion, the fourth largest in the U.S.[202] In fiscal year 2019 Penn received $582.3 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health.[203]\n\n\nPenn's research centers often span two or more disciplines. In the 2010–2011 academic year, five interdisciplinary research centers were created or substantially expanded; these include the Center for Health-care Financing,[204] the Center for Global Women's Health at the Nursing School,[205] the $13 million Morris Arboretum's Horticulture Center,[206] the $15 million Jay H. Baker Retailing Center at Wharton[207] and the $13 million Translational Research Center at Penn Medicine.[208] With these additions, Penn now counts 165 research centers hosting a research community of over 4,300 faculty and over 1,100 postdoctoral fellows, 5,500 academic support staff and graduate student trainees.[8] To further assist the advancement of interdisciplinary research President Amy Gutmann established the \"Penn Integrates Knowledge\" title awarded to selected Penn professors \"whose research and teaching exemplify the integration of knowledge\".[209] These professors hold endowed professorships and joint appointments between Penn's schools.\n\n\nPenn is also among the most prolific producers of doctoral students. With 487 PhDs awarded in 2009, Penn ranks third in the Ivy League, only behind Columbia and Cornell (Harvard did not report data).[210] It also has one of the highest numbers of post-doctoral appointees (933 in number for 2004–2007), ranking third in the Ivy League (behind Harvard and Yale) and tenth nationally.[211]\n\n\nIn most disciplines Penn professors' productivity is among the highest in the nation and first in the fields of epidemiology, business, communication studies, comparative literature, languages, information science, criminal justice and criminology, social sciences and sociology.[212] According to the National Research Council nearly three-quarters of Penn's 41 assessed programs were placed in ranges including the top 10 rankings in their fields, with more than half of these in ranges including the top five rankings in these fields.[213]\n\n\nPenn's research tradition has historically been complemented by innovations that shaped higher education. In addition to establishing the first medical school, the first university teaching hospital, the oldest continuously operating degree-granting program in chemical engineering,[214] the first business school, and the first student union, Penn was also the cradle of other significant developments.\n\n\nIn 1852, Penn Law was the first law school in the nation to publish a law journal still in existence (then called *The American Law Register,* now the *Penn Law Review*, one of the most cited law journals in the world).[215] Under the deanship of William Draper Lewis, the law school was also one of the first schools to emphasize legal teaching by full-time professors instead of practitioners, a system that is still followed today.[216]\n\n\nThe Wharton School was home to several pioneering developments in business education. It established the first research center in a business school in 1921 and the first center for entrepreneurship center in 1973[217] and it regularly introduced novel curricula for which *BusinessWeek* wrote, \"Wharton is on the crest of a wave of reinvention and change in management education\".[218][219] The university has also contributed major advancements in the fields of economics and management. Among the many discoveries are conjoint analysis, widely used as a predictive tool especially in market research, Simon Kuznets's method of measuring Gross National Product,[220] the Penn effect (the observation that consumer price levels in richer countries are systematically higher than in poorer ones) and the \"Wharton Model\"[221] developed by Nobel-laureate Lawrence Klein to measure and forecast economic activity. The idea behind Health Maintenance Organizations also belonged to Penn professor Robert Eilers, who put it into practice during then-President Nixon's health reform in the 1970s.[220]\n\n\nSeveral major scientific discoveries have also taken place at Penn. The university is probably best known as the place where the first general-purpose electronic computer (ENIAC) was born in 1946 at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering.[222] It was here also where the world's first spelling and grammar checkers were created, as well as the popular COBOL programming language.[222]\n\n\nPenn can also boast some of the most important discoveries in the field of medicine. The dialysis machine used as an artificial replacement for lost kidney function was conceived and devised out of a pressure cooker by William Inouye while he was still a student at Penn Med;[223] the Rubella and Hepatitis B vaccines were developed at Penn;[223] the discovery of cancer's link with genes, cognitive therapy, Retin-A (the cream used to treat acne), Resistin, the Philadelphia gene (linked to chronic myelogenous leukemia) and the technology behind PET Scans were all discovered by Penn Med researchers.[223] More recent gene research has led to the discovery of the (a) genes for fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation; (b) spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, a disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting; (c) Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the hands, feet and limbs;[223] and (d)\ngenetically engineered T cells used to treat lymphoblastic leukemia and refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma.[224][225] Another contribution to medicine was made by Ralph L. Brinster (Penn faculty member since 1965) who developed the scientific basis for in vitro fertilization and the transgenic mouse at Penn and was awarded the National Medal of Science in 2010.\n\n\nPenn professors Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa invented a conductive polymer process that earned them the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The theory of superconductivity was also partly developed at Penn, by then-faculty member John Robert Schrieffer (along with John Bardeen and Leon Cooper).\n\n\n\n## Academic profile and

the eighth best university in the world.[244] The Princeton Review included Penn in its Dream Colleges list in 2015.[245] As reported by *USA Today*, Penn was ranked first in the United States by College Factual for 2015.[246] In 2023, Penn was ranked as having the 7th happiest students in the United States (the highest in the Ivy League).[247][248]\n\n\nIn their 2021 edition, Penn was ranked tenth in the nation by QS (Quacquarelli Symonds).[249] In the 2020 edition, Penn was ranked 15th in the world by the *QS World University Rankings*[250] and in 2019, 17th by the *Academic Ranking of World Universities* (ARWU) and 12th by the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*. In 2019, it ranked 12th among the universities around the world by *SCImago Institutions Rankings*.[251] According to the 2015 ARWU ranking, Penn is also the eighth- and ninth-best university in the world for economics/business and social sciences studies, respectively.[252] University of Pennsylvania ranked 12th among 300 Best World Universities in 2012 compiled by Human Resources & Labor Review (HRLR) on Measurements of World's Top 300 Universities Graduates' Performance.[253]\n\n\nThe Center for Measuring University Performance places Penn in the first tier of the United States' top research universities (tied with Columbia, MIT and Stanford), based on research expenditures, faculty awards, PhD granted and other academic criteria.[254] Penn was also ranked 18th of all U.S. colleges and universities in terms of R&D expenditures in fiscal year 2013 by the National Science Foundation.[255] The High Impact Universities research performance index ranks Penn eighth in the world, whereas the 2010 Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities (published by the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan) ranks Penn 11th in the world for 2007,[256] 2008[257] and 2010[258] and ninth for 2009.[259]\n\n\nThe Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers measures universities' research productivity, research impact, and research excellence based on the scientific papers published by their academic staff. The SCImago Institutions Rankings World Report 2012, which ranks world universities, national institutions and academies in terms of research output, ranks Penn seventh nationally among U.S. universities (2nd in the Ivy League behind Harvard) and 28th in the world overall (the first being France's French National Centre for Scientific Research).[260]\n\n\nThe Mines ParisTech International Professional Ranking, which ranks universities on the basis of the number of alumni listed among CEOs in the 500 largest worldwide companies, ranks Penn 11th worldwide and second nationally behind Harvard.[261] According to a *U.S. News* article in 2010, Penn is tied for second (tied with Dartmouth College and Tufts University) for the number of undergraduate alumni who are current Fortune 100 CEOs.[262] *Forbes* ranked Penn 17th, based on a variety of criteria.[263] In 2022, Poets & Quants ranked the undergraduate Wharton business school as the top business school in the nation for the fifth year in a row.[264]\n\n\n\n#### Graduate and professional programs[edit]\n\n\nAmong its professional schools, the school of education was ranked number one in 2021 and Wharton School of Business was ranked number one in 2022,[265] the communication, dentistry, medicine, nursing, law and veterinary medicine schools rank in the top 5 nationally.[266] Penn's Law School was ranked number 4 in 2023[240] and Design school, and its School of Social Policy and Practice are ranked in the top 10[266]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nEthnic breakdown of enrollment\n| Ethnic enrollment,fall 2018[267] | Number (percentage)of undergraduates\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| African American | 715 (7.1%)\n |\n| Native American | 12 (0.1%)\n |\n| Asian American andPacific Islander | 2,084 (20.7%)\n |\n| Hispanic andLatino American | 1,044 (10.4%)\n |\n| White | 4,278 (42.6%)\n |\n| International | 1,261 (12.6%)\n |\n| Two or more races,non-Hispanic\n | 460 (4.6%)\n |\n| Unknown\n | 179 (1.8%)\n |\n| Total\n | 10,033 (100%)\n |\n\n\n### Demographics and diversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aaron Albert Mossell II, the first African American graduate of Penn Law School, at his 1888 graduation\n![](image)Julian Abele, the first African American graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Design\n![](image)Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, the first African American woman to receive a Ph.D. in economics in the United States\n![](image)Edgar Fahs Smith, University of Pennsylvania provost from 1911 through 1920\nJonathan and Philip Gayienquitioga, two brothers of the Mohawk Nation,[268] were recruited by Benjamin Franklin to attend the Academy of Philadelphia,[269] making them the first Native Americans at Penn when they enrolled in 1755.[270] Moses Levy, the first Jewish student, enrolled in 1769 (and was also elected Penn's first Jewish trustee in 1802, serving to 1826).[271] Joseph M. Urquiola (aka José María de Urquiola y Fernández de Zúñiga), School of Medicine class of 1829 was the first Latino (from Cuba)[272][273][274] and Auxencio Maria Pena, School of Medicine class of 1836, was the first South American (from Venezuela)[275] to graduate from Penn.\n\n\nWilliam Adger, James Brister, and Nathan Francis Mossell in 1879 were the first African Americans to enroll at Penn. Adger was the first African American to graduate from the college at Penn (1883),[276] and when Brister graduated from the School of Dental Medicine (Penn Dental) (class of 1881), he was the first African American to earn a degree at Penn.[277] Mossell was first African American to graduate from Penn Med (1882)[278] (and had a brother, Aaron Albert Mossell II who was the first African American graduate of University of Pennsylvania Law School (in 1888) and [279] niece, Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, Albert's daughter, who not only was first African American woman to graduate from Penn Law (in 1927) and be admitted to practice law in Pennsylvania, but prior to such noteworthy accomplishments was the first African American woman to earn a PhD in the United States (from Penn in 1922)).[280] Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander's uncle (via her mother's Tanner family), Lewis Baxter Moore, in 1896 became the first person of African descent to earn a doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania and only the fifth black person in the United States to earn a doctor of philosophy degree[281] and in 1899 founded the Teachers College (now known as the School of Education) of Howard University and served as its dean continuously from 1899 through September 1920.[282]\n\n\nTosui Imadate was the first person of Asian descent to graduate from Penn (College [283] Class of 1879).[284] In 1877, Imadate became the first Asian member of a fraternity at Penn when he became a brother at Phi Kappa Psi.[285] In a quote from a portion of a letter published in December 1880 issue of *The Crescent*, Imadate is described by a Phi Kappa Psi brother as a \"brother member of Penn's I [iota] chapter of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, who is a professor in college at Kiota [(Kyoto, Japan)]\".[286][287]\n\n\nFuji Tsukamoto, Penn Graduate School Class of 1889, became the first woman of Asian descent to matriculate at Penn when she started her study of biology and botany in 1885 and, like Tosui Imadate, also taught at Kyoto college in Japan.[288]\n\n\nMary Alice Bennett and Anna H. Johnson were in 1880 the first women to enroll in a Penn degree-granting program and Bennett was the first woman to receive a degree from Penn, which was a PhD.[289][290][272]\n\n\nJulian Abele in 1902 was the first African American to graduate from University of Pennsylvania School of Design (then named Department of Architecture) and was elected as the president of Penn's Architectural Society.[291] Abele won a 1901 student competition where he designed a Beaux Arts pedestrian gateway that was built and still stands on the campus of Haverford College,[292] The Edward B. Conklin Memorial Gate at the Railroad Avenue entrance to Haverford College.[293] Abele contributed to the design of more than 400 buildings, including the Widener Memorial Library at Harvard University (1912–1915), Philadelphia's Central Library (1917–1927),[294] and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1914–1928).[295] and was the primary designer of the west campus of Duke University (1924–1954).[296] Duke honored Abele by prominently displaying his portrait, the first portrait of an African American to be displayed on the campus.[297]\n\n\nSadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, paternal niece of Nathan Francis Mossell and maternal niece of Lewis Baxter Moore, was the first African American to receive a PhD in economics in the United States (and third black woman to earn one in the United States in any subject)[298] and first from Penn in 1921, the first African-American woman to receive a law degree from Penn Law in 1927, and the first African-American woman to practice law in Pennsylvania.[280]\n\n\nAlan L. Hart, who earned a master's degree at Penn Med in radiology (class of 1928),[299][note 12] was born in 1890 and publicly identified as a female, Alberta Lucille Hart, through much of 1917, the year Hart transitioned to being a man by having a hysterectomy, one of the first in the United States to be performed to help a person become a trans man, and lived the rest of his life as a man.[300] Hart, Penn's most prominent transgender alumnus in the first half of the twentieth century, was a pioneer in using x-ray photography to detect tuberculosis, allowing the identification of asymptomatic TB carriers (seventy-five percent of the total infected), permitting treatment of patients before they had complications, and allowing for separation of TB patients from others to stop the spread of one of the more infectious deadly diseases known to humanity.[299]\n\n\nThe first openly LGBTQ+ organization funded by Penn was formed in 1972 by Kiyoshi Kuromiya, a Benjamin Franklin Scholar and Penn alumnus from the College's class of 1966, when he created the Gay Coffee Hour, which met every week on campus and was also open to non-students and served as an alternative space to gay bars for gay people of all ages.[301] Penn funded the Gay Coffee House program (via a grant from the student government), which was held in Houston Hall at six o'clock in the evening every Wednesday and attracted, on average, roughly sixty people of all ages with roughly \"one-quarter to one-third women and two-thirds to three-quarters men.\"[302] In March 2023, Penn announced a first in the United States LGBTQ+ scholar in residence after a $2-million gift.[303]\n\n\nAs detailed in part above, by the first decades of the twentieth century, Penn made strides and took an active interest in attracting diverse students from around the globe. Two examples of such action occurred in 1910. Penn's first director of publicity, created a recruiting brochure, translated into Spanish, with approximately 10,000 copies circulated throughout Latin America. That same year, the Penn-affiliated organization, the Cosmopolitan Club, started an annual tradition of hosting an opening \"smoker\", which attracted students from 40 nations who were formally welcomed to the university by then-vice provost Edgar Fahs Smith (who the following year would start a ten-year tenure as provost)[304][305][306][307][308] who spoke about how Penn wanted to \"bring together students of different countries and break down misunderstandings existing between them\".[272]\n\n\nThe success of such efforts were reported in 1921 when the official Penn publicity department reported that\n\n\n\n\n> We have an enrollment at the University of 12,000 students, who have registered from every State in the Union, and 253 students from at least fifty foreign countries and foreign territories, including India, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and practically all the British possessions except Ireland; every Latin American country, and most of the Oriental and European nations.\n> \n> — George E. Nitzsche, 1921[84]\n> \n\n\nOf those accepted for admission in 2018, 48 percent were Asian, Hispanic, African-American or Native American.[8] Fourteen percent of entering undergraduates in 2018 were international students.[8] The composition of international first-year students in 2018 was: 46% from Asia; 15% from Africa and the Middle East; 16% from Europe; 14% from Canada and Mexico; 8% from the Caribbean, Central America and South America; 5% from Australia and the Pacific Islands.[8] The acceptance rate for international students admission in 2018 was 493 out of 8,316 (6.7%).[8] In 2018, 55% of all enrolled students were women.[8]\n\n\nIn the last few decades, Jewish enrollment has been declining. Circa 1999 about 28% of the students were Jewish.[309] In early 2020, 1,750 Penn undergraduate students were Jewish,[310] which would be approximately 17%[311] of the some 10,000 undergrads for 2019–20.\n\n\n\n### Penn Face and behavioral health[edit]\n\n\nThe university's social pressure surrounding academic perfection, extreme competitiveness, and nonguaranteed readmission have created what is known as \"Penn Face\": students put on a façade of confidence and happiness while enduring mental turmoil.[312][313][314][315][316] Stanford University calls this phenomenon \"Duck Syndrome.\"[315][317] In recent years, mental health has become an issue on campus with ten student suicides between the years of 2013 to 2016.[318] The school responded by launching a task force.[319][320] The most widely covered case of Penn Face has been Madison Holleran.[321][322] In 2018, initiatives were enacted to ameliorate mental health problems, such as requiring sophomores to live on campus and the daily closing of Huntsman Hall at 2:00 a.m.[323][324] The university's suicide rate was the catalyst for a 2018 state bill, introduced by Governor Tom Wolf, to raise Pennsylvania's standards for university suicide prevention.[325] The university's efforts to address mental health on campus came into the national spotlight again in September 2019 when the director of the university's counseling services died by suicide six months after starting the position.[326]\n\n\n\n### Selected student organizations[edit]\n\n\nOldest organization\n![](image)Philomathean Society graduation diploma For Isaac Norton Jr., 1858\n![](image)The Philomathean Society Presidential Library named after United States President and Penn Med alumnus William Henry Harrison\nThe Philomathean Society, founded in 1813, is one of the United States' oldest collegiate literary societies and continues to host lectures and intellectual events open to the public.[327]\n\n\n\n*The Daily Pennsylvanian*\nMain article: The Daily Pennsylvanian\n\n![](image)34th Street logo in 2017\n*The Daily Pennsylvanian* is an independent, student-run newspaper, which has been published daily since it was founded in 1885.[328] The newspaper went unpublished from May 1943 to November 1945 due to World War II.[328] In 1984, the university lost all editorial and financial control of *The Daily Pennsylvanian* (also known as *The DP*) when the newspaper became its own corporation.[328] *The Daily Pennsylvanian* has won the Pacemaker Award administered by the Associated Collegiate Press multiple times, most recently in 2019.[329][330] The *DP* also publishes a weekly arts and culture magazine called *34th Street Magazine*.\n\n\n*The Daily Pennsylvanian* also operates three principal websites, thedp.com, 34st.com, and underthebutton.com, and publishes opinion, news, and sports blogs. It has received various collegiate journalism awards.\n\n\n\nAcademic organizations\nSee also: Penn Debate Society and Penn History Review\n\nThe Penn Debate Society (PDS), founded in 1984 as the Penn Parliamentary Debate Society, is Penn's debate team, which competes regularly on the American Parliamentary Debate Association and the international British Parliamentary circuit.[331]\n\n\nThe *Penn History Review* is a journal, published twice a year, through the Department of History, for undergraduate historical research, by and for undergraduates, and founded in 1991.[332][333][334]\n\n\n\nLGBTQ+ organizations\nPenn has been ranked as the number one LGBTQ+ friendly school in the country.[335] Penn's LGBTQ+ center is second oldest in the nation[336] and oldest in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as it has been serving the LGBTQ+ community since 1979 by providing support and guidance through 25 groups (including Penn J-Bagel a Jewish LGBTQ+ group, the Lambda Alliance a general LGBTQ social organization, and oSTEM a group for LGBTQ people in STEM fields).[337] Penn offers courses in Sexuality and Gender Studies which allows students to discover and learn queer theory, history of sexual norms, and other gender orientation related courses.[338] The first Penn funded LGBTQ+ organization was formed in 1972 by \"Steve\" Kiyoshi Kuromiya (Penn college class of 1966) when he created the Gay Coffee Hour, which met every week on campus and served as an alternative space to gay bars for gay people of all ages.[301] Penn funded the Gay Coffee House via a grant from the student government and the weekly event was held in Houston Hall Wednesday evenings.[302]\n\n\n\n#### Penn Electric Racing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn Electric Racing unveiled REV8 on March 31, 2023, in front of the Benjamin Franklin statue in front of College Hall.\nPenn Electric Racing is the university's Formula SAE (FSAE) team, competing in the international electric vehicle (EV) competition.

The Performing Arts Council (PAC) oversees 45 student organizations in these areas.[347] The PAC has four subcommittees: A Cappella Council; Dance Arts Council; Singer, Musicians, and Comedians (SMAC); and Theatre Arts Council (TAC-e).\n\n\n\n#### Penn Glee Club[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn Glee Club's 1915–1916 academic year membership photo\nThe University of Pennsylvania Glee Club, founded in 1862, is tied for fourth oldest continually running glee clubs in the United States[348] and the oldest performing arts group at the University of Pennsylvania. Each year, the Penn Glee Club writes and produces a fully staged, Broadway-style production with an eclectic mix of Penn standards, Broadway classics, classical favorites, and pop hits, highlighting choral singing from all genders (as of April 9, 2021, it merged[349] with Penn Sirens, a previously all female chorale group), clever plots and dialogue, dancing, humor, colorful sets and costumes, and a pit band.[350] The Glee Club draws its singing members from the undergraduate and graduate students (and men and women from the Penn community are also called upon to fill roles in the pit band and technical staff when the club is involved with theatrical productions). The Penn Glee Club has traveled to nearly all 50 states in the United States and over 40 nations and territories on five continents.[351] Since the 1950s, Penn Glee Club has appeared on national television with such celebrities as Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Stewart, Ed McMahon, Carol Lawrence, and Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco and has been showcased on television specials such as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and at professional sporting events for The Philadelphia Phillies where club sung the National Anthem at the 1993 National League Championship Series. Since its first performance at the White House for President Calvin Coolidge in 1926, the club has sung for numerous heads of state and world leaders. One of the highlights of 1989 was the club's performance for Polish President Lech Wałęsa. Bruce Montgomery, its best-known and longest-serving director, led the club from 1956 until 2000.[352]\n\n\n\n#### Penn Band[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The University of Pennsylvania Band\n\n![](image)The University of Pennsylvania Band at the 2019 homecoming game\nThe University of Pennsylvania Band has been a part of student life since 1897.[353] The Penn Band presently mainly performs at football and basketball games as well as university functions (e.g. commencement and convocation) throughout the year but in past it was known not only as the first college band to perform at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade but performed with notable musicians, including John Philip Sousa, members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, the U.S. Marine Band (\"The President's Own\"), Doc Severinsen of *The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson*. Beginning in the late 1920s and 1930s Penn Band recorded with the Victor Talking Machine Company (RCA-Victor Company) and was nationally broadcast on WABC (AM). In 1977, Penn Band performed with Chuck Barris of The Gong Show and in 1980 opened for Penn alumnus Maury Povich in his eponymously named show.\n\n\nPenn Band has performed for Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco (sister and aunt to number of alumni), alumnus and District Attorney and Mayor of Philadelphia, and Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell, Vice President Al Gore, Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson and Ronald Reagan, and Polish dissident and President Lech Wałęsa. By the 1970s, however, Penn Band had begun moving away from the traditional corps style and is now a scramble band. The first one hundred years of the organization's history was described in a book from Arcadia Publishing: *Images of America:The University of Pennsylvania Band* (2006).[353]\n\n\n\n#### Penn's a cappella community[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn Masala performs in the Blue Room of the White House in October 2009 on invitation from President Barack Obama.\nThe A Cappella Council (ACK) is composed of 14 a cappella groups. Penn's a cappella groups entertain audiences with repertoires including pop, rock, R&B, jazz, Hindi, and Chinese songs.[354]\nACK is also home to Off The Beat, which has received the most contemporary a cappella recording awards of any collegiate group in the United States and the most features on the *Best of College A Cappella* albums.[355] Penn Masala, formed in 1996, is world's oldest[356][357] and premier[358][359] South Asian a cappella group based in an American university, which has performed for Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Henry Kissinger, Ban Ki Moon, Farooq Abdullah, Imran Khan, Rajkumar Hirani, A.R. Rahman, Narendra Modi[360] and Sunidhi Chauhan, had their a cappella version of Nazia Hassan's Urdu classic \"Aap Jaisa Koi\", (originally from the movie *Qurbani*) sung in the movie American Desi.[361]\n\n\nPenn alumni Elizabeth Banks (class of 1996) and Max Handelman (Banks' husband, class of 1995) invited Masala to appear in *Pitch Perfect 2*, as Banks reported that Penn's a capella community inspired the film series starring and/or produced by Banks and Handleman.[362]\n\n\n\n#### Comedy organizations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mask and Wig clubhouse, also known as the Welsh Coachhouse and Stable, at 310 South Quince Street in Philadelphia; the stable was built between 1843 and 1853, remodeled into a clubhouse by Wilson Eyre Jr. in 1894, altered by Eyre in 1901. The murals were developed by Maxfield Parrish.\nMask and Wig, a club founded in 1889, was (until fall of 2021[363]) the oldest all-male musical comedy troupe in the country. In 2021 the club voted to become gender-inclusive, with auditions open to all undergraduates: male, female, and non-binary.\n\n\nBloomers comedy group, founded in 1978, is the \"... nation's first collegiate all-women musical and sketch comedy troupe...\".[364]\nBloomers was founded at Penn by Joan Harrison.[365] In the mid teens, Bloomers revised its constitution to be open to \"... anyone who does not identify as a cisgender man...\".[366] \nand now accepts all persons from under-represented gender identities who perform comedy.[367][368] Bloomers performs sketches and elaborate shows almost every semester. The comedy troupe is named after bloomers, the once popular long, loose fitting under garment, gathered at the ankle, worn under a short skirt (developed in the mid 19th century as a healthy comfortable alternative to the heavy, constricting dresses then worn by American women), which were in turn, named after Amelia Jenks Bloomer. Bloomers most well known performing alumna is Vanessa Bayer, formerly of Saturday Night Live and is SNL's longest-serving female cast member.[369]\n\n\n\n### Religious and spiritual organizations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains academic boosterism which primarily serves to praise or promote the subject** and may be a sign of a conflict of interest. Please improve this article by removing peacock terms, weasel words, and other promotional material. *(July 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe following religious and spiritual organizations have a significant on campus presence at Penn:\n\n\n(A) Mainstream Protestantism:\nDating back to 1857, The Christian Association (a.k.a. The CA), is composed primarily of students from Mainline Protestant backgrounds.[370] Historically, the CA ran several foreign missions including one in China[371] and for decades ran a camp for socio-economically disadvantaged children from Philadelphia.[372] At present the CA occupies part of the parsonage at Tabernacle United Church of Christ.[373]\n\n\n(B) Judaism:\nOrganized Jewish life did not begin on campus in earnest until the start of 20th century.[374] Jewish Life on campus is centered at Penn branch of Hillel International,[375][311] which inspires students to explore Judaism, creates patterns of Jewish living that can be sustained after graduation, provides religious communities, promotes educational initiatives, social justice projects, social and cultural opportunities, and groups focusing on Israel education and politics, and hosts a Kosher Penn approved dining hall (supervised by the Community Kashrus of Greater Philadelphia).[376] In addition to Hillel, the other major Jewish organization with significant impact on Penn's campus is The Chabad Lubavitch House at Penn (founded in 1980[377]), which, among other activities, brings together Jewish college students with noted Jewish academics for in-depth discussions and debate.[378]\n\n\n(C) Roman Catholicism:\nThe Penn Newman Catholic Center (the Newman Center), founded in 1893 (as the first Newman Center in the country) with the mission of supporting students, faculty, and staff in their religious endeavors. The organization brings prominent Christian figures to campus, including Rev. Thomas \"Tom\" J. Hagan, OSFS, who worked in the Newman Center and founded Haiti-based non-profit Hands Together;[379] and James Martin SJ (Wharton undergraduate class of 1982[380]). Father Martin, an editor-at-large of the Jesuit magazine *America*,[381] and frequent commentator on the life and teachings of Jesus and Ignatian spirituality, is especially well known for his outreach to the LGBT community, which has drawn a strong backlash from parts of the Catholic Church, but has provided comfort to Penn students and other members of Roman Catholic community who wish to stay connected with their faith and identify as LGBQT.[382][383][384]\n\n\n(D) Hinduism and Jainism:\nPenn funds (via the Graduate and Professional Student Assembly or similar undergraduate organization) a variety of official clubs focused on India including a number focused on students who are Hindu or Jain such as: (1) 'Pan-Asian American Community House (PAACH)', a center for students to celebrate South Asian, East Asian, Southeast Asian, culture and religion,[385] (2) 'Rangoli – The South Asian Association at Penn' that educates and informs Penn students (mainly graduate and professional students) with ancestry and/or interest in South Asia whose goals include a desire to \"rekindle the spirit of community\" through events,[386] and (3) 'Penn Hindu & Jain Association', a student-run official club at Penn that has 80 to 110 student members and an extensive alumni network, dedicated to raise awareness of the Hindu and Jain faiths and foster further development of these communities in the greater Philadelphia area by providing a variety of services and hosting a number of events such as Holi Festival (which has been held annually at Penn since 1993[387][388][389]) and \". . . aims to be a home to anyone seeking to explore their spiritual, religious, or social interests.\"[390]\n\n\n(E) Islam:\nIn 1963, the Muslim Students' Association (MSA National) and Penn chapter of MSA National were founded to facilitate Muslim life among students on college campuses.[391][392] Penn MSA was established to help Penn Muslims build faith and community by fostering a space under the guidance of Islamic principles[393][394] and towards that goal Penn MSA supports mission of its related umbrella organization, Islamic Society of North America, to \"foster the development of the Muslim community, interfaith relations, civic engagement, and better understandings of Islam.\"[395] The Muslim Life Program at Penn also provides such support and helped cause Penn (in January 2017) to hire its first full-time Muslim chaplain, the co-president of the Association of Campus Muslim Chaplains, Sister Patricia Anton (whose background includes working with Muslim, interfaith, academic and peace-building institutions such as Islamic Society of North America and Islamic Relief). Chaplain Anton's mandate includes supporting and guiding the Penn Muslim community to foster further development of such community by creating a welcoming environment that provides Penn Muslim community opportunities to intellectually and spiritually engage with Islam.[396] Penn also has a residential house, the Muslim Life Residential Program, which provides a live/learn environment focused on the appreciation of Islamic culture, food, history, and practice, and shows its Penn student residents how Islam is deeply integrated in the culture of Philadelphia so they may appreciate how Islam influences daily life.[397]\n\n\n(F) Buddhism:\nPenn has a Buddhist chaplain[398][399] (as well as chaplains of other faiths) and funds the Penn Meditation and Buddhism Club, which (1) is dedicated to helping Penn students practice mindfulness and meditation and learning about Buddhism, (2) conducts weekly meetings that begin with a guided meditation and are followed by discussions of topic(s) relating to mindfulness and Buddhism, and (3) organizes other activities such as ramen nights and weekend meditation retreats to the local Won Buddhism center.[400]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers\n\nPenn's sports teams are nicknamed the Quakers, but the teams are often also referred to as The Red and Blue as reflected in the popular song sung after every athletic contest where the Penn Band or other musical groups are present.[401][402] The athletes participate in the Ivy League and Division I (Division I FCS for football) in the NCAA. In recent decades, they often have been league champions in football (14 times from 1982 to 2010) and basketball (22 times from 1970 to 2006). The first athletic team at Penn was the cricket team, which formed in 1842 and played regularly through 1846, the year it lost its \"grounds\", and then only played intermittently until 1864, the year it played its first intercollegiate game (against Haverford College).[403] The rowing (or crew) team composed of Penn students but not officially representing Penn was formed in 1854 but did not compete against other colleges as official part of Penn until 1879. The rugby football team began to play against other colleges, most notably against College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1874 using a combination of association football (i.e. soccer) and rugby rules (the twenty players on each side were able to use their hands but were not able to pass or bat the ball forward).[404][405][406]\n\n\n\n### Cricket[edit]\n\n\nThe first University of Pennsylvania cricket team, reported to be the first cricket team in the United States composed exclusively of Americans,[407] was organized in 1842 by a member of Philadelphia's prominent Wister family, William Rotch Wister (class of 1846 for Bachelor of Arts and 1849 for Master of Arts).[408] Penn never possessed its own \"ground\" except in 1846 when it leased one day a week, for a total sum of $50, a \"ground\" (located east of the Delaware River).[409][note 13] From 1846 to 1860, there is little evidence of Penn playing cricket but just as Civil War began, Penn students resumed playing cricket matches between classes of Penn students.\n\n\nOn May 7, 1864, Penn played its first intercollegiate game against Haverford College[410][411] and then proceeded to play Haverford for three consecutive years until 1869, when the Haverford faculty banned cricket away from their college grounds.\n\n\nAfter Penn moved west of the Schuylkill River in 1872, Penn played cricket at one of the local clubs (Belmont Cricket Club, the closest to campus at 50th Street and Chester Avenue, Merion Cricket Club, and Germantown Cricket Club), or at Haverford College.[410] Though there is evidence of an occasional game during period 1870 through 1875, none were played against other colleges and there were no yearbook pictures for the three years after 1872 when Penn moved from Center City to University City. Starting in 1875 and through 1880, Penn fielded a varsity eleven, which played a few matches each year against opponents that included Haverford College and Columbia College.[412]\n\n\n\n![](image)George Patterson, president of the University of Pennsylvania cricket team in 1877[410]\nIn 1881, Penn, Harvard College, Haverford College, Princeton College (then known as College of New Jersey), and Columbia College formed The Intercollegiate Cricket Association,[411] which Cornell University later joined.[403] Penn won The Intercollegiate Cricket Association championship (the *de facto* national championship) 23 times (18 solo, 3 shared with Haverford and Harvard, 1 shared with Haverford and Cornell, and 1 shared with just Haverford) during the 44 years that The Intercollegiate Cricket Association existed (1881 through 1924).[413]\n\n\nIn the 1890s Penn's cricket team frequently toured Canada and the British Isles.[414] In July 1895 an international cricket match between Canada and the United States was played on the Manheim grounds in Germantown section of Philadelphia with six of the United States team being Penn student athletes and, in September of that year, past and then current members of Penn's varsity cricket team played past and then current members of the English cricket teams of Oxford and Cambridge resulting in Penn defeating the Oxford-Cambridge team by one hundred runs.[403] This was not surprising as in the last two and a half decades of the 19th century and first decade of the 20th century, Philadelphia was the center of cricket in the United States[415]\n\n\nCricket had gained in popularity among the upper class from their travels abroad and cricket clubs sprung up all across the Eastern Seaboard (even today Philadelphia still has three cricket clubs: the Philadelphia Cricket Club, the Merion Cricket Club, and the Germantown Cricket Club).\n\n\nPerhaps the university's most famous cricket player was George Patterson (class of 1888), who still holds the North American batting record and who went on to play for the professional Philadelphia Cricket Team.[416]\n\n\nFollowing the First World War, cricket began to experience a serious decline (as baseball became the preferred sport of the warmer months and Imperial Cricket Conference, Cricket's \"... international governing body and forerunner to the current International Cricket Conference (ICC), introduced a regulation making it clear that only countries within the British empire were welcome to compete\")[409] such that in 1924 Penn fielded its last team in the twentieth century. Starting in 2009, however, Penn once again fielded a cricket team, albeit club, that ended up being the first winner of a tournament for teams from the Ivies.[417]\n\n\n\n### Rowing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn's eight-oared crew in 1901, the first foreign crew to reach the final of the Grand Challenge Cup[418] at Henley Royal Regatta\n![](image)Joe Burk, Wharton School class of 1934 and crew coach from 1950 to 1969, was named the \"world's greatest oarsman\" in 1938[419]\nRowing at Penn dates back to at least 1854 with the founding of the University Barge Club. The university currently hosts both heavyweight and lightweight men's teams and an open weight women's team, all of which compete as part of the Eastern Sprints League. Ellis Ward was Penn's first intercollegiate crew coach from 1879 through 1912.[420] During the course of Ward's coaching career at Penn his \"... Red and Blue crews won 65 races, in about 150 starts.\"[421] Importantly, Ward coached Penn's 8-oared boat to the finals of the Grand Challenge Cup (the oldest and most prized trophy) at the Henley Royal Regatta (but in that final race was defeated by the champion Leander Club).[422]\n\n\nPenn Rowing has produced a long list of famous coaches and Olympians. Members of Penn crew team, rowers Sidney Jellinek, Eddie Mitchell, and coxswain, John G. Kennedy, won the bronze medal for the United States at 1924 Olympics.[423]\n\n\nJoe Burk (class of 1935) was captain of Penn crew team, winner of the Henley Diamond Sculls twice, named recipient of the James E. Sullivan Award for nation's best amateur athlete in 1939, and Penn coach from 1950 to 1969. The 1955 Men's Heavyweight 8, coached by Joe Burk, became one of only four American university crews in history to win the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. The outbreak of World War Two canceled the 1940 Olympics for which Burk was favored to win the gold medal.\n\n\nOther Penn Olympic athletes and or Penn coaches of such athletes include:\n(a) John Anthony Pescatore (who competed in the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games for the United States as stroke of the men's coxed eight which earned a bronze medal[424] and later competed at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games in the men's coxless pair),\n(b) Susan Francia (winner of gold medals as part of the women's 8 oared boat at 2008 Olympics and 2012 Olympics),\n(c) Regina Salmons (member of 2021 USA team),[425] \n(d) Rusty Callow, \n(e) Harry Parker,\n(f) Ted Nash,[423] and\n(g) John B. Kelly Jr., son of John B. Kelly Sr. (winner of three medals at 1920 Summer Olympics) and brother of Princess Grace of Monaco, was the second Penn Crew alumnus to win the James E. Sullivan Award[426] for being nation's best amateur athlete (in 1947), who was winner of a bronze medal at the 1956 Summer Olympics).\n\n\nThe Penn men's crew team won the National Collegiate Rowing Championship in 1991. A member of that team, Janusz Hooker (Wharton class of 1992)[427] won the bronze medal in Men's Quadruple Sculls for Australia at the 1996 Summer Olympics.[428] The Penn teams presently row out of College Boat Club, No.11 Boathouse Row.\n\n\n\n### Rugby[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 1878 Penn Rugby team[429]\n![](image)John Heisman, a University of Pennsylvania Law School class of 1892 alumnus and rugby football player, posing at Penn in 1891 holding elongated ellipsoidal rugby ball and gestures resembling the famed \"Heisman Pose\"[430]\n![](image)Lithograph of University of Pennsylvania rugby player in 1907\nThe Penn men's rugby football team is one of the oldest collegiate rugby teams in the United States. Indeed, Penn first fielded a team in mid-1870s playing by rules much closer to the rugby union and Association football code rules (relative to American football rules, as such American football rules had not yet been invented[404]). Among its earliest games was a game against College of New Jersey (which in 1895 changed its name to Princeton) played in Philadelphia on Saturday, November 11, 1876, which was less than two weeks before Princeton met on November 23, 1876, with Harvard and Columbia to confirm that all their games would be played using the rugby union rules.[431][404] Princeton and Penn played their November 1876 game per a combination of rugby (there were 20 players per side and players were able to touch the ball with their hands) and Association football codes. The rugby code influence was due, in part, to the fact that some of their students had been educated in English public schools.[432]\n\n\nAmong the prominent alumni to play in a 19th century version of rugby in which rules then did not allow forward passes or center snaps was John Heisman, namesake of the Heisman Trophy and an 1892 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[433]\n\n\nHeisman was instrumental in the first decade of the 20th century in changing the rules to more closely relate to the present rules of American football.[434] One of Heisman's teammates (who was unanimously voted Captain in the fall after Heisman graduated) was Harry Arista Mackey, Penn Law class of 1893[435] (who subsequently served as Mayor of Philadelphia from 1928 to 1932).[436]\n\n\nIn 1906, Rugby per Rugby Union code was reintroduced to Penn[437] (as Penn last played per Rugby Union Code in 1882 as Penn played rugby per a number of different rugby football rulebooks and codes from 1883 through 1890s[438]) by Frank Villeneuve Nicholson (Frank Nicholson (rugby union)) University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine (class of 1910),[439] who in 1904 had captained the Australian national rugby team in its match against England.[440]\n\n\n\nPenn played per rugby union code rules at least through 1912, contemporaneously with Penn playing American gridiron football. Evidence of such may be found in an October 22, 1910, *Daily Pennsylvanian* article (quoted below) and a yearbook photo[441] that rugby per rugby union code was played.\n\n\n> Such is the devotion to English rugby football on the part of University of Pennsylvania's students from New Zealand, Australia, and England that they meet on Franklin Field at 7 o'clock every morning and practice the game. The varsity track and football squads monopolize the field to such an extent that the early hours of the morning are the only ones during which the rugby enthusiasts can play. Any time except Friday, Saturday and Sunday, a squad of 25 men may be seen running through the hardest kind of practice after which they may divide into two teams and play a hard game. Once a week, captain CC Walton, ('11), dental, who hails from New Zealand, gives the enthusiastic players a blackboard talk in which he explains the intricacies of the game in detail.[442]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe player-coach of United States Olympic gold-winning rugby team at the 1924 Summer Olympics was Alan Valentine, who played rugby while at Penn (which he attended during 1921/1922 academic year) as he was getting a master's degree at Wharton.[443]\n\n\nThough Penn played rugby per rugby union rules from 1929 through 1934,[444] there is no indication that Penn had a rugby team from 1935 through 1959 when Penn men's rugby became permanent due to leadership of Harry \"Joe\" Edwin Reagan III[445] Penn's College class of 1962 and Penn Law class of 1965, who also went onto help create and incorporate (in 1975) and was Treasurer (in 1981) of USA Rugby and Oreste P. \"Rusty\" D'Arconte Penn's College class of 1966[446] Thus, with D'Arconte's hustle and Reagan's charisma and organizational skills, a team, which had fielded a side of fifteen intermittently from 1912 through 1960, became permanent.\n\n\nIn spring of 1984[447][448] Penn women's rugby, led by Social Chair Tamara Wayland (College class of 1985 who subsequently became the women's representative to and vice president of USA Rugby South from 1996 to 1998),[449] Club President Marianne Seligson, and Penn Law student Gigi Sohn,[450] began to compete. Penn women's rugby team is coached, as of 2020, by (a) Adam Dick,[451] a 300-level certified coach with over 15 years of rugby coaching experience including being the first coach of the first women's rugby team at the University of Arizona and who was a four-year starter at University of Arizona men's first XV rugby team and (b) Philly women's player Kate Hallinan.\n\n\nPenn's men's rugby team plays in the Ivy Rugby Conference[452] and have finished as runners-up in both 15s and 7s in the Conference and won the Ivy Rugby Tournament in 1992.[453] As of 2011[update], the club uses the state-of-the-art facilities at Penn Park. The Penn Quakers' rugby team played on national TV at the 2013 Collegiate Rugby Championship, a college rugby tournament that for number of years had been played each June at PPL Park (now known as Subaru Park) in Philadelphia and was broadcast live on NBC. In their inaugural year of participation, the Penn men's rugby team won the Shield Competition, beating local Big Five rival, Temple University, 17–12 in the final. In the semifinal match of that Shield Competition, Penn Rugby became the first Philadelphia team to beat a non-Philadelphia team in CRC history, with a 14–12 win over the University of Texas.[454]\n\n\nPenn men's rugby, as of 2020,[455] is coached by Tiger Bax,[456] a former professional rugby player hailing from Cape Town, South Africa, whose playing experience includes stints in the Super Rugby competition with the Stormers (15s) and Mighty Mohicans (7s), as well as with the Gallagher Premiership Rugby side, Saracens[457] and whose coaching experience includes three successful years as coach at Valley Rugby Football Club in Hong Kong; and Tyler May, from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, who played rugby at Pennsylvania State University where he was a first XV player for three years.\n\n\nPlayers on the 2019 men's team came from 11 countries: Australia, Botswana, Chile, Great Britain, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, China, Taiwan, South Africa, and the United States).\n\n\nPenn's graduate business and law schools also fielded rugby teams. The Wharton rugby team has competed from 1978 to the present.[458] The Penn Law Rugby team (1985 through 1993) counts among its alumni Walter Joseph Jay Clayton, III[459] Penn Law class of 1993, and chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from May 4, 2017, until December 23, 2020, Raymond Hulser, former Chief of Public Integrity Section of United States Department of Justice,[460] and Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart[461] who approved the search of Mar-a-Lago, the residence of former U.S. president Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.[462] Other recent Penn Rugby Alumni include Conor Lamb (Penn College class of 2006 and Penn Law class of 2009), who played for undergraduate team (and had an additional year of eligibility allowing him to continue to playing for undergraduate team while a student at Penn Law per USA Rugby rules), and, as of 2021, is a member of United States House of Representatives, elected originally to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, since 2019 is a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district.\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers football\n\n![](image)Chuck Bednarik, also known as Concrete Charlie was a three-time All-American at Penn who was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, the first player selected in the 1949 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles, where he went on to win the 1960 NFL Championship and was inducted into Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nPenn first fielded a football team against Princeton at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia on November 11, 1876.[431]\n\n\nPenn football made many contributions to the sport in its early days. During the 1890s, Penn's famed coach and alumnus George Washington Woodruff introduced the quarterback kick, a forerunner of the forward pass, as well as the place-kick from scrimmage and the delayed pass. In 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1904, Penn was generally regarded as the national champion of collegiate football.[431] Among the key players on the teams from 1897 to 1900 was Truxton Hare, Sr. who was selected as a charter member of the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951. While primarily a guard, he also ran, punted, kicked off, and drop-kicked extra points.\n\n\nThe achievements of two of Penn's other outstanding players from that era, John Heisman, a Law School alumnus, and John Outland, a Penn Med alumnus, are remembered each year with the presentation of the Heisman Trophy to the most outstanding college football player of the year, and the Outland Trophy to the most outstanding college football interior lineman of the year.\n\n\nAlso, each year the Bednarik Award is given to college football's best defensive player. Chuck Bednarik (class of 1949) was a three-time All-American center/linebacker who starred on the 1947 team and is generally regarded as Penn's all-time finest. In addition to Bednarik, the 1947 squad boasted four-time All-American tackle George Savitsky and three-time All-American halfback Skip Minisi. All three standouts were subsequently elected to the College Football Hall of Fame, as was their coach, George Munger (a star running back at Penn in the early 1930s). Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the Philadelphia Eagles, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1969.\n\n\nPenn's game against University of California at Berkeley on September 29, 1951 (in front of a crowd of 60,000 at Franklin Field), was first college football game to be broadcast in color.[463][464]\nESPN's *College GameDay* traveled to Penn to highlight the Harvard–Penn game on November 17, 2002, the first time the show had visited an Ivy League campus.\n\n\n\n### Ice hockey[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers men's ice hockey\n\n![](image)University of Pennsylvania team in front of photo of College Hall in 1896–97, its first season of existence, featuring George Orton, the future winner of gold medal in the 1900 Summer Olympics 2500 meter steeplechase (top row, second from the end of the right side\nPenn's first ice hockey team competed during the 1896–97 academic year, and joined the nascent Intercollegiate Hockey Association (IHA) in 1898–99. On the first team in 1896–97 were several players of Canadian background, among them middle-distance runner and Olympian George Orton (the first disabled person to compete in the Olympics). Penn fielded teams intermittently until 1965 when it formed a varsity squad that was terminated in 1977. Penn now fields a club team that plays in the American Collegiate Hockey Association Division II,[465] is a member of the Colonial States College Hockey Conference, and continues to play at the Class of 1923 Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[466]\n\n\n\n### Basketball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers men's basketball\n\nPenn basketball is steeped in tradition. Penn made its only (and the Ivy League's second) Final Four appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to Magic Johnson-led Michigan State in Salt Lake City. (Dartmouth twice finished second in the tournament in the 1940s, but that was before the beginning of formal League play.) Penn's team is also a member of the Philadelphia Big 5, along with La Salle, Saint Joseph's, Temple, Villanova, and Drexel. In 2007, the men's team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Texas A&M. Penn last made the NCAA tournament in 2018 where it lost to top seeded Kansas.[467]\n\n\n\n![](image)University of Pennsylvania senior Ibby Jaaber sits on top of the rim after Penn defeated Yale 86-68 on March 2, 2007 to clinch the 2006-07 Ivy League championship (Penn's 25th).\n### Olympic athletes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The University of Pennsylvania men's track team was the 1907 IC4A point winner.

Whitham (seated)\nAt least 43 different Penn alumni have earned 81 Olympic medals (26 gold).[25][note 14] Penn won more of its \"medals\"[25] (which were actually cups, trophies, or plaques, as medals were not introduced until a later Olympics) at 1900 Summer Olympics held in Paris than at any other Olympics.[469] Penn's track and field alumni who won 21 'medals' at the 1900 Paris Olympics are: (1) Alvin Kraenzlein (University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine class of 1900),[470] known as \"the father of the modern hurdling technique\",[471] who was first sportsman in the history of Olympic games to win four individual gold medals in a single discipline;[472][473] (2) Josiah McCracken, MD (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine class of 1901) who won the silver medal in the shot put and a bronze medal for the hammer throw;[474][475][476] (3) John Walter Tewksbury (Penn Dental School class of 1899) who won five 'medals' (gold in the 200 meter dash and 400 meter hurdles, silver in the 60 meter dash and 100 meter dash, and a bronze in the 200 meter hurdles);[477] (4) Irving Baxter (Penn Law class of 1901) who won five medals, including gold in both the men's high jump and men's pole vault and silver in all three of the standing jumps (long, triple, and high);[478][479] (5) Meredith Colket (College Class of 1901 (BS), Penn Law class of 1904) who won the silver 'medal' in the pole vault,[480] (6) Truxton Hare (Penn Law class of 1904) who won the silver 'medal' in the hammer throw[481] (and at 1904 Summer Olympics held in St. Louis, Missouri, won (i) bronze medal in the all-around discipline (which consisted of 100 yard run, shot put, high jump, 880 yard walk, hammer throw, pole vault, 120 yard hurdles, long jump and one mile run), and (ii) gold medal as part of United States tug of war team),[481] and (7) George Orton (University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Arts and Sciences class of 1894 (MA) and class of 1896 (PhD)) who (as first physically disabled Olympic athlete) won a gold 'medal' in the 2,500 meter run and a bronze metal in the 400 meter hurdles[482]\n\n\nThe first African American in the United States to win an Olympic gold medal at an Olympics, the 1908 London Olympics, as part of Medley relay where he ran the third leg, the 400 meters, was John Taylor (University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine (class of 1908)). Taylor was followed by William Hamilton and Nate Cartmell (fellow Penn athlete).[468]\n\n\nIn the 2020 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan, in summer of 2021, nine Penn students and alumni played in six different sports from six different countries.[483]\n\n\n\n### Curling[edit]\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Curling Club qualified for the 2023 National Championship at 6th place, the same ranking they qualified for the 2022 National Championship (where they finished in 2nd place), but in 2023 the team won the national championship by defeating arch rival Princeton University in the championship match (6 to 3).[484][485] Penn Curling also won the National Championship in 2016 and is the only East Coast team to have won the Curling National Championship.[486]\n\n\n\n### Facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn's Franklin Field, in photograph taken shortly after completion of the upper deck in 1925.\nFranklin Field, with a present seating capacity of 52,593,[487] is where the Quakers play football, lacrosse, sprint football and track and field (and formerly played baseball, field hockey, soccer, and rugby). It is the (a) oldest stadium still operating for college football games,[488] (b) first stadium to sport two tiers,[489] (c) first stadium in the country to have a scoreboard, (d) second stadium to have a radio broadcast of football (in 1922 as Pitt versus West Virginia was broadcast in 1921), (e) first stadium from which a commercially televised football game was broadcast (in 1940),[487] and (f) first stadium from which college football game was broadcast in color (on September 29, 1951).[490] Franklin Field also played host to the Philadelphia Eagles from 1958 to 1970 (where installation of artificial turf in 1969 caused it to be first NFL stadium to have such artificial turf),[487] and was the site of 18 Army–Navy games between 1899 and 1935.[491]\n\n\nIt is currently also used by Penn students for recreation such as intramural and club sports, including touch football and cricket. Since 1895, Franklin Field has hosted the annual collegiate track and field event \"the Penn Relays\", which is the oldest and largest track and field competition in the United States.[492]\n\n\nPenn's home court, the Palestra, is an arena used for men's and women's basketball teams, volleyball teams, wrestling team, and Philadelphia Big Five basketball, and other high school sporting events. The Palestra has hosted more NCAA Tournament basketball games than any other facility. Penn staff and students make use of the Palestra to play and/or watch basketball, volleyball, and fencing.\n\n\nPenn's River Fields hosts a number of athletic fields including the Rhodes Soccer Stadium (for both women's and men's soccer, which includes elevated stands for 650 spectators, a 180-degree rotating scoreboard, and the Rapaport Family Suite), the Ellen Vagelos C'90 Field Hockey Field (with special artificial turf), and Irving \"Moon\" Mondschein Throwing Complex (for javelin, shot put, discus, and Hammer throw).[493] In addition, Penn baseball plays its home games at Meiklejohn Stadium at Murphy Field.\n\n\nPenn's Class of 1923 Arena (with seating for up to 3,000 people) was built to host the University of Pennsylvania Varsity Ice Hockey Team, which has been disbanded, and now hosts or in the past hosted: (a) Penn's Men's and Penn Women's club ice hockey teams, (b) practices and/or exhibition games for the Philadelphia Flyers, Colorado Avalanche and Carolina Hurricanes, (c) roller hockey for the Philadelphia Bulldogs professional team, and (d) rock concerts such as one in 1982 featuring Prince.[494][495][496]\n\n\nThe Olympic Boycott Games of 1980 was held at the University of Pennsylvania in response to Moscow's hosting of the 1980 Summer Olympics following the Soviet incursion in Afghanistan.

These historic figures include George Clymer, Francis Hopkinson, Thomas McKean, Robert Morris, William Paca, George Ross, Benjamin Rush, James Wilson, Thomas Fitzsimons, Jared Ingersoll, Rufus King, Thomas Mifflin, Gouverneur Morris and Hugh Williamson.[527][528] Penn alumni include 32 U.S. senators, 163 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 19 U.S. Cabinet Secretaries, 46 governors, and 28 State Supreme Court justices.[529]\n\n\nPenn alumni have also had a significant impact on the United States military as they include Samuel Nicholas, United States Marine Corps founder, and William A. Newell, whose congressional action formed a predecessor to the current United States Coast Guard,[530]: p.1 col.5 – p.2 col.1 and numerous alumni have become generals or similar rank in the United States Armed Forces. At least 2 Penn alumni have been NASA astronauts[531][532] and 5 Penn alumni have been awarded the Medal of Honor.[28][29]\n\n\nAs of 2023, there have been 38 Nobel laureates affiliated (see List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation) with the University of Pennsylvania,[533][505][16] of whom four are current faculty members and eight are alumni.[*citation needed*] Penn also educated members of the United States National Academies and the Academy of Arts and Sciences,[*citation needed*] eight National Medal of Science laureates, numerous Sloan Fellows, several members of the American Philosophical Society, many Guggenheim Fellowships, several Pulitzer Prize winners, four Turing Award winners, and a Fields Medalist[534] [535] [536][537][538]\n\n\n\n### Alumni relations and inter-Ivy events[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to active alumni chapters globally, in 1989, the university bought a 14-story clubhouse building (purpose-built for Yale Club) in New York City from Touro College for $15 million[539] to house Penn's largest alumni chapter. After raising a separate $25 million (including $150,000+ donations each from such alumni as Estee Lauder heirs Leonard Lauder and Ronald Lauder, Saul Steinberg, Michael Milken, Donald Trump, and Ronald Perelman) and two years of renovation,[540] the Penn Club of New York moved to its current location at 30 West 44th Street on NYC's Clubhouse Row[541] across the street from the Harvard Club of New York City, a block west of the Cornell Club of New York, and two blocks west of the Yale Club of New York City. It also is one block north of the (closed due to bank default[542] in 2021) former Princeton Club of New York and joins with those clubs in inter-Ivy events. Although its university is located in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan, the Columbia University Club of New York does not have its own clubhouse and shares the 30 West 44th Street clubhouse with the Penn Club. The New York region of Columbia maintains an office in the Penn Club.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Philadelphia portal\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n\n\n* List of universities by number of billionaire alumni\n* Education in Philadelphia\n* Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program (TTCSP)\n* University of Pennsylvania Press\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** It was not until 1785 that the name was made official as between 1779 and 1785 name was simply \"University\" in Philadelphia see \"Statutes of the Trustees\". University of Pennsylvania. Retrieved September 12, 2022.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The university officially uses 1740 as its founding date and has since 1899. The ideas and intellectual inspiration for the academic institution stem from 1749, with a pamphlet published by Benjamin Franklin (1705/1706–1790). When Franklin's institution was established, it inhabited a schoolhouse built on November 14, 1740, for another school, which never came to practical fruition.[2] Penn archivist Mark Frazier Lloyd noted, \"In 1899, UPenn's Trustees adopted a resolution that established 1740 as the founding date, but good cases may be made for 1749, when Franklin first convened the Trustees, or 1751, when the first classes were taught at the affiliated secondary school for boys, Academy of Philadelphia, or 1755, when Penn obtained its collegiate charter to add a post-secondary institution, the College of Philadelphia.\"[3] Princeton's library presents another diplomatically-phrased view.[4]\n3. **^** See list of University of Pennsylvania people athletics section for list of Penn Olympic medal winners, replete with hyperlinks.\n4. **^**  Penn is the fourth-oldest using the founding dates claimed by each institution. The College of Philadelphia, which became Penn, College of New Jersey, which became Princeton University, and King's College, which later became Columbia College and ultimately Columbia University, all originated within a few years of each other. After initially designating 1750 as its founding date, Penn later considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century with Penn alumni observing a centennial celebration in 1849. In 1895, several elite universities in the United States convened in New York City as the Intercollegiate Commission at the invitation of John J. McCook, a Union Army officer during the American Civil War and member of Princeton's board of trustees who chaired its Committee on Academic Dress. The primary purpose of the conference was to standardize American academic regalia, which was accomplished through the adoption of the Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume. This formalized protocol included a provision that established academic processions and placed visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates. The following year, Penn's *The Alumni Register* magazine, published by the General Alumni Society, began a campaign to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740, to become older than Princeton, which had been chartered in 1746. Three years later in 1899, the university's board of trustees acceded to this alumni initiative and officially changed its founding date from 1749 to 1740, altering its rank in academic processions and offering the informal bragging rights associated with the age-based hierarchy in academia.[36] Princeton implicitly challenges this rationale,[37][38] Further complicating the comparison, a University of Edinburgh-educated Presbyterian minister from Scotland, William Tennent, and his son Gilbert Tennent operated a Log College in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from 1726 until 1746; some have suggested a connection between it and Princeton because five members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were affiliated with it, including Gilbert Tennent, William Tennent, Jr., and Samuel Finley, the latter of whom later became president of Princeton. All 12 members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were leaders from the New Side or New Light wing of the Presbyterian Church in the New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania areas.[39] This antecedent relationship, when considered a formal lineage with institutional continuity, would justify placing Princeton's founding date back to 1726, which would make it earlier than Penn's 1740 founding. However, Princeton has not asserted this, and a Princeton historian says that \"the facts do not warrant\" such an interpretation.[40] Columbia also implicitly challenges Penn's use of either 1750, 1749 or 1740 as its founding date since it claims to be the fifth-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States after Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, and Princeton based on its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755.[41] Academic histories of American higher education typically list Penn variously as either the nation's fifth or sixth-oldest institution of higher learning in the nation after Princeton and immediately before or after Columbia.[42][43][44]\n\nEven Penn's account of its early history agrees that the Academy of Philadelphia did not add the College of Philadelphia until 1755, but university officials continue to make it their practice to assert their fourth-oldest place in academic processions. Other American universities that began in the colonial era, such as St. John's College, which was founded as King William's School in 1696, and the University of Delaware, which was founded as the Free Academy in 1743, choose to utilize the dates they became institutions of higher learning. Penn history professor Edgar Potts Cheyney was a member of the Penn class of 1883 who played a leading role in the 1896–1899 alumni campaign to change the university's formal founding date. According to Cheyney's later recollection, the university considered its founding date to be 1749 for almost a century. However, it was changed with good reason, and primarily due to a publication about the university issued by the U.S. Commissioner of Education written by Francis Newton Thorpe, a fellow alumnus, and colleague in the Penn history department. The year 1740 is the date of the establishment of the university's first educational trust. Cheyney states that \"it might be considered a lawyer's date; it is a familiar legal practice in considering the date of any institution to seek out the oldest trust it administers\". He also points out that Harvard's founding date is also the year in which the Massachusetts General Court, the state legislature of Massachusetts at the time of its founding, resolved to establish a fund in a year's time for a school or college. Princeton claims its founding date is 1746, the date of its first charter. However, the exact words of the charter are unknown, the number and names of the trustees in the charter are unknown, and no known original of the charter is known to exist. Except for Columbia University, the majority of colonial-era colleges and universities do not have clear-cut dates of foundation.[45]\n5. **^** \"...(d) On November 27, 1779, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed an act for the establishment of a University incorporating the rights and powers of the College, Academy, and Charitable School.

It is one of nine colonial colleges and was chartered prior to the U.S. Declaration of Independence when Benjamin Franklin, the university's founder and first president, advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\nThe university has four undergraduate schools and 12 graduate and professional schools. Schools enrolling undergraduates include the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the Wharton School, and the School of Nursing. Among its highly ranked graduate schools are its law school, whose first professor James Wilson participated in writing the first draft of the U.S. Constitution, its medical school, which was the first medical school established in North America, and Wharton, the nation's first collegiate business school. Penn's endowment is US$20.7 billion, making it the sixth-wealthiest private academic institution in the nation as of 2022. In 2020, the university was awarded $1.5 billion in research grants, the fourth-largest of any U.S. university.[14]\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania's main campus is located in the University City neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and is centered around College Hall. Notable campus landmarks include Houston Hall, the first modern student union, and Franklin Field, the nation's first dual-level college football stadium and the nation's longest-standing NCAA Division I college football stadium in continuous operation.[15] The university's athletics program, the Penn Quakers, fields varsity teams in 33 sports as a member of NCAA Division I's Ivy League conference.\n\n\nSince its founding, Penn alumni, trustees, and faculty have included 8 signers of the Declaration of Independence, 7 signers of the Constitution, 3 Presidents of the United States, 3 U.S. Supreme Court justices, 32 U.S. senators, 163 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 19 U.S. Cabinet Secretaries, 46 governors, 28 State Supreme Court justices, and 9 foreign heads of state. Alumni and faculty include 39 Nobel laureates,[16][17] 4 Turing Award winners,[18] and a Fields Medalist.[19][20][21] Penn has graduated 32 Rhodes Scholars[22] and 21 Marshall Scholars.[23] As of 2022, Penn has the largest number of undergraduate alumni who are billionaires of all colleges and universities (17, counting only Penn's four undergraduate schools).[24] At least (a) 43 different Penn alumni have earned 81 Olympic medals (26 gold),[25][note 3] (b) 2 Penn alumni have been NASA astronauts, [26][27] and (c) 5 Penn alumni have been awarded the Medal of Honor.[28][29]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins of the college[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Academy and College of Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Benjamin Franklin\n\n![](image)Benjamin Franklin, founder of the University of Pennsylvania, was the primary founder, benefactor, and a president of the board of trustees for the Academy and College of Philadelphia, which merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to form the University of Pennsylvania in 1791.\nIn 1740, a group of Philadelphians organized to erect a great preaching hall for George Whitefield, a traveling evangelist who toured the American colonies delivering open-air sermons.[30] The building was designed and constructed by Edmund Woolley and was the largest building in Philadelphia at the time, drawing thousands of people the first time in which it was preached.[31]: 26 The preaching hall was initially intended to also serve as a charity school, but a lack of funds forced plans for the chapel and school to be suspended. \n\n\nAccording to Franklin's autobiography, it was in 1743 when he first had the idea to establish an academy, \"thinking the Rev. Richard Peters a fit person to superintend such an institution\". However, Peters declined a casual inquiry from Franklin, though Peters was one of Penn's founding trustees [1749 to 1776], President of board of trustees [1756 to 1764], and Treasurer of board of trustees [1769 to 1770][32]).\n\n\nNothing further was done by Franklin for another six years when he again contacted not just Peters but many others.[31]: 30 Hence, in the fall of 1749, Franklin circulated a pamphlet titled \"Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania\", his vision for what he called a \"Public Academy of Philadelphia\",[33] which argued for establishing an institution that would provide higher education to its citizens.\n\n\nThe 1749 proposal was seen as innovative at the time, and Franklin organized 24 trustees to help guide the institution he envisioned. The group acquired a dormant building after its owners asked Franklin's group to assume their debts and, accordingly, their inactive trusts. On February 1, 1750, a new board of trustees took over the building and trusts of the old board. On August 13, 1751, the Academy of Philadelphia, using the great hall at 4th and Arch Streets, was established and began taking in its first secondary students. A charity school also was chartered on July 13, 1753,[34]: 12 by the intentions of the original donors, although it lasted only a few years. On June 16, 1755, the College of Philadelphia was chartered, paving the way for the addition of undergraduate instruction.[34]: 13 All three schools shared the same board of trustees and were considered part of the same institution.[35] The first commencement exercises were held on May 17, 1757.[34]: 14\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania considers itself the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this is contested by Princeton and Columbia Universities.[note 4]\n\n\nUnlike the other colonial colleges that existed in 1749, including Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, and the College of New Jersey, Franklin's new school did not focus exclusively on educating clergy. He advocated what was then an innovative concept of higher education, which taught both the ornamental knowledge of the arts and the practical skills necessary for making a living and performing public service. The proposed program of study could have become the nation's first modern liberal arts curriculum, although it was never implemented because Anglican priest William Smith, who became the first provost, and other trustees strongly preferred the traditional curriculum.[46][47]\n\n\nFranklin assembled a board of trustees from among Philadelphia's leading citizens, the first such non-sectarian board in the nation. At the first meeting of the board of trustees on November 13, 1749, the issue of where to locate the school was a prime concern. Although a lot across Sixth Street from the old Pennsylvania State House, later renamed and famously known since 1776 as Independence Hall, was offered without cost by James Logan, its owner, the trustees realized that the building erected in 1740 by Edmund Woolley for George Whitefield,[48] which was still vacant, was an even more preferable site.\n\n\nThe institution of higher learning was named and known as the College of Philadelphia from 1755 to 1779. In 1779, not trusting then provost William Smith's Loyalist tendencies, the revolutionary State Legislature created a university, and in 1785 the legislature changed name to University of the State of Pennsylvania.[35][note 5] The result was a schism, with Smith continuing to operate an attenuated version of the College of Philadelphia. In 1791, the legislature issued a new charter, merging the two institutions into a new University of Pennsylvania with twelve men from each institution serving on the new board of trustees.[35]\n\n\nAlthough Penn began operating as an academy or secondary school in 1751 and obtained its collegiate charter in 1755, it initially designated 1750 as its founding date. Sometime later in its early history, Penn began naming 1749 as its founding date, which it continued to reference as the founding date for over a century, including at a centennial celebration in 1849.[49] In 1899, the board of trustees voted to adjust the founding date earlier again, this time to 1740, the date of \"the creation of the earliest of the many educational trusts the University has taken upon itself\", according to a book on the university's history.[50] The board of trustees voted in response to a three-year campaign by Penn's General Alumni Society to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740 for a number of reasons, including to appear older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746.[51]\n\n\n\n### First university[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1765 admission ticket to \"A Course of Lectures\" given by Dr. John Morgan, the founder and first professor of medicine at Penn's Medical School\nThe University of Pennsylvania considers itself the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies, though that claim is contested by other universities. Penn has two claims to being the first university in the United States, according to the former university archives director Mark Frazier Lloyd: \n\n\n\n(1) the 1765 founding of the first medical school in America[52] made Penn the first institution to offer both \"undergraduate\" and professional education (\"the 'de facto' position\")\n(2) the 1779 charter made it the first American institution of higher learning to take the name of \"University\" (\"the 'de jure' position\").[53][54][55]\n### Original campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A circa 1780 sketch of the Academy and College of Philadelphia when its first dormitory (on right) was built\nThe Academy of Philadelphia, a secondary school for boys, began operations in 1751 in an unused church assembly hall building at 4th and Arch Streets, which had sat unfinished and dormant for over a decade. Upon receiving a collegiate charter in 1755, the first classes for the College of Philadelphia were taught in the same building, in many cases to the same boys who had already graduated from The Academy of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n### Campus as Capital of United States[edit]\n\n\nWhen the British abandoned Philadelphia during the Philadelphia campaign in the American Revolutionary War, College Hall, the college's only building at the time,[note 6] served as the temporary meeting site of the Second Continental Congress from July 7 to 20, 1778.[56] The British Army, led by General Sir William Howe, damaged many important parts of Philadelphia. Howe's attack caused significant damage to the Pennsylvania State House, now known as Independence Hall, the site where the Second Continental Congress convened and which it was forced to abandon in anticipation of the British attack and occupation of the city.[57]\n\n\nBy July 7, 1778, the Second Continental Congress returned to Philadelphia with the requisite quorum, but convened at College Hall since Independence Hall was damaged by the British attack, briefly establishing Penn's campus as one of the early capitals of the United States.[58][59] Penn's brief status as the nation's capital is evidenced by a July 13, 1778, letter sent from Josiah Bartlett, a signatory to the Articles of Confederation and the Declaration of Independence, to John Langdon, who was also a Founding Father from New Hampshire. Langdon, who later became a signatory of the United States Constitution, wrote: \"The Congress meets in the College Hall[note 7] as the State House was left by the enemy in a most filthy and sordid situation, as were many of the public and private buildings in the City.\"[60]\n\n\n\n### 9th Street campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A c. 1815 illustration of the Ninth Street campus of the University of Pennsylvania, including the medical department (on left) and the college building (on right), which was originally intended to serve as the residence for the President of the United States before the national capital was moved from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. in 1800\n![](image)A ticket to an 1807 lecture by Benjamin Rush, then a professor at Penn's Department of Medicine[61]\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus, located on the west side of Ninth Street between Market and Chestnut Streets, and a hand-colored lithograph created in 1842 by John Caspar Wild of Medical Hall (on left) and College Hall (on right), both built between 1829 and 1830\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus above Chestnut Street and Medical Hall just prior to the university's 1871 move to its current location in West Philadelphia\nIn 1802, the university moved to the unused Presidential Mansion at Ninth and Market Streets, a building that both George Washington and John Adams had declined to occupy while Philadelphia was the nation's capital.[34]\n\n\nAmong the classes given in 1807 at this building were those offered by Benjamin Rush, a professor of chemistry, medical theory, and clinical practice who was also a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, member of the Continental Congress,[62][63] and surgeon general of the Continental Army.[64] \nClasses were held in the mansion until 1829 when it was demolished. Architect William Strickland designed twin buildings on the same site, College Hall[note 8] and Medical Hall (both 1829–1830), which formed the core of the Ninth Street Campus until Penn's move to West Philadelphia in the 1870s.\n\n\n\n### West Philadelphia campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An illustration of Penn's College Hall from a pocket guide to the Centennial Exhibition in 1876, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence\n![](image)An illustration of the University of Pennsylvania campus in West Philadelphia from a *Brief Guide to Philadelphia*, published in 1918\nAfter being located in downtown Philadelphia for more than a century, the campus was moved across the Schuylkill River to property purchased from the Blockley Almshouse in West Philadelphia in 1872, where it has since remained in an area now known as University City.\n\n\n\n### Residential university[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1750s, roughly 40 percent of Penn students needed lodging since they came from areas in the U.S. that were too far to commute, or were international students.[65] Before the completion of the construction of the first dormitory in 1765, out of town students were typically placed with guardians in the homes of faculty or in suitable boarding houses, such as the one run by widow Rachel Marks Graydon, mother of Penn College Class of 1775 student Alexander Graydon.[66][67]\n\n\nIn 1765, the campus was expanded by opening of the newly completed dormitory run by Benjamin Franklin's collaborator on the study of electricity using electrostatic machines and related technology and Penn professor and chief master Ebenezer Kinnersley.[note 9] Kinnersley was designated steward of the students in the dormitory and he and his wife were given disciplinary powers over the students and supervised the cleanliness of the students with respect to personal hygiene and washing of the students' dirty clothing.[68][69]\n\n\nEven after its construction, however, many students sought living quarters elsewhere, where they would have more personal freedom, resulting in a loss of funds to the university. In the fall of 1775, Penn's trustees voted to advertise to lease the dormitory to a private family who would board the pupils at lesser cost to Penn.[70] In another attempt to control the off-campus activities of the students, the trustees agreed not to admit any out-of-town student unless he was lodged in a place which they and the faculty considered proper.[65] As of 1779, Penn, through its trustees, owned three houses on Fourth Street, just north of the campus's new building with the largest residence located on the corner of Fourth and Arch Streets.[71][65]\n\n\nStarting in 1849 with formation of Penn's Eta chapter[note 10] of Delta Phi by five founders and 15 initiates,[72] Penn students began to establish residential fraternity houses. Since Penn only had limited housing near campus and since students, especially those at the medical school, came from all over the country, the students elected to fend for themselves rather than live in housing owned by Penn trustees. A number chose housing by pledging and living in Penn's first fraternities, which included Delta Phi, Zeta Psi, Phi Kappa Sigma, and Delta Psi.[73] These first fraternities were located within walking distance of 9th and Chestnut Street since the campus was located from 1800 to 1872 on the west side of Ninth Street, from Market Street on the north to Chestnut Street on the south. Zeta Psi Fraternity was located at the southeast corner of 10th Street and Chestnut Street, Delta Phi was located on the south side of 11th Street near Chestnut Street, and Delta Psi was located on the north side of Chestnut Street, west of 10th Street.[74]\n\n\nWhen Penn moved to West Philadelphia in 1872, the new campus and its associated fraternities centered on the intersection of Woodland Avenue, 36th Street, and Locust Street. Among the first fraternities to build near the new campus were Phi Delta Theta in 1883 and Psi Upsilon in 1891. By 1891, there were at least 17 fraternities at the university.[75]\n\n\nFrom its founding until construction of the Quadrangle Dormitories, which started construction in 1895, the university largely lacked university-owned housing with the exception of a significant part of the 18th century. A significant portion of the undergraduate population commuted from Delaware Valley locations, and a large number of students resided in the Philadelphia area.[76] The medical school, then with roughly half the students, was a significant exception to this trend as it attracted a more geographically diverse population of students. For example, in the 1850s when Penn's medical school accounted for two-thirds to three-quarters of the student body, over half of the population of the medical school was from the southern part of the United States.[77][78]\n\n\nThe university experienced increased need for housing in the last decade of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century as it began to compete with peer institutions to recruit foreign students.\n\n\nGeorge Henderson, president of the class of 1889, wrote in his monograph distributed to his classmates at their 20th reunion that Penn's strong growth in acreage and number of buildings it constructed over the prior two decades (along with a near-quadrupling in the size of the student body) was accommodated by building The Quad.[79]\n\n\nHenderson argued that building The Quad was influential in attracting students, and he appealed for it to be expanded:[80]\n\n\n\n\n> And the new buildings? First of all there is need of greater dormitory room. Did you ever live in the \"dorms?\" Then you do not know what \"dorm\" life means for college spirit. Several hundred men who live in the same big family have a feeling of common fellowship. Life in the \"dorms\" develops what our sociologists call a \"Solidarity of Responsibility.\" Men who live there learn to care for the associations that brought them together and that keep them related. And this college spirit they never lose or forget.\n> Some parents, living at a distance, do not like to send their sons to live in a general boarding house. But a dormitory, a University institution, appeals to them, and the boys come and live there. You would scarcely believe it, but when College opened last fall not only were the dormitory rooms over subscribed, but there was a long list of anxious ones, ready to snap up the room of any unlucky fellow who might miss his examinations, and be forced to spend another year at preparatory school grind. So we need the new dormitories, and although they are going up steadily, they might well go up faster.[80]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1911, since it was difficult to house the international students due to the segregation-era housing regulations in Philadelphia and across the United States, the Christian Association at the University of Pennsylvania hired its first Foreign Mission Secretary, Reverend Alpheus Waldo Stevenson.[81] By 1912, Stevenson focused almost all his efforts on the foreign students at Penn who needed help finding housing resulting in the Christian Association buying 3905 Spruce Street located adjacent to Penn's West Philadelphia campus.[82] By January 1, 1918, 3905 Spruce Street officially opened under the sponsorship of the Christian Association as a Home for Foreign Students, which came to be known as the International Students' House with Reverend Stevenson as its first director. The International Students' House provided \" ... counseling and information services for a host of problems foreign students might encounter, including language, financial, health and diet, immigration and technical problems as well as maladjustment to living in the United States. It was also used for recreation and leisure, as lounges had radio, phonograph and television facilities and there were game and reception rooms. The International Students' House also provided for programs including forums, debates, lectures, panels and planned trips and outings as well as weekend activities such as dances, films and game nights. Also, for the next thirty-three years, the International Students' House would be sponsored by the Christian Association of the University of Pennsylvania.\"[83]\n\n\nThe success of efforts to reach out to the international students was reported in 1921 when the university reported that the university's 12,000 students at the time came from all 50 states and 253 came from at least 50 foreign countries and foreign territories, including India, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and \"...every Latin American country, and most of the Oriental and European nations\".[84]\n\n\nBy 1931, first-year students were required to live in the quadrangle unless they received official permission to live with their families or other relatives.[77] However, throughout this period and into the early post-World War II period, the undergraduate schools of the university continued to have a large commuting population.[85] As an example, into the late 1940s, two-thirds of Penn women students were commuters.[86]\n\n\nAfter World War II, the university began a capital spending program to overhaul its campus, including its student housing. A large number of students migrating to universities under the G.I. Bill, and the ensuing increase in Penn's student population highlighted that Penn had outgrown previous expansions, which ended during the Great Depression era. But in addition to a significant student population from the Delaware Valley, the university continued to attract international students from at least 50 countries and from all 50 states as early as of the second decade of the 1920s.[84][87] Penn Trustee Paul Miller wrote that, in the post-World War II era,: \"[t]he bricks-and-mortar Capital Campaign of the Sixties...built the facilities that turned Penn from a commuter school to a residential one....\"[88] By 1961, 79% of male undergraduates and 57% of female undergraduates lived on campus.[89]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1930 to 1966, there were 54 documented Rowbottom riots, a student tradition of rioting which included everything from car smashing to panty raids.[90] After 1966, there were five more instances of \"Rowbottoms\", the latest occurring in 1980.[90]\n\n\nIn 1965, Penn students learned that the university was sponsoring research projects for the United States' chemical and biological weapons program.[91] According to Herman and Rutman, the revelation that \"CB Projects Spicerack and Summit were directly connected with U.S. military activities in Southeast Asia\", caused students to petition Penn president Gaylord Harnwell to halt the program, citing the project as being \"immoral, inhuman, illegal, and unbefitting of an academic institution\".[91] Members of the faculty believed that an academic university should not be performing classified research and voted to re-examine the university agency which was responsible for the project on November 4, 1965.[91]\n\n\nIn 1983, members of the Animal Liberation Front broke into the Head Injury Clinical Research Laboratory in the School of Medicine and stole research audio and video tapes. The stolen tapes were given to PETA who edited the footage to create a film, *Unnecessary Fuss*. As a result of media coverage and pressure from animal rights activists, the project was closed down.[92]\n\n\nThe school gained notoriety in 1993 for the water buffalo incident in which a student who told a group of mostly black female students to \"shut up, you water buffalo\" was charged with violating the university's racial harassment policy.[93]\n\n\nIn 2022, some asked for the tenure of a University of Pennsylvania law school professor to be revoked after she said the country is \"better off with fewer Asians.\"[94][95]\n\n\n\n### Educational innovations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Houston Hall, the first college student union in the nation\n![](image)Franklin Institute's chief meteorologist Jon Nese (left) and his production crew from WHYY-TV (right) in front of a portion of the original ENIAC computer in the university's ENIAC museum on campus\nPenn's educational innovations include the nation's first medical school in 1765; the first university teaching hospital in 1874; the Wharton School, the world's first collegiate business school, in 1881; the first American student union building, Houston Hall, in 1896;[96] the only school of veterinary medicine in the United States that originated directly from its medical school, in 1884;[97][98] and the home of ENIAC, the world's first electronic, large-scale, general-purpose digital computer in 1946. Penn is also home to the oldest continuously functioning psychology department in North America and is where the American Medical Association was founded.[99][100] In 1921, Penn was also the first university to award a PhD in economics to an African American woman, Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander.[101]\n\n\n\n### Motto[edit]\n\n\nIn 1932, all elements of the seal were revised. As part of the redesign, it was decided that the new motto \"mutilated\" Horace, and it was changed to its present wording, *Leges Sine Moribus Vanae*, 'Laws without morals [are] useless'.[102]\nPenn's motto is based on a line from Horace's III.24 (Book 3, Ode 24), *quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt?*, 'of what avail empty laws without [good] morals?'. From 1756 to 1898, the motto read **Sine Moribus Vanae**. When it was pointed out that the motto could be translated as 'Loose women without morals', the university quickly changed the motto to *literae sine moribus vanae*, 'Letters without morals [are] useless'.\n\n\n\n### Seal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 1757 seal of the Academy and College of Philadelphia; in 1779, the college was renamed the \"University in Philadelphia\" and, following the end of the Revolutionary War in 1782, assumed its current name, the University of Pennsylvania\nThe official seal of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania serves as the signature and symbol of authenticity on documents issued by the corporation.[103] A request for one was first recorded in a meeting of the trustees in 1753 during which some of the Trustees \"desired to get a Common Seal engraved for the Use of [the] Corporation\". In 1756, a public seal and motto for the college was engraved in silver.[104] The most recent design, a modified version of the original seal, was approved in 1932, adopted a year later and is still used for much of the same purposes as the original.[103]\n\n\nThe outer ring of the current seal is inscribed with \"Universitas Pennsylvaniensis\", the Latin name of the University of Pennsylvania. The inside contains seven stacked books on a desk with the titles of subjects of the trivium and a modified quadrivium, components of a classical education: Theolog[ia], Astronom[ia], Philosoph[ia], Mathemat[ica], Logica, Rhetorica and Grammatica. Between the books and the outer ring is the Latin motto of the university, \"Leges Sine Moribus Vanae\".[103]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)This statue of Benjamin Franklin, donated to the City of Philadelphia in 1899, now sits in front of College Hall at the center of Penn's main campus in honor of Franklin, the university's founder.[105]\n![](image)A 1915 map of the University of Pennsylvania campus in West Philadelphia, published by Rand McNally[106]\n![](image)Upper Quad Gate forming lower part of Memorial Tower, which honors veterans of the Spanish–American War\n![](image)Center City Philadelphia seen from the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District with Huntsman Hall in the foreground\n![](image)Wistar Institute's seven-story steel and glass 2014 building located next to a brick building, constructed in 1897, both on Penn's main historic campus on North side of Spruce Street between 36th and 37th streets\nMuch of Penn's architecture was designed by the Philadelphia-based architecture firm Cope and Stewardson, whose owners were Philadelphia born and raised architects and professors at Penn who also designed Princeton University and a large part of Washington University in St. Louis.[107][108] They were known for having combined the Gothic architecture of the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge with the local landscape to establish the Collegiate Gothic style.[109]\n\n\nThe present core campus covers over 299 acres (121 ha) in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia's University City section, whereas the older heart of the campus comprises the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District. All of Penn's schools and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. The surrounding neighborhood includes several restaurants, bars, a large upscale grocery store, and a movie theater on the western edge of campus. Penn's core campus borders Drexel University and is a few blocks from the University City campus of Saint Joseph's University (which absorbed University of the Sciences in Philadelphia via a merger) and The Restaurant School at Walnut Hill College.\n\n\nThe renowned cancer research center Wistar Institute is also located on campus. In 2014, a new 7-story glass and steel building was completed next to the institute's original brick edifice built in 1897 further expanding collaboration between the university and the Wistar Institute.[110]\n\n\nThe Module 6 Utility Plant and Garage at Penn was designed by BLT Architects and completed in 1995. Module 6 is located at 38th and Walnut and includes spaces for 627 vehicles, 9,000 sq ft (840 m2) of storefront retail operations, a 9,500-ton chiller module and corresponding extension of the campus chilled water loop, and a 4,000-ton ice storage facility.[111]\n\n\nIn 2010, in its first significant expansion across the Schuylkill River, Penn purchased 23 acres (9.3 ha) at the northwest corner of 34th Street and Grays Ferry Avenue, the then site of DuPont Marshall Research Labs. In October 2016, Penn completed the design (with help from architects Matthias Hollwich, Marc Kushner, and KSS Architects) and renovation of the center piece of the project, a former paint factory it named *Pennovation Works*. *Pennovation Works* houses shared desks, wet labs, common areas, a \"pitch bleacher,\" and other attributes of a tech incubator. The rest of the site, which Penn is formally calling \"South Bank\" (of Schuylkill River), is a mixture of lightly refurbished industrial buildings that serve as affordable and flexible workspaces and land for future development. Penn hopes that \"South Bank will provide a place for academics, researchers, and entrepreneurs to establish their businesses in close proximity to each other to facilitate cross-pollination of their ideas, creativity, and innovation.[112]\n\n\n\n### Parks and arboreta[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Penn acquired about 35 acres (14 ha) between the campus and the Schuylkill River at the former site of the Philadelphia Civic Center and a nearby 24-acre (9.7 ha) site then owned by the United States Postal Service. Dubbed the Postal Lands, the site extends from Market Street on the north to Penn's Bower Field on the south, including the former main regional U.S. Postal Building at 30th and Market Streets, now the regional office for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Over the next decade, the site became the home to educational, research, biomedical, and mixed-use facilities. The first phase, comprising a park and athletic facilities, opened in the fall of 2011.\n\n\nIn September 2011, Penn completed the construction of the $46.5 million, 24-acre (9.7 ha) Penn Park, which features passive and active recreation and athletic components framed and subdivided by canopy trees, lawns, and meadows. It is located east of the Highline Green and stretches from Walnut Street to South Streets.\n\n\nPenn maintains two arboreta. The first is the roughly 300-acre (120 ha) *The Penn Campus Arboretum at the University of Pennsylvania* encompasses the entire University City main campus. The campus arboretum is an urban forest with over 6,500 trees representing 240 species of trees and shrubs, ten specialty gardens and five urban parks,[113] which has been designated as a Tree Campus USA[114] since 2009 and formally recognized as an accredited ArbNet Arboretum since 2017.[113] Penn maintains an interactive website linked to Penn's comprehensive tree inventory, which allows users to explore Penn's entire collection of trees.[115] The second arboretum, Penn's Morris Arboretum & Gardens (the official arboretum of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania) is 92 acres (sited over 15 miles from Penn's \"Campus Arboretum\") and contains more than 13,000 labelled plants from over 2,500 types, representing the temperate floras of North America, Asia, and Europe, with a primary focus on Asia \n[116]\n\n\n\n### Bolton Center[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Bolton Center\n\nPenn also owns the 687-acre (278 ha) New Bolton Center, the research and large-animal health care center of its veterinary school.[117] Located near Kennett Square, New Bolton Center received nationwide media attention when Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro underwent surgery at its Widener Hospital for injuries suffered while running in the Preakness Stakes.[118]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nPenn's library began in 1750 with a donation of books from cartographer Lewis Evans. Twelve years later, then-provost William Smith sailed to England to raise additional funds to increase the collection size. Benjamin Franklin was one of the libraries' earliest donors and, as a trustee, saw to it that funds were allocated for the purchase of texts from London, many of which are still part of the collection, more than 250 years later.\n\n\nPenn library system has grown into a system of 14 libraries with 400 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees and a total operating budget of more than $48 million.[119] The library system has 6.19 million book and serial volumes as well as 4.23 million microform items and 1.11 million e-books.[8] It subscribes to over 68,000 print serials and e-journals.[120][121]\n\n\nPenn has the following libraries, associated by school or subject area: (1) communications library, located on campus on Walnut Street between 36th and 37th Streets in the Annenberg Communications School; (2) Biddle Law Library, located on campus on 3500 block of Sansom in the Law School; (3) The Holman Biotech Commons library, located on campus, on 3500 block of Hamilton Walk, adjacent to the Robert Wood Johnson Pavilion of the Medical School and the Nursing School; (4) chemistry library, located on campus, on 3300 block of Spruce, in the 1973 Wing of the Chemistry Building; (5) dental medicine library located on campus, on 4000 block of Locust Street, in Dental School; (6) fine arts library, located on campus, on 3400 block of Woodland Ave, within the Fisher Fine Arts Library; (7) Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies library, located off campus, at 420 Walnut Street, near Independence Hall and Washington Square; (8) humanities and social sciences library (including Weigle Information Commons) located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street in the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (9) Lea library collection of Roman Catholic Church history, located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street, on the 6th floor of Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (10) Lippincott business library, located on campus, between 35th and 36th streets on Locust Street, in the second floor of the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (11) Math/Physics/Astronomy library, located on campus, on 3200 block of Walnut Streets, adjacent to The Palestra on the third floor of David Rittenhouse Laboratory; (12) archaeology and anthropology library within Penn Museum; (13) Rare Books and Manuscripts library (including the Yarnall Library of Theology) located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street, in Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (14) veterinary medicine library, located on Penn Campus, between 38th and 39th streets on Sansom Street, within the Vet School (with satellite library located off campus at New Bolton Center. Penn also maintains books and records off campus at high density storage facility.\n\n\nThe Penn Design School's Fine Arts Library was built to be Penn's main library and the first with its own building. The main library at the time was designed by Frank Furness to be first library in nation to separate the low ceilings of the library stack, where the books were stored, from forty-foot-plus high ceilinged rooms, where the books were read and studied.[122][123][124]\n\n\nThe Yarnall Library of Theology, a major American rare book collection, is part of Penn's libraries. The Yarnall Library of Theology was formerly affiliated with St. Clement's Church in Philadelphia. It was founded in 1911 under the terms of the wills of Ellis Hornor Yarnall (1839–1907) and Emily Yarnall, and subsequently housed at the former Philadelphia Divinity School. The library's major areas of focus are theology, patristics, and the liturgy, history and theology of the Anglican Communion and the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. It includes a large number of rare books, incunabula, and illuminated manuscripts, and new material continues to be added.[125][126]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nVan Pelt Library, Penn's main library building\n* ![](image)\n\nInterior of the reading room at what is now School of Design library.

This 5,900-pound (2,700 kg) bronze sculpture, which is 16 feet (4.9 m) high and 9 feet (2.7 m) in diameter at its base, depicts an African woman's head crowned with an afro framed by cornrow braids atop a form that resembles both a skirt and a clay house.[130] At the installation, Penn president Amy Guttman proclaimed that \"Ms. Leigh's sculpture brings a striking presence of strength, grace, and beauty—along with an ineffable sense of mystery and resilience—to a central crossroad of Penn's campus.\"[131]\n\n\nThe *Covenant*, known to the student body as \"Dueling Tampons\"[132][133] or \"The Tampons\",[134] is a large red structure created by Alexander Liberman and located on Locust Walk as a gateway to the high-rise residences \"super block\". It was installed in 1975 and is made of rolled sheets of milled steel.\n\n\nA white button, known as The Button and officially called the Split Button is a modern art sculpture designed by designed by Swedish sculptor Claes Oldenburg (who specialized in creating oversize sculptures of everyday objects). It sits at the south entrance of Van Pelt Library and has button holes large enough for people to stand inside. Penn also has a replica of the *Love* sculpture, part of a series created by Robert Indiana. It is a painted aluminum sculpture and was installed in 1998 overlooking College Green.[129]\n\n\nIn 2019, the Association for Public Art loaned Penn[135] two multi-ton sculptures.[136] The two works are *Social Consciousness*[137][135] (created by Sir Jacob Epstein in 1954 and sited on the walkway between Wharton's Lippincott Library and Phi Phi chapter of Alpha Chi Rho fraternity house) and *Atmosphere and Environment XII* (created by Louise Nevelson in 1970, which is sited on Shoemaker Green between Franklin Field and Ringe Squash Courts).[138]\n\n\nIn addition to the contemporary art, Penn also has a number of more traditional statues including a good number created by Penn's first Director of Physical Education Department, R. Tait McKenzie.[139] Among the notable sculptures is that of *Young Ben Franklin*, which McKenzie produced and Penn sited adjacent to the fieldhouse contiguous to Franklin Field. The sculpture is titled *Benjamin Franklin in 1723* and was created by McKenzie during the pre-World War 1 era (1910–1914). Other sculptures he produced for Penn include the 1924 sculpture of then Penn provost Edgar Fahs Smith.\n\n\nPenn is presently reevaluating all of its public art and has formed a working group led by Penn Design dean Frederick Steiner, who was part of a similar effort at the University of Texas at Austin (that led to the removal of statues of Jefferson Davis and other Confederate officials), and Penn's Chief Diversity Officer, Joann Mitchell. Penn has begun the process of adding art and removing or relocating art.[140] Penn removed from campus in 2020 the statue of the Reverend George Whitefield (who had inspired the 1740 establishment of a trust to establish a charity school, which trust Penn legally assumed in 1749) when research showed Whitefield owned fifty enslaved people and drafted and advocated for the key theological arguments in favor of slavery in Georgia and the rest of the Thirteen Colonies.[141]\n\n\n\n### Penn Museum[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\n\n![](image)University Museum and Warden Garden\n![](image)Sphinx of Ramses II at the great temple of Ptah in Memphis, circa 1200 BC\n![](image)Penn Museum's black granite statue of Goddess Sekhmet excavated in Thebes in Ramesseum in the late 18th dynasty of Egypt of 1405 to 1367 BC\nSince the Penn Museum was founded in 1887,[142] it has taken part in 400 research projects worldwide.[143] The museum's first project was an excavation of Nippur, a location in current day Iraq.[144]\n\n\nPenn Museum is home to the largest authentic sphinx in North America at about seven feet high, four feet wide, 13 feet long, and 12.9 tons (made of solid red granite).\n\n\nThe sphinx was discovered in 1912 by the British archeologist, Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, during an excavation of the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis, Egypt, where the sphinx had guarded a temple to ward off evil. Since Petri's expedition was partially financed by Penn Petrie offered it to Penn, which arranged for it to be moved to museum in 1913. The sphinx was moved in 2019 to a more prominent spot intended to attract visitors.[145]\n\n\nThe museum has three gallery floors with artifacts from Egypt, the Middle East, Mesoamerica, Asia, the Mediterranean, Africa and indigenous artifacts of the Americas.[143] Its most famous object is the goat rearing into the branches of a rosette-leafed plant, from the royal tombs of Ur.\n\n\nThe Penn Museum's excavations and collections foster a strong research base for graduate students in the Graduate Group in the Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World. Features of the Beaux-Arts building include a rotunda and gardens that include Egyptian papyrus.\n\n\n\n### Other Penn museums, galleries, and art collections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Institute of Contemporary Art, known as ICA, located just South of the Graduate Towers, the residence hall for graduate and professional students at the corner of 36th Street and Sansom Street\nPenn maintains a website providing a detailed roadmap to small museums and galleries and over one hundred locations across campus where the public can access Penn's over 8,000 artworks acquired over 250 years and includes, but is not limited to, paintings, sculptures, photography, works on paper, and decorative arts.[146] The largest of the art galleries is the Institute of Contemporary Art, one of the only kunsthalles in the country, which showcases various art exhibitions throughout the year. Since 1983 the Arthur Ross Gallery, located at the Fisher Fine Arts Library, has housed Penn's art collection[147] and is named for its benefactor, philanthropist Arthur Ross.\n\n\n\n### Residences[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Pennsylvania College Houses\n\nEvery College House at the University of Pennsylvania has at least four members of faculty in the roles of House Dean, Faculty Master, and College House Fellows.[148] Within the College Houses, Penn has nearly 40 themed residential programs for students with shared interests such as world cinema or science and technology. Many of the nearby homes and apartments in the area surrounding the campus are often rented by undergraduate students moving off campus after their first year, as well as by graduate and professional students.\n\n\nThe College Houses include W.E.B. Du Bois, Fisher Hassenfeld, Gregory, Gutmann, Harnwell, Harrison, Hill College House, Kings Court English, Lauder, Riepe, Rodin, Stouffer, and Ware. The first College House was Van Pelt College House, established in the fall of 1971. It was later renamed Gregory House.[149] Fisher Hassenfeld, Ware and Riepe together make up one building called \"The Quad\". The latest College House to be built is Guttman[150] (formerly named New College House West), which opened in the fall of 2021.[151]\n\n\nPenn students in Junior or Senior year may live in the 45 sororities and fraternities governed by three student-run governing councils, Interfraternity Council,[152] Intercultural Greek Council, and Panhellenic Council.[153]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nThe university's first purpose-built dormitory in the foreground (on right), built in 1765[154]\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Upper Quad, originally called The Triangle,[155] and formerly \"The Men's Dormitory\", viewed from the Memorial Tower[156]\n* ![](image)\n\nWoodland Walk pathway between Hill College House and Lauder College House\n* ![](image)\n\nHill College House, a dormitory designed in 1958 to house female students, was designed by Eero Saarinen\n* ![](image)\n\n\"The Quad\", formerly known as the Men's Dormitory, in 2014\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house, built by George W.

All officers are sworn municipal police officers and retain general law enforcement authority while on the campus.[157]\n\n\n\n## Academics and interdisciplinary focus[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania graduate and professional schools[158]\n| School\n | Year founded\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Perelman School of Medicine | 1765[159] |\n| School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1852[160] |\n| Law School | 1850[note 11] |\n| School of Design | 1868\n |\n| School of Dental Medicine | 1878[162] |\n| The Wharton School | 1881[163] |\n| Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1755[164] |\n| School of Veterinary Medicine | 1884[165] |\n| School of Social Policy and Practice | 1908\n |\n| Graduate School of Education | 1915\n |\n| School of Nursing | 1935\n |\n| Annenberg School for Communication | 1958\n |\n\n\nPenn's \"One University Policy\" allows students to enroll in classes in any of Penn's twelve schools.[166] The College of Arts and Sciences is the undergraduate division of the School of Arts and Sciences. The School of Arts and Sciences also contains the Graduate Division and the College of Liberal and Professional Studies, which is home to the Fels Institute of Government, the master's programs in Organizational Dynamics, and the Environmental Studies (MES) program. Wharton is the business school of the University of Pennsylvania. Other schools with undergraduate programs include the School of Nursing and the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS).\n\n\nPenn has a strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and research. It offers double degree programs, unique majors, and academic flexibility. Penn's \"One University\" policy allows undergraduates access to courses at all of Penn's undergraduate and graduate schools except the medical, veterinary and dental schools. Undergraduates at Penn may also take courses at Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and Swarthmore under a reciprocal agreement known as the Quaker Consortium.\n\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admissions to the University of Pennsylvania is considered by *US News* to be \"most selective\". Admissions officials consider a student's GPA to be a very important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation.[167] Admission is need-blind for U.S., Canadian, and Mexican applicants.[168]\n\n\nFor the class of 2026, entering in Fall 2022, the university received 54,588 applications.[169] *The Atlantic* also ranked Penn among the 10 most selective schools in the country. At the graduate level, based on admission statistics from *U.S. News & World Report*, Penn's most selective programs include its law school, the health care schools (medicine, dental medicine, nursing, veterinary), and Wharton business school.\n\n\n\n\n\nFall first-year statistics, by year\n|  | 2022[170] | 2019[171] | 2018[172] | 2017[173] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Applicants\n | 54,588\n | 44,961\n | 44,491\n | 40,413\n |\n| Admits\n | 3,404\n | 3,446\n | 3,740\n | 3,757\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 6.24%\n | 7.66%\n | 8.41%\n | 9.30%\n |\n| Enrolled\n | 2,417\n | 2,400\n | 2,518\n | 2,456\n |\n| Yield | 68.18%\n | 69.65%\n | 67.33%\n | 65.37%\n |\n| SAT range\\*\n | 1510–1560\n | 1450–1560\n | 1440–1560\n | 1420–1560\n |\n| ACT range\\*\n | 34–36\n | 33–35\n | 32–35\n | 32–35\n |\n\n\n\\* SAT and ACT ranges are from the 25th to the 75th percentile.\n\n\n\n### Coordinated dual-degree, accelerated, interdisciplinary programs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Smith Walk with a view of Towne Building and the Engineering Quad\nPenn offers unique and specialized coordinated dual-degree (CDD) programs, which selectively award candidates degrees from multiple schools at the university upon completion of graduation criteria of both schools in addition to program-specific programs and senior capstone projects. Additionally, there are accelerated and interdisciplinary programs offered by the university. These undergraduate programs include:\n\n\n\n* Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business[174]\n* Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology (M&T)[175]\n* Roy and Diana Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management (LSM)[176]\n* Nursing and Health Care Management (NHCM)[177]\n* Roy and Diana Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER)[178]\n* Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences (MLS)[179]\n* Singh Program in Networked and Social Systems Engineering (NETS)[180]\n* Digital Media Design (DMD)[181]\n* Computer and Cognitive Science: Artificial Intelligence[182]\n* Accelerated 7-Year Bio-Dental Program[183]\n* Accelerated 6-Year Law and Medicine Program[184]\n\n\nDual-degree programs that lead to the same multiple degrees without participation in the specific above programs are also available. Unlike CDD programs, \"dual degree\" students fulfill requirements of both programs independently without the involvement of another program. Specialized dual-degree programs include Liberal Studies and Technology as well as an Artificial Intelligence: Computer and Cognitive Science Program. Both programs award a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Also, the Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences allows its students to either double major in the sciences or submatriculate and earn both a BA and an MS in four years. The most recent Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER) was first offered for the class of 2016. A joint program of Penn's School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, VIPER leads to dual Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees by combining majors from each school.\n\n\nFor graduate programs, Penn offers many formalized double degree graduate degrees such as a joint J.D./MBA and maintains a list of interdisciplinary institutions, such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, and the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science.\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice, commonly known as Penn SP2, is a school of social policy and social work that offers degrees in a variety of subfields, in addition to several dual degree programs and sub-matriculation programs.[185][186][187] Penn SP2's vision is: \"The passionate pursuit of social innovation, impact and justice.\"[188]\n\n\nOriginally named the School of Social Work, SP2 was founded in 1908 and is a graduate school of the University of Pennsylvania. The school specializes in research, education, and policy development in relation to both social and economic issues.[189][190]\n\n\nThe School of Veterinary Medicine offers five dual-degree programs, combining the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (VMD) with a Master of Social Work (MSW), Master of Environmental Studies (MES), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Master of Public Health (MPH) or Masters in Business Administration (MBA) degree. The Penn Vet dual-degree programs are meant to support veterinarians planning to engage in interdisciplinary work in the areas of human health, environmental health, and animal health and welfare.[191]\n\n\n\n### Academic medical center and biomedical research complex[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founded in 1751 by Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Bond, Pennsylvania Hospital is now part of University of Pennsylvania Health System and is the earliest established hospital in the United States with the country's oldest surgical amphitheater.\nIn 2018, the university's nursing school was ranked number one by Quacquarelli Symonds.[192] That year, Quacquarelli Symonds also ranked Penn's school of Veterinary Medicine sixth.[193] In 2019, the Perelman School of Medicine was named the third-best medical school for research in *U.S. News & World Report's* 2020 ranking.[194]\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania Health System, also known as UPHS, is a multi-hospital health system headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned by Trustees of University of Pennsylvania. UPHS and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania together constitute **Penn Medicine**, a clinical and research entity of the University of Pennsylvania. UPHS hospitals include the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania,[195] Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, Pennsylvania Hospital, Chester County Hospital, Lancaster General Hospital, and Princeton Medical Center.[196] Penn Medicine owns and operates the first hospital in the United States, the Pennsylvania Hospital.[197] It is also home to America's first surgical amphitheatre[198] and its first medical library.[199]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Pennsylvania Hospital as painted by Pavel Svinyin in 1811\n* ![](image)\n\nPerelman School of Medicine\n* ![](image)\n\nPenn School of Dental Medicine\n* ![](image)\n\nHospital of the University of Pennsylvania (facing northwest towards front entrance)\n* ![](image)\n\nPenn owned Princeton Medical Center, eastern facade\n\n\n## Research and discoveries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer, was founded at Penn in 1946\n![](image)Claudia Cohen Hall, formerly Logan Hall, home of the College of Arts and Sciences and former home of the Wharton School and originally, the medical school\nPenn is classified as an \"R1\" doctoral university: \"Highest research activity.\"[200] Its economic impact on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for 2015 amounted to $14.3 billion.[201] Penn's research expenditures in the 2018 fiscal year were $1.442 billion, the fourth largest in the U.S.[202] In fiscal year 2019 Penn received $582.3 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health.[203]\n\n\nPenn's research centers often span two or more disciplines. In the 2010–2011 academic year, five interdisciplinary research centers were created or substantially expanded; these include the Center for Health-care Financing,[204] the Center for Global Women's Health at the Nursing School,[205] the $13 million Morris Arboretum's Horticulture Center,[206] the $15 million Jay H. Baker Retailing Center at Wharton[207] and the $13 million Translational Research Center at Penn Medicine.[208] With these additions, Penn now counts 165 research centers hosting a research community of over 4,300 faculty and over 1,100 postdoctoral fellows, 5,500 academic support staff and graduate student trainees.[8] To further assist the advancement of interdisciplinary research President Amy Gutmann established the \"Penn Integrates Knowledge\" title awarded to selected Penn professors \"whose research and teaching exemplify the integration of knowledge\".[209] These professors hold endowed professorships and joint appointments between Penn's schools.\n\n\nPenn is also among the most prolific producers of doctoral students. With 487 PhDs awarded in 2009, Penn ranks third in the Ivy League, only behind Columbia and Cornell (Harvard did not report data).[210] It also has one of the highest numbers of post-doctoral appointees (933 in number for 2004–2007), ranking third in the Ivy League (behind Harvard and Yale) and tenth nationally.[211]\n\n\nIn most disciplines Penn professors' productivity is among the highest in the nation and first in the fields of epidemiology, business, communication studies, comparative literature, languages, information science, criminal justice and criminology, social sciences and sociology.[212] According to the National Research Council nearly three-quarters of Penn's 41 assessed programs were placed in ranges including the top 10 rankings in their fields, with more than half of these in ranges including the top five rankings in these fields.[213]\n\n\nPenn's research tradition has historically been complemented by innovations that shaped higher education. In addition to establishing the first medical school, the first university teaching hospital, the oldest continuously operating degree-granting program in chemical engineering,[214] the first business school, and the first student union, Penn was also the cradle of other significant developments.\n\n\nIn 1852, Penn Law was the first law school in the nation to publish a law journal still in existence (then called *The American Law Register,* now the *Penn Law Review*, one of the most cited law journals in the world).[215] Under the deanship of William Draper Lewis, the law school was also one of the first schools to emphasize legal teaching by full-time professors instead of practitioners, a system that is still followed today.[216]\n\n\nThe Wharton School was home to several pioneering developments in business education. It established the first research center in a business school in 1921 and the first center for entrepreneurship center in 1973[217] and it regularly introduced novel curricula for which *BusinessWeek* wrote, \"Wharton is on the crest of a wave of reinvention and change in management education\".[218][219] The university has also contributed major advancements in the fields of economics and management. Among the many discoveries are conjoint analysis, widely used as a predictive tool especially in market research, Simon Kuznets's method of measuring Gross National Product,[220] the Penn effect (the observation that consumer price levels in richer countries are systematically higher than in poorer ones) and the \"Wharton Model\"[221] developed by Nobel-laureate Lawrence Klein to measure and forecast economic activity. The idea behind Health Maintenance Organizations also belonged to Penn professor Robert Eilers, who put it into practice during then-President Nixon's health reform in the 1970s.[220]\n\n\nSeveral major scientific discoveries have also taken place at Penn. The university is probably best known as the place where the first general-purpose electronic computer (ENIAC) was born in 1946 at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering.[222] It was here also where the world's first spelling and grammar checkers were created, as well as the popular COBOL programming language.[222]\n\n\nPenn can also boast some of the most important discoveries in the field of medicine. The dialysis machine used as an artificial replacement for lost kidney function was conceived and devised out of a pressure cooker by William Inouye while he was still a student at Penn Med;[223] the Rubella and Hepatitis B vaccines were developed at Penn;[223] the discovery of cancer's link with genes, cognitive therapy, Retin-A (the cream used to treat acne), Resistin, the Philadelphia gene (linked to chronic myelogenous leukemia) and the technology behind PET Scans were all discovered by Penn Med researchers.[223] More recent gene research has led to the discovery of the (a) genes for fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation; (b) spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, a disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting; (c) Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the hands, feet and limbs;[223] and (d)\ngenetically engineered T cells used to treat lymphoblastic leukemia and refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma.[224][225] Another contribution to medicine was made by Ralph L. Brinster (Penn faculty member since 1965) who developed the scientific basis for in vitro fertilization and the transgenic mouse at Penn and was awarded the National Medal of Science in 2010.\n\n\nPenn professors Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa invented a conductive polymer process that earned them the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The theory of superconductivity was also partly developed at Penn, by then-faculty member John Robert Schrieffer (along with John Bardeen and Leon Cooper).\n\n\n\n## Academic profile and

& World Report*'s 2022 rankings place Penn seventh among national universities in the United States[242][243] and Center for World University Rankings' (\"CWUR\") 2020/2021 survey also ranks Penn as the eighth best university in the world.[244] The Princeton Review included Penn in its Dream Colleges list in 2015.[245] As reported by *USA Today*, Penn was ranked first in the United States by College Factual for 2015.[246] In 2023, Penn was ranked as having the 7th happiest students in the United States (the highest in the Ivy League).[247][248]\n\n\nIn their 2021 edition, Penn was ranked tenth in the nation by QS (Quacquarelli Symonds).[249] In the 2020 edition, Penn was ranked 15th in the world by the *QS World University Rankings*[250] and in 2019, 17th by the *Academic Ranking of World Universities* (ARWU) and 12th by the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*. In 2019, it ranked 12th among the universities around the world by *SCImago Institutions Rankings*.[251] According to the 2015 ARWU ranking, Penn is also the eighth- and ninth-best university in the world for economics/business and social sciences studies, respectively.[252] University of Pennsylvania ranked 12th among 300 Best World Universities in 2012 compiled by Human Resources & Labor Review (HRLR) on Measurements of World's Top 300 Universities Graduates' Performance.[253]\n\n\nThe Center for Measuring University Performance places Penn in the first tier of the United States' top research universities (tied with Columbia, MIT and Stanford), based on research expenditures, faculty awards, PhD granted and other academic criteria.[254] Penn was also ranked 18th of all U.S. colleges and universities in terms of R&D expenditures in fiscal year 2013 by the National Science Foundation.[255] The High Impact Universities research performance index ranks Penn eighth in the world, whereas the 2010 Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities (published by the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan) ranks Penn 11th in the world for 2007,[256] 2008[257] and 2010[258] and ninth for 2009.[259]\n\n\nThe Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers measures universities' research productivity, research impact, and research excellence based on the scientific papers published by their academic staff. The SCImago Institutions Rankings World Report 2012, which ranks world universities, national institutions and academies in terms of research output, ranks Penn seventh nationally among U.S. universities (2nd in the Ivy League behind Harvard) and 28th in the world overall (the first being France's French National Centre for Scientific Research).[260]\n\n\nThe Mines ParisTech International Professional Ranking, which ranks universities on the basis of the number of alumni listed among CEOs in the 500 largest worldwide companies, ranks Penn 11th worldwide and second nationally behind Harvard.[261] According to a *U.S. News* article in 2010, Penn is tied for second (tied with Dartmouth College and Tufts University) for the number of undergraduate alumni who are current Fortune 100 CEOs.[262] *Forbes* ranked Penn 17th, based on a variety of criteria.[263] In 2022, Poets & Quants ranked the undergraduate Wharton business school as the top business school in the nation for the fifth year in a row.[264]\n\n\n\n#### Graduate and professional programs[edit]\n\n\nAmong its professional schools, the school of education was ranked number one in 2021 and Wharton School of Business was ranked number one in 2022,[265] the communication, dentistry, medicine, nursing, law and veterinary medicine schools rank in the top 5 nationally.[266] Penn's Law School was ranked number 4 in 2023[240] and Design school, and its School of Social Policy and Practice are ranked in the top 10[266]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nEthnic breakdown of enrollment\n| Ethnic enrollment,fall 2018[267] | Number (percentage)of undergraduates\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| African American | 715 (7.1%)\n |\n| Native American | 12 (0.1%)\n |\n| Asian American andPacific Islander | 2,084 (20.7%)\n |\n| Hispanic andLatino American | 1,044 (10.4%)\n |\n| White | 4,278 (42.6%)\n |\n| International | 1,261 (12.6%)\n |\n| Two or more races,non-Hispanic\n | 460 (4.6%)\n |\n| Unknown\n | 179 (1.8%)\n |\n| Total\n | 10,033 (100%)\n |\n\n\n### Demographics and diversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aaron Albert Mossell II, the first African American graduate of Penn Law School, at his 1888 graduation\n![](image)Julian Abele, the first African American graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Design\n![](image)Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, the first African American woman to receive a Ph.D. in economics in the United States\n![](image)Edgar Fahs Smith, University of Pennsylvania provost from 1911 through 1920\nJonathan and Philip Gayienquitioga, two brothers of the Mohawk Nation,[268] were recruited by Benjamin Franklin to attend the Academy of Philadelphia,[269] making them the first Native Americans at Penn when they enrolled in 1755.[270] Moses Levy, the first Jewish student, enrolled in 1769 (and was also elected Penn's first Jewish trustee in 1802, serving to 1826).[271] Joseph M. Urquiola (aka José María de Urquiola y Fernández de Zúñiga), School of Medicine class of 1829 was the first Latino (from Cuba)[272][273][274] and Auxencio Maria Pena, School of Medicine class of 1836, was the first South American (from Venezuela)[275] to graduate from Penn.\n\n\nWilliam Adger, James Brister, and Nathan Francis Mossell in 1879 were the first African Americans to enroll at Penn. Adger was the first African American to graduate from the college at Penn (1883),[276] and when Brister graduated from the School of Dental Medicine (Penn Dental) (class of 1881), he was the first African American to earn a degree at Penn.[277] Mossell was first African American to graduate from Penn Med (1882)[278] (and had a brother, Aaron Albert Mossell II who was the first African American graduate of University of Pennsylvania Law School (in 1888) and [279] niece, Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, Albert's daughter, who not only was first African American woman to graduate from Penn Law (in 1927) and be admitted to practice law in Pennsylvania, but prior to such noteworthy accomplishments was the first African American woman to earn a PhD in the United States (from Penn in 1922)).[280] Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander's uncle (via her mother's Tanner family), Lewis Baxter Moore, in 1896 became the first person of African descent to earn a doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania and only the fifth black person in the United States to earn a doctor of philosophy degree[281] and in 1899 founded the Teachers College (now known as the School of Education) of Howard University and served as its dean continuously from 1899 through September 1920.[282]\n\n\nTosui Imadate was the first person of Asian descent to graduate from Penn (College [283] Class of 1879).[284] In 1877, Imadate became the first Asian member of a fraternity at Penn when he became a brother at Phi Kappa Psi.[285] In a quote from a portion of a letter published in December 1880 issue of *The Crescent*, Imadate is described by a Phi Kappa Psi brother as a \"brother member of Penn's I [iota] chapter of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, who is a professor in college at Kiota [(Kyoto, Japan)]\".[286][287]\n\n\nFuji Tsukamoto, Penn Graduate School Class of 1889, became the first woman of Asian descent to matriculate at Penn when she started her study of biology and botany in 1885 and, like Tosui Imadate, also taught at Kyoto college in Japan.[288]\n\n\nMary Alice Bennett and Anna H. Johnson were in 1880 the first women to enroll in a Penn degree-granting program and Bennett was the first woman to receive a degree from Penn, which was a PhD.[289][290][272]\n\n\nJulian Abele in 1902 was the first African American to graduate from University of Pennsylvania School of Design (then named Department of Architecture) and was elected as the president of Penn's Architectural Society.[291] Abele won a 1901 student competition where he designed a Beaux Arts pedestrian gateway that was built and still stands on the campus of Haverford College,[292] The Edward B. Conklin Memorial Gate at the Railroad Avenue entrance to Haverford College.[293] Abele contributed to the design of more than 400 buildings, including the Widener Memorial Library at Harvard University (1912–1915), Philadelphia's Central Library (1917–1927),[294] and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1914–1928).[295] and was the primary designer of the west campus of Duke University (1924–1954).[296] Duke honored Abele by prominently displaying his portrait, the first portrait of an African American to be displayed on the campus.[297]\n\n\nSadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, paternal niece of Nathan Francis Mossell and maternal niece of Lewis Baxter Moore, was the first African American to receive a PhD in economics in the United States (and third black woman to earn one in the United States in any subject)[298] and first from Penn in 1921, the first African-American woman to receive a law degree from Penn Law in 1927, and the first African-American woman to practice law in Pennsylvania.[280]\n\n\nAlan L. Hart, who earned a master's degree at Penn Med in radiology (class of 1928),[299][note 12] was born in 1890 and publicly identified as a female, Alberta Lucille Hart, through much of 1917, the year Hart transitioned to being a man by having a hysterectomy, one of the first in the United States to be performed to help a person become a trans man, and lived the rest of his life as a man.[300] Hart, Penn's most prominent transgender alumnus in the first half of the twentieth century, was a pioneer in using x-ray photography to detect tuberculosis, allowing the identification of asymptomatic TB carriers (seventy-five percent of the total infected), permitting treatment of patients before they had complications, and allowing for separation of TB patients from others to stop the spread of one of the more infectious deadly diseases known to humanity.[299]\n\n\nThe first openly LGBTQ+ organization funded by Penn was formed in 1972 by Kiyoshi Kuromiya, a Benjamin Franklin Scholar and Penn alumnus from the College's class of 1966, when he created the Gay Coffee Hour, which met every week on campus and was also open to non-students and served as an alternative space to gay bars for gay people of all ages.[301] Penn funded the Gay Coffee House program (via a grant from the student government), which was held in Houston Hall at six o'clock in the evening every Wednesday and attracted, on average, roughly sixty people of all ages with roughly \"one-quarter to one-third women and two-thirds to three-quarters men.\"[302] In March 2023, Penn announced a first in the United States LGBTQ+ scholar in residence after a $2-million gift.[303]\n\n\nAs detailed in part above, by the first decades of the twentieth century, Penn made strides and took an active interest in attracting diverse students from around the globe. Two examples of such action occurred in 1910. Penn's first director of publicity, created a recruiting brochure, translated into Spanish, with approximately 10,000 copies circulated throughout Latin America. That same year, the Penn-affiliated organization, the Cosmopolitan Club, started an annual tradition of hosting an opening \"smoker\", which attracted students from 40 nations who were formally welcomed to the university by then-vice provost Edgar Fahs Smith (who the following year would start a ten-year tenure as provost)[304][305][306][307][308] who spoke about how Penn wanted to \"bring together students of different countries and break down misunderstandings existing between them\".[272]\n\n\nThe success of such efforts were reported in 1921 when the official Penn publicity department reported that\n\n\n\n\n> We have an enrollment at the University of 12,000 students, who have registered from every State in the Union, and 253 students from at least fifty foreign countries and foreign territories, including India, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and practically all the British possessions except Ireland; every Latin American country, and most of the Oriental and European nations.\n> \n> — George E. Nitzsche, 1921[84]\n> \n\n\nOf those accepted for admission in 2018, 48 percent were Asian, Hispanic, African-American or Native American.[8] Fourteen percent of entering undergraduates in 2018 were international students.[8] The composition of international first-year students in 2018 was: 46% from Asia; 15% from Africa and the Middle East; 16% from Europe; 14% from Canada and Mexico; 8% from the Caribbean, Central America and South America; 5% from Australia and the Pacific Islands.[8] The acceptance rate for international students admission in 2018 was 493 out of 8,316 (6.7%).[8] In 2018, 55% of all enrolled students were women.[8]\n\n\nIn the last few decades, Jewish enrollment has been declining. Circa 1999 about 28% of the students were Jewish.[309] In early 2020, 1,750 Penn undergraduate students were Jewish,[310] which would be approximately 17%[311] of the some 10,000 undergrads for 2019–20.\n\n\n\n### Penn Face and behavioral health[edit]\n\n\nThe university's social pressure surrounding academic perfection, extreme competitiveness, and nonguaranteed readmission have created what is known as \"Penn Face\": students put on a façade of confidence and happiness while enduring mental turmoil.[312][313][314][315][316] Stanford University calls this phenomenon \"Duck Syndrome.\"[315][317] In recent years, mental health has become an issue on campus with ten student suicides between the years of 2013 to 2016.[318] The school responded by launching a task force.[319][320] The most widely covered case of Penn Face has been Madison Holleran.[321][322] In 2018, initiatives were enacted to ameliorate mental health problems, such as requiring sophomores to live on campus and the daily closing of Huntsman Hall at 2:00 a.m.[323][324] The university's suicide rate was the catalyst for a 2018 state bill, introduced by Governor Tom Wolf, to raise Pennsylvania's standards for university suicide prevention.[325] The university's efforts to address mental health on campus came into the national spotlight again in September 2019 when the director of the university's counseling services died by suicide six months after starting the position.[326]\n\n\n\n### Selected student organizations[edit]\n\n\nOldest organization\n![](image)Philomathean Society graduation diploma For Isaac Norton Jr., 1858\n![](image)The Philomathean Society Presidential Library named after United States President and Penn Med alumnus William Henry Harrison\nThe Philomathean Society, founded in 1813, is one of the United States' oldest collegiate literary societies and continues to host lectures and intellectual events open to the public.[327]\n\n\n\n*The Daily Pennsylvanian*\nMain article: The Daily Pennsylvanian\n\n![](image)34th Street logo in 2017\n*The Daily Pennsylvanian* is an independent, student-run newspaper, which has been published daily since it was founded in 1885.[328] The newspaper went unpublished from May 1943 to November 1945 due to World War II.[328] In 1984, the university lost all editorial and financial control of *The Daily Pennsylvanian* (also known as *The DP*) when the newspaper became its own corporation.[328] *The Daily Pennsylvanian* has won the Pacemaker Award administered by the Associated Collegiate Press multiple times, most recently in 2019.[329][330] The *DP* also publishes a weekly arts and culture magazine called *34th Street Magazine*.\n\n\n*The Daily Pennsylvanian* also operates three principal websites, thedp.com, 34st.com, and underthebutton.com, and publishes opinion, news, and sports blogs. It has received various collegiate journalism awards.\n\n\n\nAcademic organizations\nSee also: Penn Debate Society and Penn History Review\n\nThe Penn Debate Society (PDS), founded in 1984 as the Penn Parliamentary Debate Society, is Penn's debate team, which competes regularly on the American Parliamentary Debate Association and the international British Parliamentary circuit.[331]\n\n\nThe *Penn History Review* is a journal, published twice a year, through the Department of History, for undergraduate historical research, by and for undergraduates, and founded in 1991.[332][333][334]\n\n\n\nLGBTQ+ organizations\nPenn has been ranked as the number one LGBTQ+ friendly school in the country.[335] Penn's LGBTQ+ center is second oldest in the nation[336] and oldest in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as it has been serving the LGBTQ+ community since 1979 by providing support and guidance through 25 groups (including Penn J-Bagel a Jewish LGBTQ+ group, the Lambda Alliance a general LGBTQ social organization, and oSTEM a group for LGBTQ people in STEM fields).[337] Penn offers courses in Sexuality and Gender Studies which allows students to discover and learn queer theory, history of sexual norms, and other gender orientation related courses.[338] The first Penn funded LGBTQ+ organization was formed in 1972 by \"Steve\" Kiyoshi Kuromiya (Penn college class of 1966) when he created the Gay Coffee Hour, which met every week on campus and served as an alternative space to gay bars for gay people of all ages.[301] Penn funded the Gay Coffee House via a grant from the student government and the weekly event was held in Houston Hall Wednesday evenings.[302]\n\n\n\n#### Penn Electric Racing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn Electric Racing unveiled REV8 on March 31, 2023, in front of the Benjamin Franklin statue in front of College Hall.\nPenn Electric Racing is the university's Formula SAE (FSAE) team, competing in the international electric vehicle (EV) competition.

In 2015, PER built and raced their first racecar, REV1, at the Lincoln Nebraska FSAE competition, winning first place.[339] The team repeated their success with their next two racecars: REV2 won second place in 2016,[340] and REV3 won first place in 2017.[341]\n\n\n\n\n\nPlacement of PER in overall category of FSAE competitions, 2015–present\n| Year\n | Competition\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2015\n | Electric 2015[339] | 1\n |\n| 2016\n | Electric 2016[340] | 2\n |\n| 2017\n | Electric 2017[341] | 1\n |\n| 2018\n | Electric 2018[342] | 11\n |\n| 2019\n | Electric 2019[343] | 3\n |\n| 2020\n | Competition cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic[344][*failed verification*] | —\n |\n| 2021\n | Knowledge EV 2021[345] | 2\n |\n| 2022\n | Michigan June 2022 Electric[346] | 9\n |\n\n\n### Performing arts organizations[edit]\n\n\nPenn is home to numerous organizations that promote the arts, from dance to spoken word, jazz to stand-up comedy, theatre, a cappella and more. The Performing Arts Council (PAC) oversees 45 student organizations in these areas.[347] The PAC has four subcommittees: A Cappella Council; Dance Arts Council; Singer, Musicians, and Comedians (SMAC); and Theatre Arts Council (TAC-e).\n\n\n\n#### Penn Glee Club[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn Glee Club's 1915–1916 academic year membership photo\nThe University of Pennsylvania Glee Club, founded in 1862, is tied for fourth oldest continually running glee clubs in the United States[348] and the oldest performing arts group at the University of Pennsylvania. Each year, the Penn Glee Club writes and produces a fully staged, Broadway-style production with an eclectic mix of Penn standards, Broadway classics, classical favorites, and pop hits, highlighting choral singing from all genders (as of April 9, 2021, it merged[349] with Penn Sirens, a previously all female chorale group), clever plots and dialogue, dancing, humor, colorful sets and costumes, and a pit band.[350] The Glee Club draws its singing members from the undergraduate and graduate students (and men and women from the Penn community are also called upon to fill roles in the pit band and technical staff when the club is involved with theatrical productions). The Penn Glee Club has traveled to nearly all 50 states in the United States and over 40 nations and territories on five continents.[351] Since the 1950s, Penn Glee Club has appeared on national television with such celebrities as Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Stewart, Ed McMahon, Carol Lawrence, and Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco and has been showcased on television specials such as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and at professional sporting events for The Philadelphia Phillies where club sung the National Anthem at the 1993 National League Championship Series. Since its first performance at the White House for President Calvin Coolidge in 1926, the club has sung for numerous heads of state and world leaders. One of the highlights of 1989 was the club's performance for Polish President Lech Wałęsa. Bruce Montgomery, its best-known and longest-serving director, led the club from 1956 until 2000.[352]\n\n\n\n#### Penn Band[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The University of Pennsylvania Band\n\n![](image)The University of Pennsylvania Band at the 2019 homecoming game\nThe University of Pennsylvania Band has been a part of student life since 1897.[353] The Penn Band presently mainly performs at football and basketball games as well as university functions (e.g. commencement and convocation) throughout the year but in past it was known not only as the first college band to perform at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade but performed with notable musicians, including John Philip Sousa, members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, the U.S. Marine Band (\"The President's Own\"), Doc Severinsen of *The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson*. Beginning in the late 1920s and 1930s Penn Band recorded with the Victor Talking Machine Company (RCA-Victor Company) and was nationally broadcast on WABC (AM). In 1977, Penn Band performed with Chuck Barris of The Gong Show and in 1980 opened for Penn alumnus Maury Povich in his eponymously named show.\n\n\nPenn Band has performed for Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco (sister and aunt to number of alumni), alumnus and District Attorney and Mayor of Philadelphia, and Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell, Vice President Al Gore, Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson and Ronald Reagan, and Polish dissident and President Lech Wałęsa. By the 1970s, however, Penn Band had begun moving away from the traditional corps style and is now a scramble band. The first one hundred years of the organization's history was described in a book from Arcadia Publishing: *Images of America:The University of Pennsylvania Band* (2006).[353]\n\n\n\n#### Penn's a cappella community[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn Masala performs in the Blue Room of the White House in October 2009 on invitation from President Barack Obama.\nThe A Cappella Council (ACK) is composed of 14 a cappella groups. Penn's a cappella groups entertain audiences with repertoires including pop, rock, R&B, jazz, Hindi, and Chinese songs.[354]\nACK is also home to Off The Beat, which has received the most contemporary a cappella recording awards of any collegiate group in the United States and the most features on the *Best of College A Cappella* albums.[355] Penn Masala, formed in 1996, is world's oldest[356][357] and premier[358][359] South Asian a cappella group based in an American university, which has performed for Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Henry Kissinger, Ban Ki Moon, Farooq Abdullah, Imran Khan, Rajkumar Hirani, A.R. Rahman, Narendra Modi[360] and Sunidhi Chauhan, had their a cappella version of Nazia Hassan's Urdu classic \"Aap Jaisa Koi\", (originally from the movie *Qurbani*) sung in the movie American Desi.[361]\n\n\nPenn alumni Elizabeth Banks (class of 1996) and Max Handelman (Banks' husband, class of 1995) invited Masala to appear in *Pitch Perfect 2*, as Banks reported that Penn's a capella community inspired the film series starring and/or produced by Banks and Handleman.[362]\n\n\n\n#### Comedy organizations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mask and Wig clubhouse, also known as the Welsh Coachhouse and Stable, at 310 South Quince Street in Philadelphia; the stable was built between 1843 and 1853, remodeled into a clubhouse by Wilson Eyre Jr. in 1894, altered by Eyre in 1901. The murals were developed by Maxfield Parrish.\nMask and Wig, a club founded in 1889, was (until fall of 2021[363]) the oldest all-male musical comedy troupe in the country. In 2021 the club voted to become gender-inclusive, with auditions open to all undergraduates: male, female, and non-binary.\n\n\nBloomers comedy group, founded in 1978, is the \"... nation's first collegiate all-women musical and sketch comedy troupe...\".[364]\nBloomers was founded at Penn by Joan Harrison.[365] In the mid teens, Bloomers revised its constitution to be open to \"... anyone who does not identify as a cisgender man...\".[366] \nand now accepts all persons from under-represented gender identities who perform comedy.[367][368] Bloomers performs sketches and elaborate shows almost every semester. The comedy troupe is named after bloomers, the once popular long, loose fitting under garment, gathered at the ankle, worn under a short skirt (developed in the mid 19th century as a healthy comfortable alternative to the heavy, constricting dresses then worn by American women), which were in turn, named after Amelia Jenks Bloomer. Bloomers most well known performing alumna is Vanessa Bayer, formerly of Saturday Night Live and is SNL's longest-serving female cast member.[369]\n\n\n\n### Religious and spiritual organizations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains academic boosterism which primarily serves to praise or promote the subject** and may be a sign of a conflict of interest. Please improve this article by removing peacock terms, weasel words, and other promotional material. *(July 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe following religious and spiritual organizations have a significant on campus presence at Penn:\n\n\n(A) Mainstream Protestantism:\nDating back to 1857, The Christian Association (a.k.a. The CA), is composed primarily of students from Mainline Protestant backgrounds.[370] Historically, the CA ran several foreign missions including one in China[371] and for decades ran a camp for socio-economically disadvantaged children from Philadelphia.[372] At present the CA occupies part of the parsonage at Tabernacle United Church of Christ.[373]\n\n\n(B) Judaism:\nOrganized Jewish life did not begin on campus in earnest until the start of 20th century.[374] Jewish Life on campus is centered at Penn branch of Hillel International,[375][311] which inspires students to explore Judaism, creates patterns of Jewish living that can be sustained after graduation, provides religious communities, promotes educational initiatives, social justice projects, social and cultural opportunities, and groups focusing on Israel education and politics, and hosts a Kosher Penn approved dining hall (supervised by the Community Kashrus of Greater Philadelphia).[376] In addition to Hillel, the other major Jewish organization with significant impact on Penn's campus is The Chabad Lubavitch House at Penn (founded in 1980[377]), which, among other activities, brings together Jewish college students with noted Jewish academics for in-depth discussions and debate.[378]\n\n\n(C) Roman Catholicism:\nThe Penn Newman Catholic Center (the Newman Center), founded in 1893 (as the first Newman Center in the country) with the mission of supporting students, faculty, and staff in their religious endeavors. The organization brings prominent Christian figures to campus, including Rev. Thomas \"Tom\" J. Hagan, OSFS, who worked in the Newman Center and founded Haiti-based non-profit Hands Together;[379] and James Martin SJ (Wharton undergraduate class of 1982[380]). Father Martin, an editor-at-large of the Jesuit magazine *America*,[381] and frequent commentator on the life and teachings of Jesus and Ignatian spirituality, is especially well known for his outreach to the LGBT community, which has drawn a strong backlash from parts of the Catholic Church, but has provided comfort to Penn students and other members of Roman Catholic community who wish to stay connected with their faith and identify as LGBQT.[382][383][384]\n\n\n(D) Hinduism and Jainism:\nPenn funds (via the Graduate and Professional Student Assembly or similar undergraduate organization) a variety of official clubs focused on India including a number focused on students who are Hindu or Jain such as: (1) 'Pan-Asian American Community House (PAACH)', a center for students to celebrate South Asian, East Asian, Southeast Asian, culture and religion,[385] (2) 'Rangoli – The South Asian Association at Penn' that educates and informs Penn students (mainly graduate and professional students) with ancestry and/or interest in South Asia whose goals include a desire to \"rekindle the spirit of community\" through events,[386] and (3) 'Penn Hindu & Jain Association', a student-run official club at Penn that has 80 to 110 student members and an extensive alumni network, dedicated to raise awareness of the Hindu and Jain faiths and foster further development of these communities in the greater Philadelphia area by providing a variety of services and hosting a number of events such as Holi Festival (which has been held annually at Penn since 1993[387][388][389]) and \". . . aims to be a home to anyone seeking to explore their spiritual, religious, or social interests.\"[390]\n\n\n(E) Islam:\nIn 1963, the Muslim Students' Association (MSA National) and Penn chapter of MSA National were founded to facilitate Muslim life among students on college campuses.[391][392] Penn MSA was established to help Penn Muslims build faith and community by fostering a space under the guidance of Islamic principles[393][394] and towards that goal Penn MSA supports mission of its related umbrella organization, Islamic Society of North America, to \"foster the development of the Muslim community, interfaith relations, civic engagement, and better understandings of Islam.\"[395] The Muslim Life Program at Penn also provides such support and helped cause Penn (in January 2017) to hire its first full-time Muslim chaplain, the co-president of the Association of Campus Muslim Chaplains, Sister Patricia Anton (whose background includes working with Muslim, interfaith, academic and peace-building institutions such as Islamic Society of North America and Islamic Relief). Chaplain Anton's mandate includes supporting and guiding the Penn Muslim community to foster further development of such community by creating a welcoming environment that provides Penn Muslim community opportunities to intellectually and spiritually engage with Islam.[396] Penn also has a residential house, the Muslim Life Residential Program, which provides a live/learn environment focused on the appreciation of Islamic culture, food, history, and practice, and shows its Penn student residents how Islam is deeply integrated in the culture of Philadelphia so they may appreciate how Islam influences daily life.[397]\n\n\n(F) Buddhism:\nPenn has a Buddhist chaplain[398][399] (as well as chaplains of other faiths) and funds the Penn Meditation and Buddhism Club, which (1) is dedicated to helping Penn students practice mindfulness and meditation and learning about Buddhism, (2) conducts weekly meetings that begin with a guided meditation and are followed by discussions of topic(s) relating to mindfulness and Buddhism, and (3) organizes other activities such as ramen nights and weekend meditation retreats to the local Won Buddhism center.[400]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers\n\nPenn's sports teams are nicknamed the Quakers, but the teams are often also referred to as The Red and Blue as reflected in the popular song sung after every athletic contest where the Penn Band or other musical groups are present.[401][402] The athletes participate in the Ivy League and Division I (Division I FCS for football) in the NCAA. In recent decades, they often have been league champions in football (14 times from 1982 to 2010) and basketball (22 times from 1970 to 2006). The first athletic team at Penn was the cricket team, which formed in 1842 and played regularly through 1846, the year it lost its \"grounds\", and then only played intermittently until 1864, the year it played its first intercollegiate game (against Haverford College).[403] The rowing (or crew) team composed of Penn students but not officially representing Penn was formed in 1854 but did not compete against other colleges as official part of Penn until 1879. The rugby football team began to play against other colleges, most notably against College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1874 using a combination of association football (i.e. soccer) and rugby rules (the twenty players on each side were able to use their hands but were not able to pass or bat the ball forward).[404][405][406]\n\n\n\n### Cricket[edit]\n\n\nThe first University of Pennsylvania cricket team, reported to be the first cricket team in the United States composed exclusively of Americans,[407] was organized in 1842 by a member of Philadelphia's prominent Wister family, William Rotch Wister (class of 1846 for Bachelor of Arts and 1849 for Master of Arts).[408] Penn never possessed its own \"ground\" except in 1846 when it leased one day a week, for a total sum of $50, a \"ground\" (located east of the Delaware River).[409][note 13] From 1846 to 1860, there is little evidence of Penn playing cricket but just as Civil War began, Penn students resumed playing cricket matches between classes of Penn students.\n\n\nOn May 7, 1864, Penn played its first intercollegiate game against Haverford College[410][411] and then proceeded to play Haverford for three consecutive years until 1869, when the Haverford faculty banned cricket away from their college grounds.\n\n\nAfter Penn moved west of the Schuylkill River in 1872, Penn played cricket at one of the local clubs (Belmont Cricket Club, the closest to campus at 50th Street and Chester Avenue, Merion Cricket Club, and Germantown Cricket Club), or at Haverford College.[410] Though there is evidence of an occasional game during period 1870 through 1875, none were played against other colleges and there were no yearbook pictures for the three years after 1872 when Penn moved from Center City to University City. Starting in 1875 and through 1880, Penn fielded a varsity eleven, which played a few matches each year against opponents that included Haverford College and Columbia College.[412]\n\n\n\n![](image)George Patterson, president of the University of Pennsylvania cricket team in 1877[410]\nIn 1881, Penn, Harvard College, Haverford College, Princeton College (then known as College of New Jersey), and Columbia College formed The Intercollegiate Cricket Association,[411] which Cornell University later joined.[403] Penn won The Intercollegiate Cricket Association championship (the *de facto* national championship) 23 times (18 solo, 3 shared with Haverford and Harvard, 1 shared with Haverford and Cornell, and 1 shared with just Haverford) during the 44 years that The Intercollegiate Cricket Association existed (1881 through 1924).[413]\n\n\nIn the 1890s Penn's cricket team frequently toured Canada and the British Isles.[414] In July 1895 an international cricket match between Canada and the United States was played on the Manheim grounds in Germantown section of Philadelphia with six of the United States team being Penn student athletes and, in September of that year, past and then current members of Penn's varsity cricket team played past and then current members of the English cricket teams of Oxford and Cambridge resulting in Penn defeating the Oxford-Cambridge team by one hundred runs.[403] This was not surprising as in the last two and a half decades of the 19th century and first decade of the 20th century, Philadelphia was the center of cricket in the United States[415]\n\n\nCricket had gained in popularity among the upper class from their travels abroad and cricket clubs sprung up all across the Eastern Seaboard (even today Philadelphia still has three cricket clubs: the Philadelphia Cricket Club, the Merion Cricket Club, and the Germantown Cricket Club).\n\n\nPerhaps the university's most famous cricket player was George Patterson (class of 1888), who still holds the North American batting record and who went on to play for the professional Philadelphia Cricket Team.[416]\n\n\nFollowing the First World War, cricket began to experience a serious decline (as baseball became the preferred sport of the warmer months and Imperial Cricket Conference, Cricket's \"... international governing body and forerunner to the current International Cricket Conference (ICC), introduced a regulation making it clear that only countries within the British empire were welcome to compete\")[409] such that in 1924 Penn fielded its last team in the twentieth century. Starting in 2009, however, Penn once again fielded a cricket team, albeit club, that ended up being the first winner of a tournament for teams from the Ivies.[417]\n\n\n\n### Rowing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn's eight-oared crew in 1901, the first foreign crew to reach the final of the Grand Challenge Cup[418] at Henley Royal Regatta\n![](image)Joe Burk, Wharton School class of 1934 and crew coach from 1950 to 1969, was named the \"world's greatest oarsman\" in 1938[419]\nRowing at Penn dates back to at least 1854 with the founding of the University Barge Club. The university currently hosts both heavyweight and lightweight men's teams and an open weight women's team, all of which compete as part of the Eastern Sprints League. Ellis Ward was Penn's first intercollegiate crew coach from 1879 through 1912.[420] During the course of Ward's coaching career at Penn his \"... Red and Blue crews won 65 races, in about 150 starts.\"[421] Importantly, Ward coached Penn's 8-oared boat to the finals of the Grand Challenge Cup (the oldest and most prized trophy) at the Henley Royal Regatta (but in that final race was defeated by the champion Leander Club).[422]\n\n\nPenn Rowing has produced a long list of famous coaches and Olympians. Members of Penn crew team, rowers Sidney Jellinek, Eddie Mitchell, and coxswain, John G. Kennedy, won the bronze medal for the United States at 1924 Olympics.[423]\n\n\nJoe Burk (class of 1935) was captain of Penn crew team, winner of the Henley Diamond Sculls twice, named recipient of the James E. Sullivan Award for nation's best amateur athlete in 1939, and Penn coach from 1950 to 1969. The 1955 Men's Heavyweight 8, coached by Joe Burk, became one of only four American university crews in history to win the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. The outbreak of World War Two canceled the 1940 Olympics for which Burk was favored to win the gold medal.\n\n\nOther Penn Olympic athletes and or Penn coaches of such athletes include:\n(a) John Anthony Pescatore (who competed in the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games for the United States as stroke of the men's coxed eight which earned a bronze medal[424] and later competed at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games in the men's coxless pair),\n(b) Susan Francia (winner of gold medals as part of the women's 8 oared boat at 2008 Olympics and 2012 Olympics),\n(c) Regina Salmons (member of 2021 USA team),[425] \n(d) Rusty Callow, \n(e) Harry Parker,\n(f) Ted Nash,[423] and\n(g) John B. Kelly Jr., son of John B. Kelly Sr. (winner of three medals at 1920 Summer Olympics) and brother of Princess Grace of Monaco, was the second Penn Crew alumnus to win the James E. Sullivan Award[426] for being nation's best amateur athlete (in 1947), who was winner of a bronze medal at the 1956 Summer Olympics).\n\n\nThe Penn men's crew team won the National Collegiate Rowing Championship in 1991. A member of that team, Janusz Hooker (Wharton class of 1992)[427] won the bronze medal in Men's Quadruple Sculls for Australia at the 1996 Summer Olympics.[428] The Penn teams presently row out of College Boat Club, No.11 Boathouse Row.\n\n\n\n### Rugby[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 1878 Penn Rugby team[429]\n![](image)John Heisman, a University of Pennsylvania Law School class of 1892 alumnus and rugby football player, posing at Penn in 1891 holding elongated ellipsoidal rugby ball and gestures resembling the famed \"Heisman Pose\"[430]\n![](image)Lithograph of University of Pennsylvania rugby player in 1907\nThe Penn men's rugby football team is one of the oldest collegiate rugby teams in the United States. Indeed, Penn first fielded a team in mid-1870s playing by rules much closer to the rugby union and Association football code rules (relative to American football rules, as such American football rules had not yet been invented[404]). Among its earliest games was a game against College of New Jersey (which in 1895 changed its name to Princeton) played in Philadelphia on Saturday, November 11, 1876, which was less than two weeks before Princeton met on November 23, 1876, with Harvard and Columbia to confirm that all their games would be played using the rugby union rules.[431][404] Princeton and Penn played their November 1876 game per a combination of rugby (there were 20 players per side and players were able to touch the ball with their hands) and Association football codes. The rugby code influence was due, in part, to the fact that some of their students had been educated in English public schools.[432]\n\n\nAmong the prominent alumni to play in a 19th century version of rugby in which rules then did not allow forward passes or center snaps was John Heisman, namesake of the Heisman Trophy and an 1892 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[433]\n\n\nHeisman was instrumental in the first decade of the 20th century in changing the rules to more closely relate to the present rules of American football.[434] One of Heisman's teammates (who was unanimously voted Captain in the fall after Heisman graduated) was Harry Arista Mackey, Penn Law class of 1893[435] (who subsequently served as Mayor of Philadelphia from 1928 to 1932).[436]\n\n\nIn 1906, Rugby per Rugby Union code was reintroduced to Penn[437] (as Penn last played per Rugby Union Code in 1882 as Penn played rugby per a number of different rugby football rulebooks and codes from 1883 through 1890s[438]) by Frank Villeneuve Nicholson (Frank Nicholson (rugby union)) University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine (class of 1910),[439] who in 1904 had captained the Australian national rugby team in its match against England.[440]\n\n\n\nPenn played per rugby union code rules at least through 1912, contemporaneously with Penn playing American gridiron football. Evidence of such may be found in an October 22, 1910, *Daily Pennsylvanian* article (quoted below) and a yearbook photo[441] that rugby per rugby union code was played.\n\n\n> Such is the devotion to English rugby football on the part of University of Pennsylvania's students from New Zealand, Australia, and England that they meet on Franklin Field at 7 o'clock every morning and practice the game. The varsity track and football squads monopolize the field to such an extent that the early hours of the morning are the only ones during which the rugby enthusiasts can play. Any time except Friday, Saturday and Sunday, a squad of 25 men may be seen running through the hardest kind of practice after which they may divide into two teams and play a hard game. Once a week, captain CC Walton, ('11), dental, who hails from New Zealand, gives the enthusiastic players a blackboard talk in which he explains the intricacies of the game in detail.[442]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe player-coach of United States Olympic gold-winning rugby team at the 1924 Summer Olympics was Alan Valentine, who played rugby while at Penn (which he attended during 1921/1922 academic year) as he was getting a master's degree at Wharton.[443]\n\n\nThough Penn played rugby per rugby union rules from 1929 through 1934,[444] there is no indication that Penn had a rugby team from 1935 through 1959 when Penn men's rugby became permanent due to leadership of Harry \"Joe\" Edwin Reagan III[445] Penn's College class of 1962 and Penn Law class of 1965, who also went onto help create and incorporate (in 1975) and was Treasurer (in 1981) of USA Rugby and Oreste P. \"Rusty\" D'Arconte Penn's College class of 1966[446] Thus, with D'Arconte's hustle and Reagan's charisma and organizational skills, a team, which had fielded a side of fifteen intermittently from 1912 through 1960, became permanent.\n\n\nIn spring of 1984[447][448] Penn women's rugby, led by Social Chair Tamara Wayland (College class of 1985 who subsequently became the women's representative to and vice president of USA Rugby South from 1996 to 1998),[449] Club President Marianne Seligson, and Penn Law student Gigi Sohn,[450] began to compete. Penn women's rugby team is coached, as of 2020, by (a) Adam Dick,[451] a 300-level certified coach with over 15 years of rugby coaching experience including being the first coach of the first women's rugby team at the University of Arizona and who was a four-year starter at University of Arizona men's first XV rugby team and (b) Philly women's player Kate Hallinan.\n\n\nPenn's men's rugby team plays in the Ivy Rugby Conference[452] and have finished as runners-up in both 15s and 7s in the Conference and won the Ivy Rugby Tournament in 1992.[453] As of 2011[update], the club uses the state-of-the-art facilities at Penn Park. The Penn Quakers' rugby team played on national TV at the 2013 Collegiate Rugby Championship, a college rugby tournament that for number of years had been played each June at PPL Park (now known as Subaru Park) in Philadelphia and was broadcast live on NBC. In their inaugural year of participation, the Penn men's rugby team won the Shield Competition, beating local Big Five rival, Temple University, 17–12 in the final. In the semifinal match of that Shield Competition, Penn Rugby became the first Philadelphia team to beat a non-Philadelphia team in CRC history, with a 14–12 win over the University of Texas.[454]\n\n\nPenn men's rugby, as of 2020,[455] is coached by Tiger Bax,[456] a former professional rugby player hailing from Cape Town, South Africa, whose playing experience includes stints in the Super Rugby competition with the Stormers (15s) and Mighty Mohicans (7s), as well as with the Gallagher Premiership Rugby side, Saracens[457] and whose coaching experience includes three successful years as coach at Valley Rugby Football Club in Hong Kong; and Tyler May, from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, who played rugby at Pennsylvania State University where he was a first XV player for three years.\n\n\nPlayers on the 2019 men's team came from 11 countries: Australia, Botswana, Chile, Great Britain, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, China, Taiwan, South Africa, and the United States).\n\n\nPenn's graduate business and law schools also fielded rugby teams. The Wharton rugby team has competed from 1978 to the present.[458] The Penn Law Rugby team (1985 through 1993) counts among its alumni Walter Joseph Jay Clayton, III[459] Penn Law class of 1993, and chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from May 4, 2017, until December 23, 2020, Raymond Hulser, former Chief of Public Integrity Section of United States Department of Justice,[460] and Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart[461] who approved the search of Mar-a-Lago, the residence of former U.S. president Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.[462] Other recent Penn Rugby Alumni include Conor Lamb (Penn College class of 2006 and Penn Law class of 2009), who played for undergraduate team (and had an additional year of eligibility allowing him to continue to playing for undergraduate team while a student at Penn Law per USA Rugby rules), and, as of 2021, is a member of United States House of Representatives, elected originally to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, since 2019 is a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district.\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers football\n\n![](image)Chuck Bednarik, also known as Concrete Charlie was a three-time All-American at Penn who was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, the first player selected in the 1949 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles, where he went on to win the 1960 NFL Championship and was inducted into Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nPenn first fielded a football team against Princeton at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia on November 11, 1876.[431]\n\n\nPenn football made many contributions to the sport in its early days. During the 1890s, Penn's famed coach and alumnus George Washington Woodruff introduced the quarterback kick, a forerunner of the forward pass, as well as the place-kick from scrimmage and the delayed pass. In 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1904, Penn was generally regarded as the national champion of collegiate football.[431] Among the key players on the teams from 1897 to 1900 was Truxton Hare, Sr. who was selected as a charter member of the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951. While primarily a guard, he also ran, punted, kicked off, and drop-kicked extra points.\n\n\nThe achievements of two of Penn's other outstanding players from that era, John Heisman, a Law School alumnus, and John Outland, a Penn Med alumnus, are remembered each year with the presentation of the Heisman Trophy to the most outstanding college football player of the year, and the Outland Trophy to the most outstanding college football interior lineman of the year.\n\n\nAlso, each year the Bednarik Award is given to college football's best defensive player. Chuck Bednarik (class of 1949) was a three-time All-American center/linebacker who starred on the 1947 team and is generally regarded as Penn's all-time finest. In addition to Bednarik, the 1947 squad boasted four-time All-American tackle George Savitsky and three-time All-American halfback Skip Minisi. All three standouts were subsequently elected to the College Football Hall of Fame, as was their coach, George Munger (a star running back at Penn in the early 1930s). Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the Philadelphia Eagles, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1969.\n\n\nPenn's game against University of California at Berkeley on September 29, 1951 (in front of a crowd of 60,000 at Franklin Field), was first college football game to be broadcast in color.[463][464]\nESPN's *College GameDay* traveled to Penn to highlight the Harvard–Penn game on November 17, 2002, the first time the show had visited an Ivy League campus.\n\n\n\n### Ice hockey[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers men's ice hockey\n\n![](image)University of Pennsylvania team in front of photo of College Hall in 1896–97, its first season of existence, featuring George Orton, the future winner of gold medal in the 1900 Summer Olympics 2500 meter steeplechase (top row, second from the end of the right side\nPenn's first ice hockey team competed during the 1896–97 academic year, and joined the nascent Intercollegiate Hockey Association (IHA) in 1898–99. On the first team in 1896–97 were several players of Canadian background, among them middle-distance runner and Olympian George Orton (the first disabled person to compete in the Olympics). Penn fielded teams intermittently until 1965 when it formed a varsity squad that was terminated in 1977. Penn now fields a club team that plays in the American Collegiate Hockey Association Division II,[465] is a member of the Colonial States College Hockey Conference, and continues to play at the Class of 1923 Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[466]\n\n\n\n### Basketball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers men's basketball\n\nPenn basketball is steeped in tradition. Penn made its only (and the Ivy League's second) Final Four appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to Magic Johnson-led Michigan State in Salt Lake City. (Dartmouth twice finished second in the tournament in the 1940s, but that was before the beginning of formal League play.) Penn's team is also a member of the Philadelphia Big 5, along with La Salle, Saint Joseph's, Temple, Villanova, and Drexel. In 2007, the men's team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Texas A&M.

Whitham (seated)\nAt least 43 different Penn alumni have earned 81 Olympic medals (26 gold).[25][note 14] Penn won more of its \"medals\"[25] (which were actually cups, trophies, or plaques, as medals were not introduced until a later Olympics) at 1900 Summer Olympics held in Paris than at any other Olympics.[469] Penn's track and field alumni who won 21 'medals' at the 1900 Paris Olympics are: (1) Alvin Kraenzlein (University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine class of 1900),[470] known as \"the father of the modern hurdling technique\",[471] who was first sportsman in the history of Olympic games to win four individual gold medals in a single discipline;[472][473] (2) Josiah McCracken, MD (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine class of 1901) who won the silver medal in the shot put and a bronze medal for the hammer throw;[474][475][476] (3) John Walter Tewksbury (Penn Dental School class of 1899) who won five 'medals' (gold in the 200 meter dash and 400 meter hurdles, silver in the 60 meter dash and 100 meter dash, and a bronze in the 200 meter hurdles);[477] (4) Irving Baxter (Penn Law class of 1901) who won five medals, including gold in both the men's high jump and men's pole vault and silver in all three of the standing jumps (long, triple, and high);[478][479] (5) Meredith Colket (College Class of 1901 (BS), Penn Law class of 1904) who won the silver 'medal' in the pole vault,[480] (6) Truxton Hare (Penn Law class of 1904) who won the silver 'medal' in the hammer throw[481] (and at 1904 Summer Olympics held in St. Louis, Missouri, won (i) bronze medal in the all-around discipline (which consisted of 100 yard run, shot put, high jump, 880 yard walk, hammer throw, pole vault, 120 yard hurdles, long jump and one mile run), and (ii) gold medal as part of United States tug of war team),[481] and (7) George Orton (University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Arts and Sciences class of 1894 (MA) and class of 1896 (PhD)) who (as first physically disabled Olympic athlete) won a gold 'medal' in the 2,500 meter run and a bronze metal in the 400 meter hurdles[482]\n\n\nThe first African American in the United States to win an Olympic gold medal at an Olympics, the 1908 London Olympics, as part of Medley relay where he ran the third leg, the 400 meters, was John Taylor (University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine (class of 1908)). Taylor was followed by William Hamilton and Nate Cartmell (fellow Penn athlete).[468]\n\n\nIn the 2020 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan, in summer of 2021, nine Penn students and alumni played in six different sports from six different countries.[483]\n\n\n\n### Curling[edit]\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Curling Club qualified for the 2023 National Championship at 6th place, the same ranking they qualified for the 2022 National Championship (where they finished in 2nd place), but in 2023 the team won the national championship by defeating arch rival Princeton University in the championship match (6 to 3).[484][485] Penn Curling also won the National Championship in 2016 and is the only East Coast team to have won the Curling National Championship.[486]\n\n\n\n### Facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn's Franklin Field, in photograph taken shortly after completion of the upper deck in 1925.\nFranklin Field, with a present seating capacity of 52,593,[487] is where the Quakers play football, lacrosse, sprint football and track and field (and formerly played baseball, field hockey, soccer, and rugby). It is the (a) oldest stadium still operating for college football games,[488] (b) first stadium to sport two tiers,[489] (c) first stadium in the country to have a scoreboard, (d) second stadium to have a radio broadcast of football (in 1922 as Pitt versus West Virginia was broadcast in 1921), (e) first stadium from which a commercially televised football game was broadcast (in 1940),[487] and (f) first stadium from which college football game was broadcast in color (on September 29, 1951).[490] Franklin Field also played host to the Philadelphia Eagles from 1958 to 1970 (where installation of artificial turf in 1969 caused it to be first NFL stadium to have such artificial turf),[487] and was the site of 18 Army–Navy games between 1899 and 1935.[491]\n\n\nIt is currently also used by Penn students for recreation such as intramural and club sports, including touch football and cricket. Since 1895, Franklin Field has hosted the annual collegiate track and field event \"the Penn Relays\", which is the oldest and largest track and field competition in the United States.[492]\n\n\nPenn's home court, the Palestra, is an arena used for men's and women's basketball teams, volleyball teams, wrestling team, and Philadelphia Big Five basketball, and other high school sporting events. The Palestra has hosted more NCAA Tournament basketball games than any other facility. Penn staff and students make use of the Palestra to play and/or watch basketball, volleyball, and fencing.\n\n\nPenn's River Fields hosts a number of athletic fields including the Rhodes Soccer Stadium (for both women's and men's soccer, which includes elevated stands for 650 spectators, a 180-degree rotating scoreboard, and the Rapaport Family Suite), the Ellen Vagelos C'90 Field Hockey Field (with special artificial turf), and Irving \"Moon\" Mondschein Throwing Complex (for javelin, shot put, discus, and Hammer throw).[493] In addition, Penn baseball plays its home games at Meiklejohn Stadium at Murphy Field.\n\n\nPenn's Class of 1923 Arena (with seating for up to 3,000 people) was built to host the University of Pennsylvania Varsity Ice Hockey Team, which has been disbanded, and now hosts or in the past hosted: (a) Penn's Men's and Penn Women's club ice hockey teams, (b) practices and/or exhibition games for the Philadelphia Flyers, Colorado Avalanche and Carolina Hurricanes, (c) roller hockey for the Philadelphia Bulldogs professional team, and (d) rock concerts such as one in 1982 featuring Prince.[494][495][496]\n\n\nThe Olympic Boycott Games of 1980 was held at the University of Pennsylvania in response to Moscow's hosting of the 1980 Summer Olympics following the Soviet incursion in Afghanistan. Twenty-nine of the boycotting nations participated in the Boycott Games.\n\n\n\n![](image)Palestra interior in 2016\n![](image)Exterior of the Palestra in April 2007\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Pennsylvania people\n\nSee also: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania\n\n### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Benjamin Franklin, Founding Father; one of the drafters and signers of the Declaration of Independence; 1st Postmaster General](image)\n\nBenjamin Franklin, Founding Father; one of the drafters and signers of the Declaration of Independence; 1st Postmaster General\n* ![Francis Hopkinson, signed the Declaration of Independence and designed the first official American flag.](image)\n\nFrancis Hopkinson, signed the Declaration of Independence and designed the first official American flag.\n* ![George Clymer, Founding Father; early advocate for complete independence from Britain](image)\n\nGeorge Clymer, Founding Father; early advocate for complete independence from Britain\n* ![Benjamin Rush, Founding Father; surgeon general of the Continental Army](image)\n\nBenjamin Rush, Founding Father; surgeon general of the Continental Army\n* ![William Henry Harrison, 9th president of the United States](image)\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison, 9th president of the United States\n* ![Donald Trump, 45th president of the United States](image)\n\nDonald Trump, 45th president of the United States\n* ![Joe Biden, 46th President of the United States, 47th Vice President of the United States, Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor[497]](image)\n\nJoe Biden, 46th President of the United States, 47th Vice President of the United States, Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor[497]\n* ![Martin Luther King, Jr., leader of the civil rights movement, recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.

Cordero, former Pennsylvania senator Arlen Specter, and former Pennsylvania governor and DNC chair Ed Rendell.[510]\n\n\nPenn alumni have also served in several positions in the United States cabinet. Notable alumni include Secretary of Defense Thomas S. Gates; US Attorney Generals Henry Dilworth Gilpin, Caesar Augustus Rodney, and George W. Wickersham; Secretaries of the Treasury Robert John Walker and William M. Meredith; Secretaries of Labor Ann Dore McLaughlin and Frances Perkins  (the longest serving Secretary of Labor and first woman to serve in a Presidential Cabinet); six Secretaries of the Navy; a Surgeon General of the United States, C.

Brown (co-founder of Silicon Graphics) and Mark Pincus (founder of Zynga, the company behind FarmVille).\n\n\nAmong other distinguished alumni are the current or past presidents of over one hundred universities including Harvard University (Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvard's first female president), Cornell University (Martha E. Pollack), Penn (Judith Rodin, first female president in the Ivy League), Princeton University (Harold Dodds), the University of California (Mark Yudof), Carnegie Mellon University (Jared Cohon), and Northwestern University (Morton O. Schapiro).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPenn's alumni also include poets William Augustus Muhlenberg, Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams; civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.; linguist and political theorist Noam Chomsky;[505] architect Louis Kahn; cartoonist Charles Addams; actresses Candice Bergen and Elizabeth Banks; journalist Joe Klein; and fashion designer Tory Burch.\n\n\nPenn alumni have won (a) 53 Tony Awards,[517][518] (b) 17 Grammy Awards,[519] (c) 25 Emmy Awards,[520][521] (d) 13 Academy Awards (and one alumnus[522] who has earned all four awards, known as an EGOT).[note 16] as exemplified by EGOT recipient, recording artist John Legend.[523]\n\n\nWithin the ranks of Penn's graduates, faculty, and/or trustees are also eight signers of the Declaration of Independence[524][525] and seven signers of the United States Constitution[526] and 24 members of the Continental Congress. These historic figures include George Clymer, Francis Hopkinson, Thomas McKean, Robert Morris, William Paca, George Ross, Benjamin Rush, James Wilson, Thomas Fitzsimons, Jared Ingersoll, Rufus King, Thomas Mifflin, Gouverneur Morris and Hugh Williamson.[527][528] Penn alumni include 32 U.S. senators, 163 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 19 U.S. Cabinet Secretaries, 46 governors, and 28 State Supreme Court justices.[529]\n\n\nPenn alumni have also had a significant impact on the United States military as they include Samuel Nicholas, United States Marine Corps founder, and William A. Newell, whose congressional action formed a predecessor to the current United States Coast Guard,[530]: p.1 col.5 – p.2 col.1 and numerous alumni have become generals or similar rank in the United States Armed Forces. At least 2 Penn alumni have been NASA astronauts[531][532] and 5 Penn alumni have been awarded the Medal of Honor.[28][29]\n\n\nAs of 2023, there have been 38 Nobel laureates affiliated (see List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation) with the University of Pennsylvania,[533][505][16] of whom four are current faculty members and eight are alumni.[*citation needed*] Penn also educated members of the United States National Academies and the Academy of Arts and Sciences,[*citation needed*] eight National Medal of Science laureates, numerous Sloan Fellows, several members of the American Philosophical Society, many Guggenheim Fellowships, several Pulitzer Prize winners, four Turing Award winners, and a Fields Medalist[534] [535] [536][537][538]\n\n\n\n### Alumni relations and inter-Ivy events[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to active alumni chapters globally, in 1989, the university bought a 14-story clubhouse building (purpose-built for Yale Club) in New York City from Touro College for $15 million[539] to house Penn's largest alumni chapter. After raising a separate $25 million (including $150,000+ donations each from such alumni as Estee Lauder heirs Leonard Lauder and Ronald Lauder, Saul Steinberg, Michael Milken, Donald Trump, and Ronald Perelman) and two years of renovation,[540] the Penn Club of New York moved to its current location at 30 West 44th Street on NYC's Clubhouse Row[541] across the street from the Harvard Club of New York City, a block west of the Cornell Club of New York, and two blocks west of the Yale Club of New York City. It also is one block north of the (closed due to bank default[542] in 2021) former Princeton Club of New York and joins with those clubs in inter-Ivy events. Although its university is located in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan, the Columbia University Club of New York does not have its own clubhouse and shares the 30 West 44th Street clubhouse with the Penn Club. The New York region of Columbia maintains an office in the Penn Club.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Philadelphia portal\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n\n\n* List of universities by number of billionaire alumni\n* Education in Philadelphia\n* Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program (TTCSP)\n* University of Pennsylvania Press\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** It was not until 1785 that the name was made official as between 1779 and 1785 name was simply \"University\" in Philadelphia see \"Statutes of the Trustees\". University of Pennsylvania. Retrieved September 12, 2022.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The university officially uses 1740 as its founding date and has since 1899. The ideas and intellectual inspiration for the academic institution stem from 1749, with a pamphlet published by Benjamin Franklin (1705/1706–1790). When Franklin's institution was established, it inhabited a schoolhouse built on November 14, 1740, for another school, which never came to practical fruition.[2] Penn archivist Mark Frazier Lloyd noted, \"In 1899, UPenn's Trustees adopted a resolution that established 1740 as the founding date, but good cases may be made for 1749, when Franklin first convened the Trustees, or 1751, when the first classes were taught at the affiliated secondary school for boys, Academy of Philadelphia, or 1755, when Penn obtained its collegiate charter to add a post-secondary institution, the College of Philadelphia.\"[3] Princeton's library presents another diplomatically-phrased view.[4]\n3. **^** See list of University of Pennsylvania people athletics section for list of Penn Olympic medal winners, replete with hyperlinks.\n4. **^**  Penn is the fourth-oldest using the founding dates claimed by each institution. The College of Philadelphia, which became Penn, College of New Jersey, which became Princeton University, and King's College, which later became Columbia College and ultimately Columbia University, all originated within a few years of each other. After initially designating 1750 as its founding date, Penn later considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century with Penn alumni observing a centennial celebration in 1849. In 1895, several elite universities in the United States convened in New York City as the Intercollegiate Commission at the invitation of John J. McCook, a Union Army officer during the American Civil War and member of Princeton's board of trustees who chaired its Committee on Academic Dress. The primary purpose of the conference was to standardize American academic regalia, which was accomplished through the adoption of the Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume. This formalized protocol included a provision that established academic processions and placed visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates. The following year, Penn's *The Alumni Register* magazine, published by the General Alumni Society, began a campaign to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740, to become older than Princeton, which had been chartered in 1746. Three years later in 1899, the university's board of trustees acceded to this alumni initiative and officially changed its founding date from 1749 to 1740, altering its rank in academic processions and offering the informal bragging rights associated with the age-based hierarchy in academia.[36] Princeton implicitly challenges this rationale,[37][38] Further complicating the comparison, a University of Edinburgh-educated Presbyterian minister from Scotland, William Tennent, and his son Gilbert Tennent operated a Log College in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from 1726 until 1746; some have suggested a connection between it and Princeton because five members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were affiliated with it, including Gilbert Tennent, William Tennent, Jr., and Samuel Finley, the latter of whom later became president of Princeton. All 12 members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were leaders from the New Side or New Light wing of the Presbyterian Church in the New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania areas.[39] This antecedent relationship, when considered a formal lineage with institutional continuity, would justify placing Princeton's founding date back to 1726, which would make it earlier than Penn's 1740 founding. However, Princeton has not asserted this, and a Princeton historian says that \"the facts do not warrant\" such an interpretation.[40] Columbia also implicitly challenges Penn's use of either 1750, 1749 or 1740 as its founding date since it claims to be the fifth-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States after Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, and Princeton based on its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755.[41] Academic histories of American higher education typically list Penn variously as either the nation's fifth or sixth-oldest institution of higher learning in the nation after Princeton and immediately before or after Columbia.[42][43][44]\n\nEven Penn's account of its early history agrees that the Academy of Philadelphia did not add the College of Philadelphia until 1755, but university officials continue to make it their practice to assert their fourth-oldest place in academic processions. Other American universities that began in the colonial era, such as St. John's College, which was founded as King William's School in 1696, and the University of Delaware, which was founded as the Free Academy in 1743, choose to utilize the dates they became institutions of higher learning. Penn history professor Edgar Potts Cheyney was a member of the Penn class of 1883 who played a leading role in the 1896–1899 alumni campaign to change the university's formal founding date. According to Cheyney's later recollection, the university considered its founding date to be 1749 for almost a century. However, it was changed with good reason, and primarily due to a publication about the university issued by the U.S. Commissioner of Education written by Francis Newton Thorpe, a fellow alumnus, and colleague in the Penn history department. The year 1740 is the date of the establishment of the university's first educational trust. Cheyney states that \"it might be considered a lawyer's date; it is a familiar legal practice in considering the date of any institution to seek out the oldest trust it administers\". He also points out that Harvard's founding date is also the year in which the Massachusetts General Court, the state legislature of Massachusetts at the time of its founding, resolved to establish a fund in a year's time for a school or college. Princeton claims its founding date is 1746, the date of its first charter. However, the exact words of the charter are unknown, the number and names of the trustees in the charter are unknown, and no known original of the charter is known to exist. Except for Columbia University, the majority of colonial-era colleges and universities do not have clear-cut dates of foundation.[45]\n5. **^** \"...(d) On November 27, 1779, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed an act for the establishment of a University incorporating the rights and powers of the College, Academy, and Charitable School.

Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, it is one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Although originally established to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, the university primarily trained Congregationalist ministers during its early history before it gradually secularized. Emerging into national prominence at the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth was considered to be the most prestigious undergraduate college in the United States in the early 1900s.[8][9] While Dartmouth is now a research university rather than simply an undergraduate college, it continues to go by \"Dartmouth College\" to emphasize its focus on undergraduate education.\n\n\nFollowing a liberal arts curriculum, Dartmouth provides undergraduate instruction in 40 academic departments and interdisciplinary programs, including 60 majors in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering, and enables students to design specialized concentrations or engage in dual degree programs.[10] In addition to the undergraduate faculty of arts and sciences, Dartmouth has four professional and graduate schools: the Geisel School of Medicine, the Thayer School of Engineering, the Tuck School of Business, and the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies.[11] The university also has affiliations with the Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center. Dartmouth is home to the Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Social Sciences, the Hood Museum of Art, the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding, and the Hopkins Center for the Arts. With a student enrollment of about 6,700, Dartmouth is the smallest university in the Ivy League. Undergraduate admissions are highly selective with an acceptance rate of 6% for the class of 2027, including a 4.5% rate for regular decision applicants.[12]\n\n\nSituated on a terrace above the Connecticut River, Dartmouth's 269-acre (109 ha) main campus is in the rural Upper Valley region of New England.[13] The university functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms.[14] Dartmouth is known for its undergraduate focus, Greek culture, and campus traditions.[15][16] Its 34 varsity sports teams compete intercollegiately in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I. The university has many prominent alumni, including 170 members of the United States Congress,[17] 24 U.S. governors, 23 billionaires,[a] 8 U.S. Cabinet secretaries, 3 Nobel Prize laureates, 2 U.S. Supreme Court justices, and a U.S. vice president. Other notable alumni include 81 Rhodes Scholars,[18] 26 Marshall Scholarship recipients,[19] 13 Pulitzer Prize recipients, 10 CEOs of *Fortune* 500 companies,[20] and 51 Olympic medalists.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of presidents of Dartmouth College\n\n![](image)Eleazar Wheelock, Dartmouth College founder\nDartmouth was founded by Eleazar Wheelock, a Yale graduate and Congregational minister from Windham, Connecticut, who had sought to establish a school to train Native Americans as Christian missionaries. It was one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Wheelock's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with Mohegan Indian Samson Occom. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747, and later moved to Long Island to preach to the Montauks.[22]\n\n\nWheelock founded Moor's Indian Charity School in 1755.[23] The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school's operations, and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. The first major donation to the school was given by John Phillips in 1762, who would go on to found Phillips Exeter Academy. Occom, accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money from churches. With these funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock.[22] The head of the trust was a Methodist named William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Charter of Dartmouth College on display in Baker Memorial Library. The charter was signed on December 13, 1769, on behalf of George III.\nAlthough the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock initially had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution, primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. In seeking to expand the school into a college, Wheelock relocated it to Hanover, in the Province of New Hampshire. The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter. The Royal Governor of New Hampshire, John Wentworth, provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13, 1769, issued a royal charter in the name of King George III establishing the college. That charter created a college \"for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing & all parts of Learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences and also of English Youth and any others\". The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable the use of the Charity School's unspent trust funds. Named for William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth – an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock's earlier efforts but who, in fact, opposed creation of the college and never donated to it – Dartmouth is the nation's ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under Colonial rule.[24] The college granted its first degrees in 1771.[8]\n\n\nGiven the limited success of the Charity School, however, Wheelock intended his new college as one primarily for whites.[22][25] Occom, disappointed with Wheelock's departure from the school's original goal of Indian Christianization, went on to form his own community of New England Indians called Brothertown Indians in New York.[22][25]\n\n\n\n![](image)The earliest known image of Dartmouth appeared in the February 1793 issue of *Massachusetts Magazine*. The engraving may also be the first visual proof of cricket being played in the United States.[26]\nIn 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic Dartmouth College case, which challenged New Hampshire's 1816 attempt to amend the college' charter to make the school a public university. An institution called Dartmouth University occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby.[22] Daniel Webster, an alumnus of the class of 1801, presented the college's case to the Supreme Court, which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an illegal impairment of a contract by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the college. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous words: \"It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.\"[22]\n\n\nDartmouth taught its first African-American students in 1775 and 1808. By the end of the Civil War, 20 black men had attended the college or its medical school.[27] and Dartmouth \"was recognized in the African-American community as a place where a man of color could go to get educated\".[28] One of them, Jonathan C. Gibbs, served as Secretary of State and Superintendent of Public Instruction for the state of Florida.\n\n\nIn 1866, the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts was incorporated in Hanover, in connection with Dartmouth College. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth and was directed by Dartmouth's president. The new college was moved to Durham, New Hampshire, in 1891, and later became known as the University of New Hampshire.[29]\n\n\n\nDartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the college had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded.[30] Under President William Jewett Tucker (1893–1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor John Ordronaux.[31] 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold. Tucker is often credited for having \"refounded Dartmouth\" and bringing it into national prestige.[32] \n\n![](image)Lithograph of the President's House, Thornton Hall, Dartmouth Hall, and Wentworth HallPresidents Ernest Fox Nichols (1909–16) and Ernest Martin Hopkins (1916–45) continued Tucker's trend of modernization, further improving campus facilities and introducing selective admissions in the 1920s.[30] In 1945, Hopkins was subject to no small amount of controversy, as he openly admitted to Dartmouth's practice of using racial quotas to deny Jews entry into the university.[33][34] John Sloan Dickey, serving as president from 1945 until 1970, strongly emphasized the liberal arts, particularly public policy and international relations.[30][35] During World War II, Dartmouth was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission.[36]\n\n\nThe Dartmouth workshop, which was held in 1956, is widely considered to be the founding event of artificial intelligence as a field.\n\n\nIn 1970, longtime professor of mathematics and computer science John George Kemeny became president of Dartmouth.[37] Kemeny oversaw several major changes at the college. Dartmouth, which had been a men's institution, began admitting women as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy.[38] At about the same time, the college adopted its \"Dartmouth Plan\" of academic scheduling, permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities.[37] In 1988, Dartmouth's alma mater song's lyrics changed from \"Men of Dartmouth\" to \"Dear old Dartmouth\".[39]\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, the college saw a major academic overhaul under President James O. Freedman and a controversial (and ultimately unsuccessful) 1999 initiative to encourage the school's single-sex Greek houses to go coed.[30][40] The first decade of the 21st century saw the commencement of the $1.5 billion Campaign for the Dartmouth Experience, the largest capital fundraising campaign in the college's history, which surpassed $1 billion in 2008.[41][42] The mid- and late first decade of the 21st century have also seen extensive campus construction, with the erection of two new housing complexes, full renovation of two dormitories, and a forthcoming dining hall, life sciences center, and visual arts center.[43] In 2004, Booz Allen Hamilton selected Dartmouth College as a model of institutional endurance \"whose record of endurance has had implications and benefits for all American organizations, both academic and commercial\", citing *Dartmouth College v. Woodward* and Dartmouth's successful self-reinvention in the late 19th century.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)College seal at the Collis Center\nSince the election of a number of petition-nominated trustees to the Board of Trustees starting in 2004, the role of alumni in Dartmouth governance has been the subject of ongoing conflict.[44] President James Wright announced his retirement in February 2008[45] and was replaced by Harvard University professor and physician Jim Yong Kim on July 1, 2009.[46]\n\n\nIn May 2010 Dartmouth joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Durham University (UK), Queen's University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Tübingen (Germany), University of Western Australia (Australia) and Uppsala University (Sweden).[47]\n\n\nIn early August 2019, Dartmouth College agreed to pay nine current and former students a total of $14 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging they were sexually harassed by three former neuroscience professors.[48]\n\n\nIn 2019, Dartmouth College was elected to the Association of American Universities (AAU).[49]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Dartmouth College returned the papers of Samson Occum (who helped Eleazar Wheelock secure the funds for Dartmouth College for what Occom believed would be a school for Native students in Connecticut) to the Mohegan Tribe.[50][51]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Dartmouth Hall was rededicated after a $42 million renovation. Fundraising for the project was led by over 1700 alumnae as part of the celebration of 50 years of coeducation at Dartmouth College.[52]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baker Memorial Library\nDartmouth, a liberal arts institution, offers a four-year Bachelor of Arts and ABET-accredited Bachelor of Engineering degree to undergraduate students.[53][54] The college has 39 academic departments offering 56 major programs, while students are free to design special majors or engage in dual majors.[55] For the graduating class of 2017, the most popular majors were economics, government, computer science, engineering sciences, and history.[56] The Economics Department, whose prominent professors include David Blanchflower and Andrew Samwick, also holds the distinction as the top-ranked bachelor's-only economics program in the world.[57]\n\n\n\n![](image)A view of East Campus from Baker Tower\nIn order to graduate, a student must complete 35 total courses, eight to ten of which are typically part of a chosen major program.[58] Other requirements for graduation include the completion of ten \"distributive requirements\" in a variety of academic fields, proficiency in a foreign language, and completion of a writing class and first-year seminar in writing.[58] Many departments offer honors programs requiring students seeking that distinction to engage in \"independent, sustained work\", culminating in the production of a thesis.[58] In addition to the courses offered in Hanover, Dartmouth offers 57 different off-campus programs, including Foreign Study Programs, Language Study Abroad programs, and Exchange Programs.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tuck School of Business\nThrough the Graduate Studies program, Dartmouth grants doctorate and master's degrees in 19 Arts & Sciences graduate programs. Although the first graduate degree, a PhD in classics, was awarded in 1885, many of the current PhD programs have only existed since the 1960s.[53] Furthermore, Dartmouth is home to three professional schools: the Geisel School of Medicine (established 1797), Thayer School of Engineering (1867)—which also serves as the undergraduate department of engineering sciences—and Tuck School of Business (1900). With these professional schools and graduate programs, conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of \"Dartmouth University\";[53] however, because of historical and nostalgic reasons (such as *Dartmouth College v. Woodward*), the school uses the name \"Dartmouth College\" to refer to the entire institution.[22]\n\n\nDartmouth employs a total of 607 tenured or tenure-track faculty members, including the highest proportion of female tenured professors among the Ivy League universities,[53] and the first black woman tenure-track faculty member in computer science at an Ivy League university.[61] Faculty members have been at the forefront of such major academic developments as the Dartmouth Workshop, the Dartmouth Time Sharing System, Dartmouth BASIC, and Dartmouth ALGOL 30. In 2005, sponsored project awards to Dartmouth faculty research amounted to $169 million.[62]\n\n\nDartmouth served as the host member of the University Press of New England, a university press founded in 1970 that included Brandeis University, Tufts University, the University of New Hampshire, and Northeastern University. The University Press of New England shut down in 2018.[63][64] With the exception of Dartmouth College Press titles, in 2021, Brandeis become the sole owner of all copyrights and titles of UPNE.[65]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[66] | 16 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[67] | 18 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[68] | 28 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[69] | 13 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[70] | 301–400 |\n| *QS*[71] | 237 |\n| *THE*[72] | 161 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[73] | 261 |\n\n\n\n\n| *USNWR* graduate school rankings[74]\n |\n| --- |\n| Business\n | 6\n |\n| Engineering\n | 55\n |\n| Medicine: Primary Care\n | 46\n |\n| Medicine: Research\n | 48\n |\n\n\n\n\n| *USNWR* departmental rankings[74]\n |\n| --- |\n| Biological Sciences\n | 33\n |\n| Chemistry\n | 67\n |\n| Computer Science\n | 43\n |\n| Earth Sciences\n | 54\n |\n| Mathematics\n | 53\n |\n| Physics\n | 61\n |\n| Psychology\n | 53\n |\n| Public Health\n | 41\n |\n\n\nDartmouth was ranked 12th among undergraduate programs at national universities by *U.S. News & World Report* in its 2022 rankings. *U.S. News* also ranked the school 3rd best for veterans, tied for 5th best in undergraduate teaching, and 7th for \"best value\" national universities.[75] Dartmouth's undergraduate teaching was previously ranked 1st by *U.S. News* for five years in a row (2009–2013).[76] Dartmouth College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[77]\n\n\nIn *Forbes*' 2019 rankings of 650 universities, liberal arts colleges and service academies, Dartmouth ranked 10th overall and 10th in research universities.[78] In the *Forbes* 2018 \"grateful graduate\" rankings, Dartmouth came in first for the second year in a row.[79]\n\n\nThe 2021 *Academic Ranking of World Universities* ranked Dartmouth among the 90–110th best universities in the nation.[80] However, this specific ranking has drawn criticism from scholars for not adequately adjusting for the size of an institution, which leads to larger institutions ranking above smaller ones like Dartmouth.[81]\n\n\nThe 2006 Carnegie Foundation classification listed Dartmouth as the only \"majority-undergraduate\", \"arts-and-sciences focus[ed]\", \"research university\" in the country that also had \"some graduate coexistence\" and \"very high research activity\".[82][83][84]\n\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2022 enteringclass[12][85]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | Overall: 6.24%ED: 21.3%RD: 4.7% |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT EBRW | 710–770 |\n| SAT Math | 730–790 |\n| ACT Composite | 32–35 |\n| High school GPA[i] |\n| Top 10% | 95% |\n| Top 25% | 98.7% |\n| Top 50% | 99.5% |\n| 1. **^** Among students whose school ranked\n |\n\n\nUndergraduate admission to Dartmouth College is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation and *U.S. News & World Report* as \"most selective\".[86][87] The *Princeton Review*, in its 2023 edition, gave the university an admissions selectivity rating of 98 out of 99.[88]\n\n\n\n![](image)McNutt Hall, home to the Dartmouth Office of Undergraduate Admissions\nFor the freshman class entering Fall 2023, Dartmouth received a record 28,841 applications of which 6.2% were accepted, consistent with the prior two years; approximately 67% of those accepted are expected to matriculate. Of those admitted students who reported class rank, 444 were ranked first or second in their class, while 96% ranked in the top decile. The admitted students' academic profile showed an all-time high SAT average score of 1501, while the average composite ACT score remained at 33.[89]\n\n\nAdditionally, for the 2016–2017 academic year, Dartmouth received 685 transfer applications of which 5.1% were accepted, with an average SAT composite score of 1490, average composite ACT score of 34, and average college GPA of about 3.85.[90] Dartmouth meets 100% of students' demonstrated financial need in order to attend the college, and currently admits all students, including internationals, on a need-blind basis.[91]\n\n\n\n### Financial aid[edit]\n\n\nDartmouth guarantees to meet 100% of the demonstrated need of every admitted student who applies for financial aid at the time of admission. Dartmouth is one of seven American universities to practice international need-blind admissions.[92] This means that all applicants, including U.S. permanent residents, undocumented students in the U.S., and international students, are admitted to the college without regard to their financial circumstances. At Dartmouth, free tuition is provided for students from families with total incomes of $125,000 or less and possessing typical assets.[93] Dartmouth is also one of a few U.S. universities to eliminate undergraduate student loans and replace them with expanded scholarship grants.[94] In 2015, $88.8 million (~$112 million in 2023) in need-based scholarships were awarded to Dartmouth students.\n\n\nThe median family income of Dartmouth students is $200,400, with 58% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 14% from the bottom 60%.[95][*needs update*]\n\n\nHowever, a 2022 article from *The Dartmouth* disputes the college's claims by saying the following: \"To put it all together with the $9 million of student debt from the Class of 2021, this change in Dartmouth policy, hailed as \"eliminat[ing] loans for undergraduate students\" actually eliminated only about a quarter—27.4% to be exact—of student loans for undergraduate students. So, while Dartmouth gets glowing coverage in news publications across the country, 72.6% of the debt it saddles its students with remains.\"[96]\n\n\n\n### The Dartmouth Plan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tower Room in Baker Memorial Library\nDartmouth functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms. The Dartmouth Plan (or simply \"D-Plan\") is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student's academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman year and two terms of their senior year, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year.[97] However, students may petition to alter this plan so that they may be off during terms of their senior year or sophomore summer terms.[98] During all terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects.[97] The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for 12 total terms over the course of their academic career.[99]\n\n\nThe D-Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates. It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations, and has been described as \"a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds\".[30] Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect. It was modified in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity.\n\n\n\n### Board of trustees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dartmouth Hall was reconstructed in 1906.\nMain article: Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College\n\nDartmouth is governed by a board of trustees comprising the college president (*ex officio*), the state governor (*ex officio*), 13 trustees nominated and elected by the board (called \"charter trustees\"), and eight trustees nominated by alumni and elected by the board (\"alumni trustees\").[100] The nominees for alumni trustee are determined by a poll of the members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College, selecting from among names put forward by the Alumni Council or by alumni petition.\n\n\nAlthough the board elected its members from the two sources of nominees in equal proportions between 1891 and 2007,[101] the board decided in 2007 to add several new members, all charter trustees.[102] In the controversy that followed the decision, the Association of Alumni filed a lawsuit, although it later withdrew the action.[103][104] In 2008, the board added five new charter trustees.[105]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Dartmouth College buildings\n\n> \n> This is what a college is supposed to look like.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1953[106]\n\n![](image)Drawing of Wilson Hall, Dartmouth's first library building, by architect Samuel J. F. Thayer (1842–1893), which appeared in *American Architect and Building News* in March 1885.\nDartmouth College is situated in the rural town of Hanover, New Hampshire, located in the Upper Valley along the Connecticut River in New England. Its 269-acre (1.09 km2) campus is centered on a 5-acre (2 ha) \"Green\",[107] a former field of pine trees cleared in 1771.[108] Dartmouth is the largest private landowner of the town of Hanover,[109] and its total landholdings and facilities are worth an estimated $434 million.[110] In addition to its campus in Hanover, Dartmouth owns 4,500 acres (18 km2) of Mount Moosilauke in the White Mountains[111] and a 27,000-acre (110 km2) tract of land in northern New Hampshire known as the Second College Grant.[112]\n\n\n\n![](image)American elm on Dartmouth College campus, June 2011\nDartmouth's campus buildings vary in age from Wentworth and Thornton Halls of the 1820s (the oldest surviving buildings constructed by the college) to new dormitories and mathematics facilities completed in 2006.[113][114] Most of Dartmouth's buildings are designed in the Georgian colonial architecture style,[115][116][117] a theme which has been preserved in recent architectural additions.[118] The college has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus, earning it the grade of A− from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2008.[119][120]\n\n\nA notable feature of the Dartmouth campus is its many trees which (despite Dutch elm disease) include some 200 American elms.[121][122] The campus also has the largest Kentucky coffeetree in New Hampshire, at 91 ft tall.[123]\n\n\nWhile Dartmouth's campus is located in a rural setting, it is connected to several major cities by intercity bus services that directly serve Dartmouth and Hanover. Dartmouth Coach provides service from Hanover to South Station and Logan International Airport in Boston as well as New York City, while Greyhound Lines operates a daily route connecting Hanover and Montreal. All three cities are popular weekend/vacation destinations for Dartmouth students.\n\n\n\n### Academic facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Hopkins Center\nThe college's creative and performing arts facility is the Hopkins Center for the Arts (\"the Hop\"). Opened in 1962, the Hop houses the college's drama, music, film, and studio arts departments, as well as a woodshop, pottery studio, and jewelry studio which are open for use by students and faculty.[124] The building was designed by the famed architect Wallace Harrison, who would later design the similar-looking façade of Manhattan's Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center.[125] Its facilities include two theaters and one 900-seat auditorium.[124] The Hop is also the location of all student mailboxes (\"Hinman boxes\")[126] and the Courtyard Café dining facility.[127] The Hop is connected to the Hood Museum of Art, arguably North America's oldest museum in continuous operation,[128] and the Loew Auditorium, where films are screened.[129]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sherman Fairchild Physical Sciences Center\nIn addition to its 19 graduate programs in the arts and sciences, Dartmouth is home to three separate graduate schools. The Geisel School of Medicine is located in a complex on the north side of campus[130] and includes laboratories, classrooms, offices, and a biomedical library.[131] The Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center, located several miles to the south in Lebanon, New Hampshire, contains a 396-bed teaching hospital for the Medical School.[132] The Thayer School of Engineering and the Tuck School of Business are both located at the end of Tuck Mall, west of the center of campus and near the Connecticut River.[131] The Thayer School comprises two buildings;[131] Tuck has seven academic and administrative buildings, as well as several common areas.[133] The two graduate schools share a library, the Feldberg Business & Engineering Library.[133] In December 2018, Dartmouth began a major expansion of the west end of campus by breaking ground on the $200 million (~$239 million in 2023) Center for Engineering and Computer Science.[134] The Center will house the Computer Science department and Magnuson Center for Entrepreneurship. In October 2019, construction began on the Irving Institute of Energy and Society.[135] Both were completed by Spring 2022, and the Center for Engineering and Computer Science was renamed the Class of 1982 Engineering and Computer Science Center.[136]\n\n\nDartmouth's libraries are all part of the collective Dartmouth College Library, which comprises 2.48 million volumes and 6 million total resources, including videos, maps, sound recordings, and photographs.[53][137] Its specialized libraries include the Biomedical Libraries, Evans Map Room, Feldberg Business & Engineering Library, Jones Media Center, Rauner Special Collections Library, and Sherman Art Library. Baker-Berry Library is the main library at Dartmouth, consisting of a merger of the Baker Memorial Library (opened 1928) and the Berry Library (completed 2002).[138] Located on the northern side of the Green, Baker's 200-foot (61 m) tower is an iconic symbol of the college.[139][140][141]\n\n\n\n### Athletic facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Field\nDartmouth's original sports field was the Green, where students played cricket and old division football during the 19th century.[108] Today, two of Dartmouth's athletic facilities are located in the southeast corner of campus.[142] The center of athletic life is the Alumni Gymnasium, which includes the Karl Michael Competition Pool and the Spaulding Pool, a fitness center, a weight room, and a 1/13th-mile (123 m) indoor track.[143] Attached to Alumni Gymnasium is the Berry Sports Center, which contains basketball and volleyball courts (Leede Arena), as well as the Kresge Fitness Center.[144] Behind the Alumni Gymnasium is Memorial Field, a 15,600-seat stadium overlooking Dartmouth's football field and track.[145] The nearby Thompson Arena, designed by Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi and constructed in 1975, houses Dartmouth's ice rink.[146] Also visible from Memorial Field is the 91,800-square-foot (8,530 m2) Nathaniel Leverone Fieldhouse, home to the indoor track. The new softball field, Dartmouth Softball Park, was constructed in 2012, sharing parking facilities with Thompson arena and replacing Sachem Field, located over a mile from campus, as the primary softball facility.\n\n\nDartmouth's other athletic facilities in Hanover include the Friends of Dartmouth Rowing Boathouse and the old rowing house storage facility (both located along the Connecticut River), the Hanover Country Club, Dartmouth's oldest remaining athletic facility (established in 1899),[147] and the Corey Ford Rugby Clubhouse.[148] The college also maintains the Dartmouth Skiway, a 100-acre (0.40 km2) skiing facility located over two mountains near the Hanover campus in Lyme Center, New Hampshire,[149] that serves as the winter practice grounds for the Dartmouth ski team, which is a perennial contender for the NCAA Division I championship.\n\n\nDartmouth's close association and involvement in the development of the downhill skiing industry is featured in the 2010 book *Passion for Skiing* as well as the 2013 documentary based on the book *Passion for Snow*.[150]\n\n\n\n### Residential housing and student life facilities[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in the fall term of 2016, Dartmouth placed all undergraduate students in one of six House communities, similar to residential colleges, including Allen House, East Wheelock House, North Park House, School House, South House, and West House, alongside independent Living Learning Communities.[151] Dartmouth used to have nine residential communities located throughout campus, instead of ungrouped dormitories or residential colleges.[152] The dormitories varied in design from modern to traditional Georgian styles, and room arrangements range from singles to quads and apartment suites.[152] Since 2006, the college has guaranteed housing for students during their freshman and sophomore years.[153] More than 3,000 students elect to live in housing provided by college.[152]\n\n\nCampus meals are served by Dartmouth Dining Services, which operates 11 dining establishments around campus.[154] The Class of 1953 Commons, commonly referred to as \"Foco\", is the all-you-can-eat dining hall, located at the center of campus. Dartmouth also operates à la carte cafes around campus (Collis Café, Courtyard Café, Novack Café, The Fern Coffee & Tea Bar, Ramekin, and Café@Baker), a convenience store (Collis Market), and 3 snack bars located in the Allen House Commons (also called the \"Cube\"), McLaughlin Cluster, and East Wheelock Cluster.[155]\n\n\nThe Collis Center is the center of student life and programming, serving as what would be generically termed the \"student union\" or \"campus center\".[156] It contains a café, study space, common areas, and a number of administrative departments, including the Academic Skills Center.[157][158] Robinson Hall, next door to both the Collis Center and the Class of 1953 Commons, contains the offices of a number of student organizations, including the Dartmouth Outing Club and *The Dartmouth* daily newspaper.[159]\n\n\n\n#### House communities[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Founded\n | Total capacity\n | Main location capacity\n | Main location buildings[160] | Freshman buildings[161] | Color\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Allen House\n | 2016\n | 426\n | 257\n | Gile Hall, Streeter Hall, Lord Hall\n | Bissell Hall, Cohen Hall\n | Red\n |\n| East Wheelock House\n | 2016\n | 327\n | 327\n | Andres Hall, Zimmerman Hall, Morton Hall, McCulloch Hall\n |  | Orange\n |\n| North Park House\n | 2016\n | 214\n | 137\n | Thomas Hall, Goldstein Hall, Byrne II Hall, Rauner Hall, Bildner Hall, Berry Hall\n |  | Dark Blue\n |\n| School House\n | 2016\n | 561\n | 333\n | North, Mid- and South Massachusetts Halls, Hitchcock Hall\n | Brown Hall, Little Hall, Wheeler Hall\n | Light Blue\n |\n| South House\n | 2016\n | 592\n | 366\n | Topliff Hall, New Hampshire Hall, The Lodge\n | North, Mid- and South Fayerweather Halls, Richardson Hall\n | Black\n |\n| West House\n | 2016\n | 520\n | 335\n | Russell Sage Hall, Butterfield Hall, Fahey Hall, McLane Hall\n | French Hall, Judge Hall\n | Purple\n |\n\n\n* ![Lord Hall, Allen House](image)\n\nLord Hall, Allen House\n* ![Morton Hall, East Wheelock House](image)\n\nMorton Hall, East Wheelock House\n* ![Woodward Hall, North Park House](image)\n\nWoodward Hall, North Park House\n* ![Mid Massachusetts Hall, School House](image)\n\nMid Massachusetts Hall, School House\n* ![Topliff Hall, South House](image)\n\nTopliff Hall, South House\n* ![Russell Sage Hall, West House](image)\n\nRussell Sage Hall, West House\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[162] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 49%\n | 49 |\n| Asian | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Foreign national | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Hispanic | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Other[b] | 8%\n | 8 |\n| Black | 6%\n | 6 |\n| Native American | 1%\n | 1 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[c] | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Affluent[d] | 85%\n | 85 |\n\n\nDartmouth's Student Government represents students on issues related to student life.[163][164] [165] Annually, students elect a student body president, vice president, and undergraduate senate to represent them in the following academic year. In 2006, *The Princeton Review* ranked Dartmouth third in its \"Quality of Life\" category, and sixth for having the \"Happiest Students\".[166] Athletics and participation in the Greek system are the most popular campus activities.[167] In all, Dartmouth offers more than 350 organizations, teams, and sports.[168] The school is also home to a variety of longstanding traditions and celebrations and has a loyal alumni network; Dartmouth ranked #2 in \"The Princeton Review\" in 2006 for Best Alumni Network.[169]\n\n\nIn 2014, Dartmouth College was the third highest in the nation in \"total of reports of rape\" on their main campus, with 42 reports of rape.[170] The *Washington Post* attributed the high number of rape reports to the fact that a growing number of sexual assault victims feel comfortable enough to report sexual assaults that would have gone unreported in previous years.[170] In 2015, the Huffington Post reported that Dartmouth had the highest rate of bystander intervention of any college surveyed, with 57.7% of Dartmouth students reporting that they would take some sort of action if they saw someone acting in a \"sexually violent or harassing manner,\" compared to 45.5% of students nationally.[171]\n\n\nDartmouth fraternities have an extensive history of hazing and alcohol abuse, leading to police raids and accusations of sexual harassment.[172][173]\n\n\n\n### Student groups[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Dartmouth College student groups, Dartmouth College publications, and Dartmouth College Greek organizations\n\n![](image)Robinson Hall houses many of the College's student-run organizations, including the Dartmouth Outing Club. The building is a designated stop along the Appalachian Trail.\n![](image)Dartmouth Alpha Chi Alpha fraternity house\nDartmouth's more than 200 student organizations and clubs cover a wide range of interests.[174] In 2007, the college hosted eight academic groups, 17 cultural groups, two honor societies, 30 \"issue-oriented\" groups, 25 performing groups, 12 pre-professional groups, 20 publications, and 11 recreational groups.[175] Notable student groups include the nation's largest and oldest collegiate outdoors club, the Dartmouth Outing Club,[176] which includes the nationally recognized[177] Big Green Bus; the campus's oldest a cappella group, The Dartmouth Aires; the controversial independent newspaper *The Dartmouth Review*;[178] Dartmouth Student Government, the college's official undergraduate student government;,[164][165] and *The Dartmouth*, arguably the nation's oldest university newspaper.[179] *The Dartmouth* describes itself as \"America's Oldest College Newspaper, Founded 1799\".[179]\n\n\nPartially because of Dartmouth's rural, isolated location, the Greek system dating from the 1840s is one of the most popular social outlets for students.[167][180] Dartmouth is home to 32 recognized Greek houses: 17 fraternities, 12 sororities, and three coeducational organizations.[181] In 2007, roughly 70% of eligible students belonged to a Greek organization;[182] since 1987, students have not been permitted to join Greek organizations until their sophomore year.[183] Dartmouth College was among the first institutions of higher education to desegregate fraternity houses, doing so in the 1950s, and was involved in the movement to create coeducational Greek houses in the 1970s.[184] In the early first decade of the 21st century, campus-wide debate focused on a board of trustees recommendation that Greek organizations become \"substantially coeducational\";[185] this attempt to change the Greek system eventually failed.[186]\n\n\nDartmouth also has a number of secret societies, which are student- and alumni-led organizations often focused on preserving the history of the college and initiating service projects. Most prominent among them is the Sphinx society, housed in a prominent Egyptian tomb-like building near the center of campus. The Sphinx has been the subject of numerous rumors as to its facilities, practices, and membership.[187]\n\n\nThe college has an additional classification of social/residential organizations known as undergraduate societies.[188]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dartmouth Big Green\n\n![](image)A Dartmouth varsity hockey game against Princeton at Thompson Arena\nApproximately 20% of students participate in a varsity sport, and nearly 80% participate in some form of club, varsity, intramural, or other athletics.[189] In 2021, Dartmouth College fielded 33 intercollegiate varsity teams: 15 for men, 17 for women, and coeducational sailing and equestrian programs.[190] Dartmouth's athletic teams compete in the NCAA Division I eight-member Ivy League conference; some teams also participate in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC).[191] As is mandatory for the members of the Ivy League, Dartmouth College does not offer athletic scholarships.[191][192] In addition to the traditional American team sports (football, basketball, baseball, and ice hockey), Dartmouth competes at the varsity level in many other sports including track and field, softball, squash, sailing, tennis, rowing, soccer, skiing, and lacrosse.[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe college also offers 26 club and intramural sports such as fencing, rugby, water polo, figure skating, boxing, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and cricket, leading to a 75% participation rate in athletics among the undergraduate student body.[53][193] The Dartmouth Fencing Team, despite being entirely self-coached, won the USACFC club national championship in 2014.[194] The Dartmouth Men's Rugby Team, founded in 1951, has been ranked among the best collegiate teams in that sport, winning for example the Ivy Rugby Conference every year between 2008 and 2020.[195] The figure skating team won the national championship five straight times from 2004 through 2008.[196] In addition to the academic requirements for graduation, Dartmouth requires every undergraduate to complete a 50-yard (46 m) swim and three terms of physical education.[197]\n\n\n\n### Native Americans at Dartmouth[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 40th Dartmouth Powwow\nThe charter of Dartmouth College, granted to Wheelock in 1769, proclaims that the institution was created \"for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing and all parts of Learning ... as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth and any others\".[198] However, Wheelock primarily intended the college to educate white youth, and the few Native students that attended Dartmouth experienced much difficulty in an institution ostensibly dedicated to their education. The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Mohegan named Samson Occom, and at least some of those funds were used to help found the college.[199]\n\n\nThe college graduated only 19 Native Americans during its first 200 years.[199] In 1970, the college established Native American academic and social programs as part of a \"new dedication to increasing Native American enrollment\".[199] Since then, Dartmouth has graduated over 700 Native American students from over 200 different tribes, more than the other seven Ivy League universities combined.[199]\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dartmouth College traditions\n\nDartmouth is well known for its fierce school spirit and many traditions.[200] The college functions on a quarter system, and one weekend each term is set aside as a traditional celebratory event, known on campus as \"big weekends\"[201][202] or \"party weekends\".[203] In the fall term, Homecoming (officially called Dartmouth Night) is marked by a bonfire on the Green constructed by the freshman class.[204] Winter term is celebrated by Winter Carnival, a tradition started in 1911 by the Dartmouth Outing Club to promote winter sports. This tradition is the oldest in the United States, and subsequently went on to catch on at other New England colleges.[205][206] In the spring, Green Key is a weekend mostly devoted to campus parties and celebration.[207]\n\n\nThe summer term was formerly marked by Tubestock, an unofficial tradition in which the students used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the Connecticut River. Begun in 1986, Tubestock was ended in 2006 by town ordinance.[208] The Class of 2008, during their summer term on campus in 2006, replaced the defunct Tubestock with Fieldstock. This new celebration includes a barbecue, live music, and the revival of the 1970s and 1980s tradition of racing homemade chariots around the Green. Unlike Tubestock, Fieldstock is funded and supported by the college.[209]\n\n\nAnother longstanding tradition is four-day, student-run First-Year Trips for incoming freshmen, begun in 1935. Each trip concludes at the Moosilauke Ravine Lodge.[210] In 2011, over 96% of freshmen elected to participate.\n\n\n\n## Insignia and other representations[edit]\n\n\n### Motto and song[edit]\n\n\nDartmouth's motto, chosen by Eleazar Wheelock, is *Vox clamantis in deserto*. The Latin motto is literally translated as \"The voice of one crying in the wilderness\",[211][212] but is more often rendered as \"A voice crying out in the wilderness\".[1] The phrase appears five times in the Bible and is a reference to the college's location on what was once the frontier of European settlement.[212][213] Richard Hovey's \"Men of Dartmouth\" was elected as the best of Dartmouth's songs in 1896,[204] and became the school's official song in 1926.[214] The song was retitled to \"Alma Mater\" in the 1980s when its lyrics were changed to refer to women as well as men.[215]\n\n\n\n### Seal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seal of Dartmouth College\n\n![](image)Seal of Dartmouth College\nDartmouth's 1769 royal charter required the creation of a seal for use on official documents and diplomas.[198] The college's founder, Eleazar Wheelock, designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education.[212] Engraved by a Boston silversmith, the seal was ready by commencement of 1773. The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25, 1773, describing it as:\n\n\n\n\n> An Oval, circumscribed by a Line containing SIGILL: COL: DARTMUTH: NOV: HANT: IN AMERICA 1770. within projecting a Pine Grove on the Right, whence proceed Natives towards an Edifice two Storey on the left; which bears in a Label over the Grove these Words \"vox clamantis in deserto\" the whole supported by Religion on the Right and Justice on the Left, and bearing in a Triangle irradiate, with the Hebrew Words [El Shaddai], agreeable to the above Impression, be the common Seal under which to pass all Diplomas or Certificates of Degrees, and all other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College.[216]\n> \n> \n\n\nOn October 28, 1926, the trustees affirmed the charter's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone.[212] The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer William Addison Dwiggins to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from \"1770\" to \"1769\", to accord with the date of the college charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of \"1769\" to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use.[212] The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.[217]\n\n\n\n### Shield[edit]\n\n\nOn October 28, 1926, the trustees approved a \"Dartmouth College Shield\" for general use. Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On June 9, 1944, the trustees approved another coat of arms based on the shield part of the seal, this one by Canadian artist and designer Thoreau MacDonald. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins' seal, had its date changed from \"1770\" to \"1769\" around 1958.[212] That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.[217]\n\n\nCollege designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald's design.[218] The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of the Geisel School of Medicine, and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 micrometers across.[219] The design has appeared on Rudolph Ruzicka's Bicentennial Medal (Philadelphia Mint, 1969) and elsewhere.\n\n\n\n### Nickname, symbol, and mascot[edit]\n\n\nDartmouth has never had an official mascot.[220] The nickname \"The Big Green\",[221] originating in the 1860s, is based on students' adoption of a shade of forest green (\"Dartmouth Green\") as the school's official color in 1866.[222][223] Beginning in the 1920s, the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname \"the Indians\", a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists.[220] This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s, when its use came under criticism. In 1974, the Trustees declared the \"use of the [Indian] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education\".[224] Some alumni and students, as well as the conservative student newspaper, *The Dartmouth Review*, have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence,[225] but never succeeded in doing so.[226]\n\n\nVarious student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a mascot, but none has become \"official\". One proposal devised by the college humor magazine the *Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern* was Keggy the Keg, an anthropomorphic beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events. Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy,[227] the mascot has received approval from only the student government.[228] In November 2006, student government attempted to revive the \"Dartmoose\" as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former unofficial Indian mascot.[229]\n\n\n\n## Alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Dartmouth College alumni\n\nDartmouth's alumni are known for frequently donating to their alma mater.[230] Most start by giving to the Senior Class Gift. According to a 2008 article in *The Wall Street Journal* based on data from payscale.com, Dartmouth graduates also earn higher median salaries at least 10 years after graduation than alumni of any other American university surveyed.[231]\n\n\nBy 2008, Dartmouth had graduated 238 classes of students, and had over 60,000 living alumni in a variety of fields.[232] Finance, consulting, and technology have consistently been the most popular industries to enter for students.[233] Top employers of new graduates include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, McKinsey & Company, Bain & Company, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.\n\n\nNelson A.

Whereas in the case of the other rankings the results are adjusted to take account of the size of institutions, hardly any such adjustment is made by ARWU. So there is a distortion in favor of large institutions. If two institutions were to merge, the very fact of merger would mean that the merged institution would do nearly twice as well as either of the individual institutions prior to merger, although nothing else had changed.\n82. **^** \"Carnegie Classifications | Institution Profile\".

Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, it is one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Although originally established to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, the university primarily trained Congregationalist ministers during its early history before it gradually secularized. Emerging into national prominence at the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth was considered to be the most prestigious undergraduate college in the United States in the early 1900s.[8][9] While Dartmouth is now a research university rather than simply an undergraduate college, it continues to go by \"Dartmouth College\" to emphasize its focus on undergraduate education.\n\n\nFollowing a liberal arts curriculum, Dartmouth provides undergraduate instruction in 40 academic departments and interdisciplinary programs, including 60 majors in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering, and enables students to design specialized concentrations or engage in dual degree programs.[10] In addition to the undergraduate faculty of arts and sciences, Dartmouth has four professional and graduate schools: the Geisel School of Medicine, the Thayer School of Engineering, the Tuck School of Business, and the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies.[11] The university also has affiliations with the Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center. Dartmouth is home to the Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Social Sciences, the Hood Museum of Art, the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding, and the Hopkins Center for the Arts. With a student enrollment of about 6,700, Dartmouth is the smallest university in the Ivy League. Undergraduate admissions are highly selective with an acceptance rate of 6% for the class of 2027, including a 4.5% rate for regular decision applicants.[12]\n\n\nSituated on a terrace above the Connecticut River, Dartmouth's 269-acre (109 ha) main campus is in the rural Upper Valley region of New England.[13] The university functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms.[14] Dartmouth is known for its undergraduate focus, Greek culture, and campus traditions.[15][16] Its 34 varsity sports teams compete intercollegiately in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I. The university has many prominent alumni, including 170 members of the United States Congress,[17] 24 U.S. governors, 23 billionaires,[a] 8 U.S. Cabinet secretaries, 3 Nobel Prize laureates, 2 U.S. Supreme Court justices, and a U.S. vice president. Other notable alumni include 81 Rhodes Scholars,[18] 26 Marshall Scholarship recipients,[19] 13 Pulitzer Prize recipients, 10 CEOs of *Fortune* 500 companies,[20] and 51 Olympic medalists.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of presidents of Dartmouth College\n\n![](image)Eleazar Wheelock, Dartmouth College founder\nDartmouth was founded by Eleazar Wheelock, a Yale graduate and Congregational minister from Windham, Connecticut, who had sought to establish a school to train Native Americans as Christian missionaries. It was one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Wheelock's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with Mohegan Indian Samson Occom. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747, and later moved to Long Island to preach to the Montauks.[22]\n\n\nWheelock founded Moor's Indian Charity School in 1755.[23] The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school's operations, and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. The first major donation to the school was given by John Phillips in 1762, who would go on to found Phillips Exeter Academy. Occom, accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money from churches. With these funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock.[22] The head of the trust was a Methodist named William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Charter of Dartmouth College on display in Baker Memorial Library. The charter was signed on December 13, 1769, on behalf of George III.\nAlthough the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock initially had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution, primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. In seeking to expand the school into a college, Wheelock relocated it to Hanover, in the Province of New Hampshire. The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter. The Royal Governor of New Hampshire, John Wentworth, provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13, 1769, issued a royal charter in the name of King George III establishing the college. That charter created a college \"for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing & all parts of Learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences and also of English Youth and any others\". The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable the use of the Charity School's unspent trust funds. Named for William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth – an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock's earlier efforts but who, in fact, opposed creation of the college and never donated to it – Dartmouth is the nation's ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under Colonial rule.[24] The college granted its first degrees in 1771.[8]\n\n\nGiven the limited success of the Charity School, however, Wheelock intended his new college as one primarily for whites.[22][25] Occom, disappointed with Wheelock's departure from the school's original goal of Indian Christianization, went on to form his own community of New England Indians called Brothertown Indians in New York.[22][25]\n\n\n\n![](image)The earliest known image of Dartmouth appeared in the February 1793 issue of *Massachusetts Magazine*. The engraving may also be the first visual proof of cricket being played in the United States.[26]\nIn 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic Dartmouth College case, which challenged New Hampshire's 1816 attempt to amend the college' charter to make the school a public university. An institution called Dartmouth University occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby.[22] Daniel Webster, an alumnus of the class of 1801, presented the college's case to the Supreme Court, which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an illegal impairment of a contract by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the college. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous words: \"It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.\"[22]\n\n\nDartmouth taught its first African-American students in 1775 and 1808. By the end of the Civil War, 20 black men had attended the college or its medical school.[27] and Dartmouth \"was recognized in the African-American community as a place where a man of color could go to get educated\".[28] One of them, Jonathan C. Gibbs, served as Secretary of State and Superintendent of Public Instruction for the state of Florida.\n\n\nIn 1866, the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts was incorporated in Hanover, in connection with Dartmouth College. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth and was directed by Dartmouth's president. The new college was moved to Durham, New Hampshire, in 1891, and later became known as the University of New Hampshire.[29]\n\n\n\nDartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the college had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded.[30] Under President William Jewett Tucker (1893–1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor John Ordronaux.[31] 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold. Tucker is often credited for having \"refounded Dartmouth\" and bringing it into national prestige.[32] \n\n![](image)Lithograph of the President's House, Thornton Hall, Dartmouth Hall, and Wentworth HallPresidents Ernest Fox Nichols (1909–16) and Ernest Martin Hopkins (1916–45) continued Tucker's trend of modernization, further improving campus facilities and introducing selective admissions in the 1920s.[30] In 1945, Hopkins was subject to no small amount of controversy, as he openly admitted to Dartmouth's practice of using racial quotas to deny Jews entry into the university.[33][34] John Sloan Dickey, serving as president from 1945 until 1970, strongly emphasized the liberal arts, particularly public policy and international relations.[30][35] During World War II, Dartmouth was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission.[36]\n\n\nThe Dartmouth workshop, which was held in 1956, is widely considered to be the founding event of artificial intelligence as a field.\n\n\nIn 1970, longtime professor of mathematics and computer science John George Kemeny became president of Dartmouth.[37] Kemeny oversaw several major changes at the college. Dartmouth, which had been a men's institution, began admitting women as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy.[38] At about the same time, the college adopted its \"Dartmouth Plan\" of academic scheduling, permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities.[37] In 1988, Dartmouth's alma mater song's lyrics changed from \"Men of Dartmouth\" to \"Dear old Dartmouth\".[39]\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, the college saw a major academic overhaul under President James O. Freedman and a controversial (and ultimately unsuccessful) 1999 initiative to encourage the school's single-sex Greek houses to go coed.[30][40] The first decade of the 21st century saw the commencement of the $1.5 billion Campaign for the Dartmouth Experience, the largest capital fundraising campaign in the college's history, which surpassed $1 billion in 2008.[41][42] The mid- and late first decade of the 21st century have also seen extensive campus construction, with the erection of two new housing complexes, full renovation of two dormitories, and a forthcoming dining hall, life sciences center, and visual arts center.[43] In 2004, Booz Allen Hamilton selected Dartmouth College as a model of institutional endurance \"whose record of endurance has had implications and benefits for all American organizations, both academic and commercial\", citing *Dartmouth College v. Woodward* and Dartmouth's successful self-reinvention in the late 19th century.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)College seal at the Collis Center\nSince the election of a number of petition-nominated trustees to the Board of Trustees starting in 2004, the role of alumni in Dartmouth governance has been the subject of ongoing conflict.[44] President James Wright announced his retirement in February 2008[45] and was replaced by Harvard University professor and physician Jim Yong Kim on July 1, 2009.[46]\n\n\nIn May 2010 Dartmouth joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Durham University (UK), Queen's University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Tübingen (Germany), University of Western Australia (Australia) and Uppsala University (Sweden).[47]\n\n\nIn early August 2019, Dartmouth College agreed to pay nine current and former students a total of $14 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging they were sexually harassed by three former neuroscience professors.[48]\n\n\nIn 2019, Dartmouth College was elected to the Association of American Universities (AAU).[49]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Dartmouth College returned the papers of Samson Occum (who helped Eleazar Wheelock secure the funds for Dartmouth College for what Occom believed would be a school for Native students in Connecticut) to the Mohegan Tribe.[50][51]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Dartmouth Hall was rededicated after a $42 million renovation. Fundraising for the project was led by over 1700 alumnae as part of the celebration of 50 years of coeducation at Dartmouth College.[52]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baker Memorial Library\nDartmouth, a liberal arts institution, offers a four-year Bachelor of Arts and ABET-accredited Bachelor of Engineering degree to undergraduate students.[53][54] The college has 39 academic departments offering 56 major programs, while students are free to design special majors or engage in dual majors.[55] For the graduating class of 2017, the most popular majors were economics, government, computer science, engineering sciences, and history.[56] The Economics Department, whose prominent professors include David Blanchflower and Andrew Samwick, also holds the distinction as the top-ranked bachelor's-only economics program in the world.[57]\n\n\n\n![](image)A view of East Campus from Baker Tower\nIn order to graduate, a student must complete 35 total courses, eight to ten of which are typically part of a chosen major program.[58] Other requirements for graduation include the completion of ten \"distributive requirements\" in a variety of academic fields, proficiency in a foreign language, and completion of a writing class and first-year seminar in writing.[58] Many departments offer honors programs requiring students seeking that distinction to engage in \"independent, sustained work\", culminating in the production of a thesis.[58] In addition to the courses offered in Hanover, Dartmouth offers 57 different off-campus programs, including Foreign Study Programs, Language Study Abroad programs, and Exchange Programs.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tuck School of Business\nThrough the Graduate Studies program, Dartmouth grants doctorate and master's degrees in 19 Arts & Sciences graduate programs. Although the first graduate degree, a PhD in classics, was awarded in 1885, many of the current PhD programs have only existed since the 1960s.[53] Furthermore, Dartmouth is home to three professional schools: the Geisel School of Medicine (established 1797), Thayer School of Engineering (1867)—which also serves as the undergraduate department of engineering sciences—and Tuck School of Business (1900). With these professional schools and graduate programs, conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of \"Dartmouth University\";[53] however, because of historical and nostalgic reasons (such as *Dartmouth College v. Woodward*), the school uses the name \"Dartmouth College\" to refer to the entire institution.[22]\n\n\nDartmouth employs a total of 607 tenured or tenure-track faculty members, including the highest proportion of female tenured professors among the Ivy League universities,[53] and the first black woman tenure-track faculty member in computer science at an Ivy League university.[61] Faculty members have been at the forefront of such major academic developments as the Dartmouth Workshop, the Dartmouth Time Sharing System, Dartmouth BASIC, and Dartmouth ALGOL 30. In 2005, sponsored project awards to Dartmouth faculty research amounted to $169 million.[62]\n\n\nDartmouth served as the host member of the University Press of New England, a university press founded in 1970 that included Brandeis University, Tufts University, the University of New Hampshire, and Northeastern University. The University Press of New England shut down in 2018.[63][64] With the exception of Dartmouth College Press titles, in 2021, Brandeis become the sole owner of all copyrights and titles of UPNE.[65]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[66] | 16 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[67] | 18 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[68] | 28 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[69] | 13 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[70] | 301–400 |\n| *QS*[71] | 237 |\n| *THE*[72] | 161 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[73] | 261 |\n\n\n\n\n| *USNWR* graduate school rankings[74]\n |\n| --- |\n| Business\n | 6\n |\n| Engineering\n | 55\n |\n| Medicine: Primary Care\n | 46\n |\n| Medicine: Research\n | 48\n |\n\n\n\n\n| *USNWR* departmental rankings[74]\n |\n| --- |\n| Biological Sciences\n | 33\n |\n| Chemistry\n | 67\n |\n| Computer Science\n | 43\n |\n| Earth Sciences\n | 54\n |\n| Mathematics\n | 53\n |\n| Physics\n | 61\n |\n| Psychology\n | 53\n |\n| Public Health\n | 41\n |\n\n\nDartmouth was ranked 12th among undergraduate programs at national universities by *U.S. News & World Report* in its 2022 rankings. *U.S. News* also ranked the school 3rd best for veterans, tied for 5th best in undergraduate teaching, and 7th for \"best value\" national universities.[75] Dartmouth's undergraduate teaching was previously ranked 1st by *U.S. News* for five years in a row (2009–2013).[76] Dartmouth College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[77]\n\n\nIn *Forbes*' 2019 rankings of 650 universities, liberal arts colleges and service academies, Dartmouth ranked 10th overall and 10th in research universities.[78] In the *Forbes* 2018 \"grateful graduate\" rankings, Dartmouth came in first for the second year in a row.[79]\n\n\nThe 2021 *Academic Ranking of World Universities* ranked Dartmouth among the 90–110th best universities in the nation.[80] However, this specific ranking has drawn criticism from scholars for not adequately adjusting for the size of an institution, which leads to larger institutions ranking above smaller ones like Dartmouth.[81]\n\n\nThe 2006 Carnegie Foundation classification listed Dartmouth as the only \"majority-undergraduate\", \"arts-and-sciences focus[ed]\", \"research university\" in the country that also had \"some graduate coexistence\" and \"very high research activity\".[82][83][84]\n\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2022 enteringclass[12][85]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | Overall: 6.24%ED: 21.3%RD: 4.7% |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT EBRW | 710–770 |\n| SAT Math | 730–790 |\n| ACT Composite | 32–35 |\n| High school GPA[i] |\n| Top 10% | 95% |\n| Top 25% | 98.7% |\n| Top 50% | 99.5% |\n| 1. **^** Among students whose school ranked\n |\n\n\nUndergraduate admission to Dartmouth College is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation and *U.S. News & World Report* as \"most selective\".[86][87] The *Princeton Review*, in its 2023 edition, gave the university an admissions selectivity rating of 98 out of 99.[88]\n\n\n\n![](image)McNutt Hall, home to the Dartmouth Office of Undergraduate Admissions\nFor the freshman class entering Fall 2023, Dartmouth received a record 28,841 applications of which 6.2% were accepted, consistent with the prior two years; approximately 67% of those accepted are expected to matriculate. Of those admitted students who reported class rank, 444 were ranked first or second in their class, while 96% ranked in the top decile. The admitted students' academic profile showed an all-time high SAT average score of 1501, while the average composite ACT score remained at 33.[89]\n\n\nAdditionally, for the 2016–2017 academic year, Dartmouth received 685 transfer applications of which 5.1% were accepted, with an average SAT composite score of 1490, average composite ACT score of 34, and average college GPA of about 3.85.[90] Dartmouth meets 100% of students' demonstrated financial need in order to attend the college, and currently admits all students, including internationals, on a need-blind basis.[91]\n\n\n\n### Financial aid[edit]\n\n\nDartmouth guarantees to meet 100% of the demonstrated need of every admitted student who applies for financial aid at the time of admission. Dartmouth is one of seven American universities to practice international need-blind admissions.[92] This means that all applicants, including U.S. permanent residents, undocumented students in the U.S., and international students, are admitted to the college without regard to their financial circumstances. At Dartmouth, free tuition is provided for students from families with total incomes of $125,000 or less and possessing typical assets.[93] Dartmouth is also one of a few U.S. universities to eliminate undergraduate student loans and replace them with expanded scholarship grants.[94] In 2015, $88.8 million (~$112 million in 2023) in need-based scholarships were awarded to Dartmouth students.\n\n\nThe median family income of Dartmouth students is $200,400, with 58% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 14% from the bottom 60%.[95][*needs update*]\n\n\nHowever, a 2022 article from *The Dartmouth* disputes the college's claims by saying the following: \"To put it all together with the $9 million of student debt from the Class of 2021, this change in Dartmouth policy, hailed as \"eliminat[ing] loans for undergraduate students\" actually eliminated only about a quarter—27.4% to be exact—of student loans for undergraduate students. So, while Dartmouth gets glowing coverage in news publications across the country, 72.6% of the debt it saddles its students with remains.\"[96]\n\n\n\n### The Dartmouth Plan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tower Room in Baker Memorial Library\nDartmouth functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms. The Dartmouth Plan (or simply \"D-Plan\") is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student's academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman year and two terms of their senior year, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year.[97] However, students may petition to alter this plan so that they may be off during terms of their senior year or sophomore summer terms.[98] During all terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects.[97] The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for 12 total terms over the course of their academic career.[99]\n\n\nThe D-Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates. It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations, and has been described as \"a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds\".[30] Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect. It was modified in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity.\n\n\n\n### Board of trustees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dartmouth Hall was reconstructed in 1906.\nMain article: Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College\n\nDartmouth is governed by a board of trustees comprising the college president (*ex officio*), the state governor (*ex officio*), 13 trustees nominated and elected by the board (called \"charter trustees\"), and eight trustees nominated by alumni and elected by the board (\"alumni trustees\").[100] The nominees for alumni trustee are determined by a poll of the members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College, selecting from among names put forward by the Alumni Council or by alumni petition.\n\n\nAlthough the board elected its members from the two sources of nominees in equal proportions between 1891 and 2007,[101] the board decided in 2007 to add several new members, all charter trustees.[102] In the controversy that followed the decision, the Association of Alumni filed a lawsuit, although it later withdrew the action.[103][104] In 2008, the board added five new charter trustees.[105]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Dartmouth College buildings\n\n> \n> This is what a college is supposed to look like.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1953[106]\n\n![](image)Drawing of Wilson Hall, Dartmouth's first library building, by architect Samuel J. F. Thayer (1842–1893), which appeared in *American Architect and Building News* in March 1885.\nDartmouth College is situated in the rural town of Hanover, New Hampshire, located in the Upper Valley along the Connecticut River in New England. Its 269-acre (1.09 km2) campus is centered on a 5-acre (2 ha) \"Green\",[107] a former field of pine trees cleared in 1771.[108] Dartmouth is the largest private landowner of the town of Hanover,[109] and its total landholdings and facilities are worth an estimated $434 million.[110] In addition to its campus in Hanover, Dartmouth owns 4,500 acres (18 km2) of Mount Moosilauke in the White Mountains[111] and a 27,000-acre (110 km2) tract of land in northern New Hampshire known as the Second College Grant.[112]\n\n\n\n![](image)American elm on Dartmouth College campus, June 2011\nDartmouth's campus buildings vary in age from Wentworth and Thornton Halls of the 1820s (the oldest surviving buildings constructed by the college) to new dormitories and mathematics facilities completed in 2006.[113][114] Most of Dartmouth's buildings are designed in the Georgian colonial architecture style,[115][116][117] a theme which has been preserved in recent architectural additions.[118] The college has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus, earning it the grade of A− from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2008.[119][120]\n\n\nA notable feature of the Dartmouth campus is its many trees which (despite Dutch elm disease) include some 200 American elms.[121][122] The campus also has the largest Kentucky coffeetree in New Hampshire, at 91 ft tall.[123]\n\n\nWhile Dartmouth's campus is located in a rural setting, it is connected to several major cities by intercity bus services that directly serve Dartmouth and Hanover. Dartmouth Coach provides service from Hanover to South Station and Logan International Airport in Boston as well as New York City, while Greyhound Lines operates a daily route connecting Hanover and Montreal. All three cities are popular weekend/vacation destinations for Dartmouth students.\n\n\n\n### Academic facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Hopkins Center\nThe college's creative and performing arts facility is the Hopkins Center for the Arts (\"the Hop\"). Opened in 1962, the Hop houses the college's drama, music, film, and studio arts departments, as well as a woodshop, pottery studio, and jewelry studio which are open for use by students and faculty.[124] The building was designed by the famed architect Wallace Harrison, who would later design the similar-looking façade of Manhattan's Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center.[125] Its facilities include two theaters and one 900-seat auditorium.[124] The Hop is also the location of all student mailboxes (\"Hinman boxes\")[126] and the Courtyard Café dining facility.[127] The Hop is connected to the Hood Museum of Art, arguably North America's oldest museum in continuous operation,[128] and the Loew Auditorium, where films are screened.[129]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sherman Fairchild Physical Sciences Center\nIn addition to its 19 graduate programs in the arts and sciences, Dartmouth is home to three separate graduate schools. The Geisel School of Medicine is located in a complex on the north side of campus[130] and includes laboratories, classrooms, offices, and a biomedical library.[131] The Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center, located several miles to the south in Lebanon, New Hampshire, contains a 396-bed teaching hospital for the Medical School.[132] The Thayer School of Engineering and the Tuck School of Business are both located at the end of Tuck Mall, west of the center of campus and near the Connecticut River.[131] The Thayer School comprises two buildings;[131] Tuck has seven academic and administrative buildings, as well as several common areas.[133] The two graduate schools share a library, the Feldberg Business & Engineering Library.[133] In December 2018, Dartmouth began a major expansion of the west end of campus by breaking ground on the $200 million (~$239 million in 2023) Center for Engineering and Computer Science.[134] The Center will house the Computer Science department and Magnuson Center for Entrepreneurship. In October 2019, construction began on the Irving Institute of Energy and Society.[135] Both were completed by Spring 2022, and the Center for Engineering and Computer Science was renamed the Class of 1982 Engineering and Computer Science Center.[136]\n\n\nDartmouth's libraries are all part of the collective Dartmouth College Library, which comprises 2.48 million volumes and 6 million total resources, including videos, maps, sound recordings, and photographs.[53][137] Its specialized libraries include the Biomedical Libraries, Evans Map Room, Feldberg Business & Engineering Library, Jones Media Center, Rauner Special Collections Library, and Sherman Art Library. Baker-Berry Library is the main library at Dartmouth, consisting of a merger of the Baker Memorial Library (opened 1928) and the Berry Library (completed 2002).[138] Located on the northern side of the Green, Baker's 200-foot (61 m) tower is an iconic symbol of the college.[139][140][141]\n\n\n\n### Athletic facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Field\nDartmouth's original sports field was the Green, where students played cricket and old division football during the 19th century.[108] Today, two of Dartmouth's athletic facilities are located in the southeast corner of campus.[142] The center of athletic life is the Alumni Gymnasium, which includes the Karl Michael Competition Pool and the Spaulding Pool, a fitness center, a weight room, and a 1/13th-mile (123 m) indoor track.[143] Attached to Alumni Gymnasium is the Berry Sports Center, which contains basketball and volleyball courts (Leede Arena), as well as the Kresge Fitness Center.[144] Behind the Alumni Gymnasium is Memorial Field, a 15,600-seat stadium overlooking Dartmouth's football field and track.[145] The nearby Thompson Arena, designed by Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi and constructed in 1975, houses Dartmouth's ice rink.[146] Also visible from Memorial Field is the 91,800-square-foot (8,530 m2) Nathaniel Leverone Fieldhouse, home to the indoor track. The new softball field, Dartmouth Softball Park, was constructed in 2012, sharing parking facilities with Thompson arena and replacing Sachem Field, located over a mile from campus, as the primary softball facility.\n\n\nDartmouth's other athletic facilities in Hanover include the Friends of Dartmouth Rowing Boathouse and the old rowing house storage facility (both located along the Connecticut River), the Hanover Country Club, Dartmouth's oldest remaining athletic facility (established in 1899),[147] and the Corey Ford Rugby Clubhouse.[148] The college also maintains the Dartmouth Skiway, a 100-acre (0.40 km2) skiing facility located over two mountains near the Hanover campus in Lyme Center, New Hampshire,[149] that serves as the winter practice grounds for the Dartmouth ski team, which is a perennial contender for the NCAA Division I championship.\n\n\nDartmouth's close association and involvement in the development of the downhill skiing industry is featured in the 2010 book *Passion for Skiing* as well as the 2013 documentary based on the book *Passion for Snow*.[150]\n\n\n\n### Residential housing and student life facilities[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in the fall term of 2016, Dartmouth placed all undergraduate students in one of six House communities, similar to residential colleges, including Allen House, East Wheelock House, North Park House, School House, South House, and West House, alongside independent Living Learning Communities.[151] Dartmouth used to have nine residential communities located throughout campus, instead of ungrouped dormitories or residential colleges.[152] The dormitories varied in design from modern to traditional Georgian styles, and room arrangements range from singles to quads and apartment suites.[152] Since 2006, the college has guaranteed housing for students during their freshman and sophomore years.[153] More than 3,000 students elect to live in housing provided by college.[152]\n\n\nCampus meals are served by Dartmouth Dining Services, which operates 11 dining establishments around campus.[154] The Class of 1953 Commons, commonly referred to as \"Foco\", is the all-you-can-eat dining hall, located at the center of campus. Dartmouth also operates à la carte cafes around campus (Collis Café, Courtyard Café, Novack Café, The Fern Coffee & Tea Bar, Ramekin, and Café@Baker), a convenience store (Collis Market), and 3 snack bars located in the Allen House Commons (also called the \"Cube\"), McLaughlin Cluster, and East Wheelock Cluster.[155]\n\n\nThe Collis Center is the center of student life and programming, serving as what would be generically termed the \"student union\" or \"campus center\".[156] It contains a café, study space, common areas, and a number of administrative departments, including the Academic Skills Center.[157][158] Robinson Hall, next door to both the Collis Center and the Class of 1953 Commons, contains the offices of a number of student organizations, including the Dartmouth Outing Club and *The Dartmouth* daily newspaper.[159]\n\n\n\n#### House communities[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Founded\n | Total capacity\n | Main location capacity\n | Main location buildings[160] | Freshman buildings[161] | Color\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Allen House\n | 2016\n | 426\n | 257\n | Gile Hall, Streeter Hall, Lord Hall\n | Bissell Hall, Cohen Hall\n | Red\n |\n| East Wheelock House\n | 2016\n | 327\n | 327\n | Andres Hall, Zimmerman Hall, Morton Hall, McCulloch Hall\n |  | Orange\n |\n| North Park House\n | 2016\n | 214\n | 137\n | Thomas Hall, Goldstein Hall, Byrne II Hall, Rauner Hall, Bildner Hall, Berry Hall\n |  | Dark Blue\n |\n| School House\n | 2016\n | 561\n | 333\n | North, Mid- and South Massachusetts Halls, Hitchcock Hall\n | Brown Hall, Little Hall, Wheeler Hall\n | Light Blue\n |\n| South House\n | 2016\n | 592\n | 366\n | Topliff Hall, New Hampshire Hall, The Lodge\n | North, Mid- and South Fayerweather Halls, Richardson Hall\n | Black\n |\n| West House\n | 2016\n | 520\n | 335\n | Russell Sage Hall, Butterfield Hall, Fahey Hall, McLane Hall\n | French Hall, Judge Hall\n | Purple\n |\n\n\n* ![Lord Hall, Allen House](image)\n\nLord Hall, Allen House\n* ![Morton Hall, East Wheelock House](image)\n\nMorton Hall, East Wheelock House\n* ![Woodward Hall, North Park House](image)\n\nWoodward Hall, North Park House\n* ![Mid Massachusetts Hall, School House](image)\n\nMid Massachusetts Hall, School House\n* ![Topliff Hall, South House](image)\n\nTopliff Hall, South House\n* ![Russell Sage Hall, West House](image)\n\nRussell Sage Hall, West House\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[162] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 49%\n | 49 |\n| Asian | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Foreign national | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Hispanic | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Other[b] | 8%\n | 8 |\n| Black | 6%\n | 6 |\n| Native American | 1%\n | 1 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[c] | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Affluent[d] | 85%\n | 85 |\n\n\nDartmouth's Student Government represents students on issues related to student life.[163][164] [165] Annually, students elect a student body president, vice president, and undergraduate senate to represent them in the following academic year. In 2006, *The Princeton Review* ranked Dartmouth third in its \"Quality of Life\" category, and sixth for having the \"Happiest Students\".[166] Athletics and participation in the Greek system are the most popular campus activities.[167] In all, Dartmouth offers more than 350 organizations, teams, and sports.[168] The school is also home to a variety of longstanding traditions and celebrations and has a loyal alumni network; Dartmouth ranked #2 in \"The Princeton Review\" in 2006 for Best Alumni Network.[169]\n\n\nIn 2014, Dartmouth College was the third highest in the nation in \"total of reports of rape\" on their main campus, with 42 reports of rape.[170] The *Washington Post* attributed the high number of rape reports to the fact that a growing number of sexual assault victims feel comfortable enough to report sexual assaults that would have gone unreported in previous years.[170] In 2015, the Huffington Post reported that Dartmouth had the highest rate of bystander intervention of any college surveyed, with 57.7% of Dartmouth students reporting that they would take some sort of action if they saw someone acting in a \"sexually violent or harassing manner,\" compared to 45.5% of students nationally.[171]\n\n\nDartmouth fraternities have an extensive history of hazing and alcohol abuse, leading to police raids and accusations of sexual harassment.[172][173]\n\n\n\n### Student groups[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Dartmouth College student groups, Dartmouth College publications, and Dartmouth College Greek organizations\n\n![](image)Robinson Hall houses many of the College's student-run organizations, including the Dartmouth Outing Club. The building is a designated stop along the Appalachian Trail.\n![](image)Dartmouth Alpha Chi Alpha fraternity house\nDartmouth's more than 200 student organizations and clubs cover a wide range of interests.[174] In 2007, the college hosted eight academic groups, 17 cultural groups, two honor societies, 30 \"issue-oriented\" groups, 25 performing groups, 12 pre-professional groups, 20 publications, and 11 recreational groups.[175] Notable student groups include the nation's largest and oldest collegiate outdoors club, the Dartmouth Outing Club,[176] which includes the nationally recognized[177] Big Green Bus; the campus's oldest a cappella group, The Dartmouth Aires; the controversial independent newspaper *The Dartmouth Review*;[178] Dartmouth Student Government, the college's official undergraduate student government;,[164][165] and *The Dartmouth*, arguably the nation's oldest university newspaper.[179] *The Dartmouth* describes itself as \"America's Oldest College Newspaper, Founded 1799\".[179]\n\n\nPartially because of Dartmouth's rural, isolated location, the Greek system dating from the 1840s is one of the most popular social outlets for students.[167][180] Dartmouth is home to 32 recognized Greek houses: 17 fraternities, 12 sororities, and three coeducational organizations.[181] In 2007, roughly 70% of eligible students belonged to a Greek organization;[182] since 1987, students have not been permitted to join Greek organizations until their sophomore year.[183] Dartmouth College was among the first institutions of higher education to desegregate fraternity houses, doing so in the 1950s, and was involved in the movement to create coeducational Greek houses in the 1970s.[184] In the early first decade of the 21st century, campus-wide debate focused on a board of trustees recommendation that Greek organizations become \"substantially coeducational\";[185] this attempt to change the Greek system eventually failed.[186]\n\n\nDartmouth also has a number of secret societies, which are student- and alumni-led organizations often focused on preserving the history of the college and initiating service projects. Most prominent among them is the Sphinx society, housed in a prominent Egyptian tomb-like building near the center of campus. The Sphinx has been the subject of numerous rumors as to its facilities, practices, and membership.[187]\n\n\nThe college has an additional classification of social/residential organizations known as undergraduate societies.[188]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dartmouth Big Green\n\n![](image)A Dartmouth varsity hockey game against Princeton at Thompson Arena\nApproximately 20% of students participate in a varsity sport, and nearly 80% participate in some form of club, varsity, intramural, or other athletics.[189] In 2021, Dartmouth College fielded 33 intercollegiate varsity teams: 15 for men, 17 for women, and coeducational sailing and equestrian programs.[190] Dartmouth's athletic teams compete in the NCAA Division I eight-member Ivy League conference; some teams also participate in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC).[191] As is mandatory for the members of the Ivy League, Dartmouth College does not offer athletic scholarships.[191][192] In addition to the traditional American team sports (football, basketball, baseball, and ice hockey), Dartmouth competes at the varsity level in many other sports including track and field, softball, squash, sailing, tennis, rowing, soccer, skiing, and lacrosse.[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe college also offers 26 club and intramural sports such as fencing, rugby, water polo, figure skating, boxing, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and cricket, leading to a 75% participation rate in athletics among the undergraduate student body.[53][193] The Dartmouth Fencing Team, despite being entirely self-coached, won the USACFC club national championship in 2014.[194] The Dartmouth Men's Rugby Team, founded in 1951, has been ranked among the best collegiate teams in that sport, winning for example the Ivy Rugby Conference every year between 2008 and 2020.[195] The figure skating team won the national championship five straight times from 2004 through 2008.[196] In addition to the academic requirements for graduation, Dartmouth requires every undergraduate to complete a 50-yard (46 m) swim and three terms of physical education.[197]\n\n\n\n### Native Americans at Dartmouth[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 40th Dartmouth Powwow\nThe charter of Dartmouth College, granted to Wheelock in 1769, proclaims that the institution was created \"for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing and all parts of Learning ... as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth and any others\".[198] However, Wheelock primarily intended the college to educate white youth, and the few Native students that attended Dartmouth experienced much difficulty in an institution ostensibly dedicated to their education. The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Mohegan named Samson Occom, and at least some of those funds were used to help found the college.[199]\n\n\nThe college graduated only 19 Native Americans during its first 200 years.[199] In 1970, the college established Native American academic and social programs as part of a \"new dedication to increasing Native American enrollment\".[199] Since then, Dartmouth has graduated over 700 Native American students from over 200 different tribes, more than the other seven Ivy League universities combined.[199]\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dartmouth College traditions\n\nDartmouth is well known for its fierce school spirit and many traditions.[200] The college functions on a quarter system, and one weekend each term is set aside as a traditional celebratory event, known on campus as \"big weekends\"[201][202] or \"party weekends\".[203] In the fall term, Homecoming (officially called Dartmouth Night) is marked by a bonfire on the Green constructed by the freshman class.[204] Winter term is celebrated by Winter Carnival, a tradition started in 1911 by the Dartmouth Outing Club to promote winter sports. This tradition is the oldest in the United States, and subsequently went on to catch on at other New England colleges.[205][206] In the spring, Green Key is a weekend mostly devoted to campus parties and celebration.[207]\n\n\nThe summer term was formerly marked by Tubestock, an unofficial tradition in which the students used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the Connecticut River. Begun in 1986, Tubestock was ended in 2006 by town ordinance.[208] The Class of 2008, during their summer term on campus in 2006, replaced the defunct Tubestock with Fieldstock. This new celebration includes a barbecue, live music, and the revival of the 1970s and 1980s tradition of racing homemade chariots around the Green. Unlike Tubestock, Fieldstock is funded and supported by the college.[209]\n\n\nAnother longstanding tradition is four-day, student-run First-Year Trips for incoming freshmen, begun in 1935. Each trip concludes at the Moosilauke Ravine Lodge.[210] In 2011, over 96% of freshmen elected to participate.\n\n\n\n## Insignia and other representations[edit]\n\n\n### Motto and song[edit]\n\n\nDartmouth's motto, chosen by Eleazar Wheelock, is *Vox clamantis in deserto*. The Latin motto is literally translated as \"The voice of one crying in the wilderness\",[211][212] but is more often rendered as \"A voice crying out in the wilderness\".[1] The phrase appears five times in the Bible and is a reference to the college's location on what was once the frontier of European settlement.[212][213] Richard Hovey's \"Men of Dartmouth\" was elected as the best of Dartmouth's songs in 1896,[204] and became the school's official song in 1926.[214] The song was retitled to \"Alma Mater\" in the 1980s when its lyrics were changed to refer to women as well as men.[215]\n\n\n\n### Seal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seal of Dartmouth College\n\n![](image)Seal of Dartmouth College\nDartmouth's 1769 royal charter required the creation of a seal for use on official documents and diplomas.[198] The college's founder, Eleazar Wheelock, designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education.[212] Engraved by a Boston silversmith, the seal was ready by commencement of 1773. The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25, 1773, describing it as:\n\n\n\n\n> An Oval, circumscribed by a Line containing SIGILL: COL: DARTMUTH: NOV: HANT: IN AMERICA 1770. within projecting a Pine Grove on the Right, whence proceed Natives towards an Edifice two Storey on the left; which bears in a Label over the Grove these Words \"vox clamantis in deserto\" the whole supported by Religion on the Right and Justice on the Left, and bearing in a Triangle irradiate, with the Hebrew Words [El Shaddai], agreeable to the above Impression, be the common Seal under which to pass all Diplomas or Certificates of Degrees, and all other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College.[216]\n> \n> \n\n\nOn October 28, 1926, the trustees affirmed the charter's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone.[212] The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer William Addison Dwiggins to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from \"1770\" to \"1769\", to accord with the date of the college charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of \"1769\" to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use.[212] The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.[217]\n\n\n\n### Shield[edit]\n\n\nOn October 28, 1926, the trustees approved a \"Dartmouth College Shield\" for general use. Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On June 9, 1944, the trustees approved another coat of arms based on the shield part of the seal, this one by Canadian artist and designer Thoreau MacDonald. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins' seal, had its date changed from \"1770\" to \"1769\" around 1958.[212] That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.[217]\n\n\nCollege designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald's design.[218] The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of the Geisel School of Medicine, and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 micrometers across.[219] The design has appeared on Rudolph Ruzicka's Bicentennial Medal (Philadelphia Mint, 1969) and elsewhere.\n\n\n\n### Nickname, symbol, and mascot[edit]\n\n\nDartmouth has never had an official mascot.[220] The nickname \"The Big Green\",[221] originating in the 1860s, is based on students' adoption of a shade of forest green (\"Dartmouth Green\") as the school's official color in 1866.[222][223] Beginning in the 1920s, the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname \"the Indians\", a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists.[220] This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s, when its use came under criticism. In 1974, the Trustees declared the \"use of the [Indian] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education\".[224] Some alumni and students, as well as the conservative student newspaper, *The Dartmouth Review*, have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence,[225] but never succeeded in doing so.[226]\n\n\nVarious student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a mascot, but none has become \"official\". One proposal devised by the college humor magazine the *Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern* was Keggy the Keg, an anthropomorphic beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events. Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy,[227] the mascot has received approval from only the student government.[228] In November 2006, student government attempted to revive the \"Dartmoose\" as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former unofficial Indian mascot.[229]\n\n\n\n## Alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Dartmouth College alumni\n\nDartmouth's alumni are known for frequently donating to their alma mater.[230] Most start by giving to the Senior Class Gift. According to a 2008 article in *The Wall Street Journal* based on data from payscale.com, Dartmouth graduates also earn higher median salaries at least 10 years after graduation than alumni of any other American university surveyed.[231]\n\n\nBy 2008, Dartmouth had graduated 238 classes of students, and had over 60,000 living alumni in a variety of fields.[232] Finance, consulting, and technology have consistently been the most popular industries to enter for students.[233] Top employers of new graduates include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, McKinsey & Company, Bain & Company, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.\n\n\nNelson A. Rockefeller, 41st Vice President of the United States and 49th Governor of New York, graduated cum laude from Dartmouth with a degree in economics in 1930. Over 164 Dartmouth graduates have served in the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives,[234] such as Massachusetts statesman Daniel Webster.[234] Cabinet members of American presidents include Attorney General Amos T.

It is the seventh-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, founded in 1764 as the **College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations**. One of nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution,[6] it was the first college in the United States to codify in its charter that admission and instruction of students was to be equal regardless of their religious affiliation.[7]\n\n\nThe university is home to the oldest applied mathematics program in the United States, the oldest engineering program in the Ivy League, and the third-oldest medical program in New England.[a][8][9][10] It was one of the early doctoral-granting U.S. institutions in the late 19th century, adding masters and doctoral studies in 1887.[11] In 1969, it adopted its Open Curriculum after a period of student lobbying, which eliminated mandatory \"general education\" distribution requirements, made students \"the architects of their own syllabus\", and allowed them to take any course for a grade of satisfactory (Pass) or no-credit (Fail) which is unrecorded on external transcripts.[12][13] In 1971, Brown's coordinate women's institution, Pembroke College, was fully merged into the university.\n\n\nThe university comprises the College, the Graduate School, Alpert Medical School, the School of Engineering, the School of Public Health and the School of Professional Studies. Its international programs are organized through the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, and it is academically affiliated with the Marine Biological Laboratory and the Rhode Island School of Design; with the latter, it offers undergraduate and graduate dual degree programs.\n\n\nBrown's main campus is in the College Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island. The university is surrounded by a federally listed architectural district with a dense concentration of Colonial-era buildings. Benefit Street, which runs along the campus's western edge, has one of America's richest concentrations of 17th- and 18th-century architecture.[14][15] Brown's undergraduate admissions are among the most selective in the country, with an overall acceptance rate of 5% for the class of 2026.[16][17]\n\n\nAs of March 2022[update], 11 Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with Brown as alumni, faculty, or researchers, as well as 1 Fields Medalist, 7 National Humanities Medalists[b] and 11 National Medal of Science laureates. Other notable alumni include 27 Pulitzer Prize winners,[c] 21 billionaires,[d] 1 U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice, 4 U.S. Secretaries of State, over 100 members of the United States Congress,[24] 58 Rhodes Scholars,[25] 22 MacArthur Genius Fellows,[e] and 38 Olympic medalists.[26]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Brown University\n\n### Foundation and charter[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nPetitioner Ezra Stiles later became the seventh president of Yale College.\n![](image)\nPetitioner William Ellery signed the US Declaration of Independence in 1776.\n\nIn 1761, three residents of Newport, Rhode Island, drafted a petition to the colony's General Assembly:[27]\n\n\n\n\n> That your Petitioners propose to open a literary institution or School for instructing young Gentlemen in the Languages, Mathematics, Geography & History, & such other branches of Knowledge as shall be desired. That for this End... it will be necessary... to erect a public Building or Buildings for the boarding of the youth & the Residence of the Professors.\n> \n> \n\n\nThe three petitioners were Ezra Stiles, pastor of Newport's Second Congregational Church and future president of Yale University; William Ellery Jr., future signer of the United States Declaration of Independence; and Josias Lyndon, future governor of the colony. Stiles and Ellery later served as co-authors of the college's charter two years later. The editor of Stiles's papers observes, \"This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr. Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became Brown University.\"[27][28][11]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches was also interested in establishing a college in Rhode Island—home of the mother church of their denomination. At the time, the Baptists were unrepresented among the colonial colleges; the Congregationalists had Harvard and Yale, the Presbyterians had the College of New Jersey (later Princeton), and the Episcopalians had the College of William and Mary and King's College (later Columbia) while their local University of Pennsylvania was specifically founded without direct association with any particular denomination.[29] Isaac Backus, a historian of the New England Baptists and an inaugural trustee of Brown, wrote of the October 1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia:[11]\n\n\n\n\n> The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring them to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of the Baptists; ... Mr. James Manning, who took his first degree in New-Jersey college in September, 1762, was esteemed a suitable leader in this important work.\n> \n> \n\nJames Manning arrived at Newport in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who agreed to write the charter for the college. Stiles' first draft was read to the General Assembly in August 1763, and rejected by Baptist members who worried that their denomination would be underrepresented in the College Board of Fellows. A revised charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Rhode Island General Assembly on March 3, 1764, in East Greenwich.[30]\n\n\n![](image)\nBrown's first president, minister James Manning\n![](image)\nThe Ezra Stiles copy of Brown's 1764 charter\n\nIn September 1764, the inaugural meeting of the corporation—the college's governing body—was held in Newport's Old Colony House. Governor Stephen Hopkins was chosen chancellor, former and future governor Samuel Ward vice chancellor, John Tillinghast treasurer, and Thomas Eyres secretary. The charter stipulated that the board of trustees should be composed of 22 Baptists, five Quakers, five Episcopalians, and four Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, eight should be Baptists—including the college president—\"and the rest indifferently of any or all Denominations.\"[11]\n\n\nAt the time of its creation, Brown's charter was a uniquely progressive document.[31] Other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing doctrines, while Brown's charter asserted, \"Sectarian differences of opinions, shall not make any Part of the Public and Classical Instruction.\" The document additionally \"recognized more broadly and fundamentally than any other [university charter] the principle of denominational cooperation.\"[11] The oft-repeated statement that Brown's charter alone prohibited a religious test for College membership is inaccurate; other college charters were similarly liberal in that particular.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)This 1792 engraving is the first published image of Brown. University Hall stands on the right while the President's House sits on the left.\nThe college was founded as Rhode Island College, at the site of the First Baptist Church in Warren, Rhode Island.[33] Manning was sworn in as the college's first president in 1765 and remained in the role until 1791. In 1766, the college authorized the Reverend Morgan Edwards to travel to Europe to \"solicit Benefactions for this Institution\".[32] During his year-and-a-half stay in the British Isles, Edwards secured funding from benefactors including Thomas Penn and Benjamin Franklin.[32]\n\n\nIn 1770, the college moved from Warren to Providence. To establish a campus, John and Moses Brown purchased a four-acre lot on the crest of College Hill on behalf of the school. The majority of the property fell within the bounds of the original home lot of Chad Brown, an ancestor of the Browns and one of the original proprietors of Providence Plantations.[34] After the college was relocated to the city, work began on constructing its first building.\n\n\nA building committee, organized by the corporation, developed plans for the college's first purpose-built edifice, finalizing a design on February 9, 1770. The subsequent structure, referred to as \"The College Edifice\" and later as University Hall, may have been modeled on Nassau Hall, built 14 years prior at the College of New Jersey. President Manning, an active member of the building process, was educated at Princeton and might have suggested that Brown's first building resemble that of his alma mater.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Brown family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Following the gift of Nicholas Brown Jr. (Class of 1786), the university was renamed in his honor.\nNicholas Brown, John Brown, Joseph Brown, and Moses Brown were instrumental in moving the college to Providence, constructing its first building, and securing its endowment. Joseph became a professor of natural philosophy at the college; John served as its treasurer from 1775 to 1796; and Nicholas Sr's son Nicholas Brown Jr. succeeded his uncle as treasurer from 1796 to 1825.[36]\n\n\nOn September 8, 1803, the corporation voted, \"That the donation of $5,000, if made to this College within one Year from the late Commencement, shall entitle the donor to name the College.\" The following year, the appeal was answered by College Treasurer Nicholas Brown Jr. In a letter dated September 6, 1804, Brown committed \"a donation of Five Thousand Dollars to Rhode Island College, to remain in perpetuity as a fund for the establishment of a Professorship of Oratory and Belles Letters.\" In recognition of the gift, the corporation on the same day voted, \"That this College be called and known in all future time by the Name of Brown University.\"[37] Over the years, the benefactions of Nicholas Brown Jr., totaled nearly $160,000 and included funds for building Hope College (1821–22) and Manning Hall (1834–35).\n\n\nIn 1904, the John Carter Brown Library was established as an independently funded research library on Brown's campus; the library's collection was founded on that of John Carter Brown, son of Nicholas Brown Jr.\n\n\nThe Brown family was involved in various business ventures in Rhode Island, and accrued wealth both directly and indirectly from the transatlantic slave trade. The family was divided on the issue of slavery. John Brown had defended slavery, while Moses and Nicholas Brown Jr. were fervent abolitionists.\n\n\nIn 2003, under the tenure of President Ruth Simmons, the university established a steering committee to investigate these ties of the university to slavery and recommend a strategy to address them.[38]\n\n\n\n#### American Revolution[edit]\n\n\nWith British vessels patrolling Narragansett Bay in the fall of 1776, the college library was moved out of Providence for safekeeping. During the subsequent American Revolutionary War, Brown's University Hall was used to house French and other revolutionary troops led by General George Washington and the Comte de Rochambeau as they waited to commence the march of 1781 that led to the Siege of Yorktown and the Battle of the Chesapeake. This has been celebrated as marking the defeat of the British and the end of the war. The building functioned as barracks and hospital from December 10, 1776, to April 20, 1780, and as a hospital for French troops from June 26, 1780, to May 27, 1782.[11]\n\n\nA number of Brown's founders and alumni played roles in the American Revolution and subsequent founding of the United States. Brown's first chancellor, Stephen Hopkins, served as a delegate to the Colonial Congress in Albany in 1754, and to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776. James Manning represented Rhode Island at the Congress of the Confederation, while concurrently serving as Brown's first president.[39] Two of Brown's founders, William Ellery and Stephen Hopkins signed the Declaration of Independence.\n\n\nJames Mitchell Varnum, who graduated from Brown with honors in 1769, served as one of General George Washington's Continental Army brigadier generals and later as major general in command of the entire Rhode Island militia. Varnum is noted as the founder and commander of the 1st Rhode Island Regiment, widely regarded as the first Black battalion in U.S. military history.[40] David Howell, who graduated with an A.M. in 1769, served as a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1782 to 1785.\n\n\n\n### Presidents[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nBrown's 2nd President, Jonathan Maxcy, was the first alum to serve as president.\n![](image)\nBrown's 4th President, Francis Wayland, urged American universities to adopt a broader curriculum.\n![](image)\nBrown's 18th President, Ruth Simmons, was the Ivy League's first African-American president.\n![](image)\nBrown's 19th President, Christina Paxson, has served in the role since 2012.\nMain article: List of Presidents of Brown University\n\nNineteen individuals have served as presidents of the university since its founding in 1764. Since 2012, Christina Hull Paxson has served as president. Paxson had previously served as dean of Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs and chair of Princeton's economics department.[41] Paxson's immediate predecessor, Ruth Simmons, is noted as the first African American president of an Ivy League institution.[42] Other presidents of note include academic, Vartan Gregorian; and philosopher and economist, Francis Wayland.\n\n\n\n### New Curriculum[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Open Curriculum (Brown University)\n\nIn 1966, the first Group Independent Study Project (GISP) at Brown was formed, involving 80 students and 15 professors. The GISP was inspired by student-initiated experimental schools, especially San Francisco State College, and sought ways to \"put students at the center of their education\" and \"teach students how to think rather than just teaching facts\".[43]\n\n\nMembers of the GISP, Ira Magaziner and Elliot Maxwell published a paper of their findings titled, \"Draft of a Working Paper for Education at Brown University.\"[44][43] The paper made proposals for a new curriculum, including interdisciplinary freshman-year courses that would introduce \"modes of thought,\" with instruction from faculty from different disciplines as well as for an end to letter grades. The following year Magaziner began organizing the student body to press for the reforms, organizing discussions and protests.[45]\n\n\nIn 1968, university president Ray Heffner established a Special Committee on Curricular Philosophy. Composed of administrators, the committee was tasked with developing specific reforms and producing recommendations. A report, produced by the committee, was presented to the faculty, which voted the New Curriculum into existence on May 7, 1969. Its key features included:[46]\n\n\n\n* Modes of Thought courses for first-year students\n* The introduction of interdisciplinary courses\n* The abandonment of \"general education\" distribution requirements\n* The Satisfactory/No Credit (S/NC) grading option\n* The ABC/No Credit grading system, which eliminated pluses, minuses, and D's; a grade of \"No Credit\" (equivalent to F's at other institutions) would not appear on external transcripts.\n\n\nThe Modes of Thought course was discontinued early on, but the other elements remain in place. In 2006, the reintroduction of plus/minus grading was proposed in response to concerns regarding grade inflation. The idea was rejected by the College Curriculum Council after canvassing alumni, faculty, and students, including the original authors of the Magaziner-Maxwell Report.[47]\n\n\n\n### \"Slavery and Justice\" report[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Slavery Memorial* was designed by Martin Puryear and dedicated in 2014.\nIn 2003, then-university president Ruth Simmons launched a steering committee to research Brown's eighteenth-century ties to slavery. In October 2006, the committee released a report documenting its findings.[48][49]\n\n\nTitled \"Slavery and Justice\", the document detailed the ways in which the university benefited both directly and indirectly from the transatlantic slave trade and the labor of enslaved people. The report also included seven recommendations for how the university should address this legacy.[50] Brown has since completed a number of these recommendations including the establishment of its Center for the Study of Slavery and Justice, the construction of its *Slavery Memorial*, and the funding of a $10 million permanent endowment for Providence Public Schools.[50][51]\n\n\nThe Slavery and Justice report marked the first major effort by an American university to address its ties to slavery and prompted other institutions to undertake similar processes.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Coat of arms[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Coat of Arms of Brown University\n\nBrown's coat of arms was created in 1834. The prior year, president Francis Wayland had commissioned a committee to update the school's original seal to match the name the university had adopted in 1804. Central in the coat of arms is a white escutcheon divided into four sectors by a red cross. Within each sector of the coat of arms lies an open book. Above the shield is a crest consisting of the upper half of a sun in splendor among the clouds atop a red and white torse.[54]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nUniversity Hall, Brown's oldest building, was constructed in 1770 and is a National Historic Landmark\n![](image)\nSoldiers Memorial Gate (1921) long marked the eastern edge of Brown's campus.\n\nBrown is the largest institutional landowner in Providence, with properties on College Hill and in the Jewelry District.[55] The university was built contemporaneously with the eighteenth and nineteenth-century precincts surrounding it, making Brown's campus tightly integrated into Providence's urban fabric. Among the noted architects who have shaped Brown's campus are McKim, Mead & White, Philip Johnson, Rafael Viñoly, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and Robert A. M. Stern.[56]\n\n\n\n### Main campus[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Brown University buildings\nBrown's main campus, comprises 235 buildings and 143 acres (0.58 km2) in the East Side neighborhood of College Hill. The university's central campus sits on a 15-acre (6.1-hectare) block bounded by Waterman, Prospect, George, and Thayer Streets; newer buildings extend northward, eastward, and southward. Brown's core, historic campus, constructed primary between 1770 and 1926, is defined by three greens: the Front or Quiet Green, the Middle or College Green, and the Ruth J. Simmons Quadrangle (historically known as Lincoln Field).[57][58] A brick and wrought-iron fence punctuated by decorative gates and arches traces the block's perimeter. This section of campus is primarily Georgian and Richardsonian Romanesque in its architectural character.[57]\n\n\nTo the south of the central campus are academic buildings and residential quadrangles, including Wriston, Keeney, and Gregorian quadrangles. Immediately to the east of the campus core sit Sciences Park and Brown's School of Engineering. North of the central campus are performing and visual arts facilities, life sciences labs, and the Pembroke Campus, which houses both dormitories and academic buildings. Facing the western edge of the central campus sit two of the Brown's seven libraries, the John Hay Library and the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library.\n\n\nThe university's campus is contiguous with that of the Rhode Island School of Design, which is located immediately to Brown's west, along the slope of College Hill.\n\n\n\n#### Van Wickle Gates[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Van Wickle Gates\n\n![](image)The Van Wickle Gates stand at the crest of College Hill\nBuilt in 1901, the Van Wickle Gates are a set of wrought iron gates that stand at the western edge of Brown's campus. The larger main gate is flanked by two smaller side gates. At Convocation the central gate opens inward to admit the procession of new students; at Commencement, the gate opens outward for the procession of graduates.[59] A Brown superstition holds that students who walk through the central gate a second time prematurely will not graduate, although walking backward is said to cancel the hex.\n\n\n\n### John Hay Library[edit]\n\n\nMain article: John Hay Library\n\n![](image)The John Hay Library is home to rare books, special collections, and the university archives.The John Hay Library is the second oldest library on campus.[60] Opened in 1910, the library is named for John Hay (class of 1858), private secretary to Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State under William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. The construction of the building was funded in large part by Hay's friend, Andrew Carnegie, who contributed half of the $300,000 cost of construction.[61]\n\n\nThe John Hay Library serves as the repository of the university's archives, rare books and manuscripts, and special collections. Noteworthy among the latter are the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection[62] (described as \"the foremost American collection of material devoted to the history and iconography of soldiers and soldiering\"),[63] the Harris Collection of American Poetry and Plays (described as \"the largest and most comprehensive collection of its kind in any research library\"), the Lownes Collection of the History of Science (described as \"one of the three most important private collections of books of science in America\"), and the papers of H. P. Lovecraft. The Hay Library is home to one of the broadest collections of incunabula in the Americas, one of Brown's two Shakespeare First Folios, the manuscript of George Orwell's *Nineteen Eighty-Four,* and three books bound in human skin.[64]\n\n\n\n### John Carter Brown Library[edit]\n\n\nMain article: John Carter Brown Library\n\n![](image)The John Carter Brown Library is one of the world's leading repositories of books, maps, and manuscripts relating to the colonial Americas.[65]\nFounded in 1846, the John Carter Brown Library is generally regarded as the world's leading collection of primary historical sources relating to the exploration and colonization of the Americas. While administered and funded separately from the university, the library has been owned by Brown and located on its campus since 1904.[66]\n\n\nThe library contains the best preserved of the eleven surviving copies of the Bay Psalm Book—the earliest extant book printed in British North America and the most expensive printed book in the world.[67] Other holdings include a Shakespeare First Folio and the world's largest collection of 16th century Mexican texts.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)The galleries of Brown's anthropology museum, the Haffenreffer, are located in Manning Hall.\n### Haffenreffer Museum[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology\n\nThe exhibition galleries of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, Brown's teaching museum, are located in Manning Hall on the campus's main green. Its one million artifacts, available for research and educational purposes, are located at its Collections Research Center in Bristol, Rhode Island.[69] The museum's goal is to inspire creative and critical thinking about culture by fostering an interdisciplinary understanding of the material world. It provides opportunities for faculty and students to work with collections and the public, teaching through objects and programs in classrooms and exhibitions. The museum sponsors lectures and events in all areas of anthropology and also runs an extensive program of outreach to local schools.\n\n\n\n### Annmary Brown Memorial[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Annmary Brown Memorial\n\nThe Annmary Brown Memorial was constructed from 1903 to 1907 by the politician, Civil War veteran, and book collector General Rush Hawkins, as a mausoleum for his wife, Annmary Brown, a member of the Brown family. In addition to its crypt—the final repository for Brown and Hawkins—the Memorial includes works of art from Hawkins's private collection, including paintings by Angelica Kauffman, Peter Paul Rubens, Gilbert Stuart, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Benjamin West, and Eastman Johnson, among others. His collection of over 450 incunabula was relocated to the John Hay Library in 1990.[70] Today the Memorial is home to Brown's Medieval Studies and Renaissance Studies programs.\n\n\n\n### The Walk[edit]\n\n\nThe Walk, a landscaped pedestrian corridor, connects the Pembroke Campus to the main campus. It runs parallel to Thayer Street and serves as a primary axis of campus, extending from Ruth Simmons Quadrangle at its southern terminus to the Meeting Street entrance to the Pembroke Campus at its northern end.[71][72] The walk is bordered by departmental buildings as well as the Lindemann Performing Arts Center and Granoff Center for the Creative Arts\n\n\nThe corridor is home to public art including sculptures by Maya Lin and Tom Friedman.[73]\n\n\n\n### Pembroke campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Three dormitories, Metcalf Hall (1919), Andrews Hall (1947), and Miller Hall (1910), formed the heart of Pembroke College and now serve as freshman residences.\nThe Women's College in Brown University, known as Pembroke College, was founded in October 1891. Upon its 1971 merger with the College of Brown University, Pembroke's campus was absorbed into the larger Brown campus. The Pembroke campus is bordered by Meeting, Brown, Bowen, and Thayer Streets and sits three blocks north of Brown's central campus. The campus is dominated by brick architecture, largely of the Georgian and Victorian styles. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907), and Metcalf Hall (1919), while the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910). The quadrangle culminates on the north with Andrews Hall (1947).\n\n\nEast Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, originally served as the campus of Bryant University. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to relocate to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brown purchased their Providence campus for $5 million. The transaction expanded the Brown campus by 10 acres (40,000 m2) and 26 buildings. In 1971, Brown renamed the area East Campus.[74] Today, the area is largely used for dormitories.\n\n\nThayer Street runs through Brown's main campus. As a commercial corridor frequented by students, Thayer is comparable to Harvard Square or Berkeley's Telegraph Avenue. Wickenden Street, in the adjacent Fox Point neighborhood, is another commercial street similarly popular among students.\n\n\nBuilt in 1925, Brown Stadium—the home of the school's football team—is located approximately a mile and a half northeast of the university's central campus.[75] Marston Boathouse, the home of Brown's crew teams, lies on the Seekonk River, to the southeast of campus. Brown's sailing teams are based out of the Ted Turner Sailing Pavilion at the Edgewood Yacht Club in adjacent Cranston.\n\n\nSince 2011, Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School has been located in Providence's historic Jewelry District, near the medical campus of Brown's teaching hospitals, Rhode Island Hospital and the Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island. Other university facilities, including molecular medicine labs and administrative offices, are likewise located in the area.[76][77]\n\n\nBrown's School of Public Health occupies a landmark modernist building along the Providence River. Other Brown properties include the 376-acre (1.52 km2) Mount Hope Grant in Bristol, Rhode Island, an important Native American site noted as a location of King Philip's War. Brown's Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology Collection Research Center, particularly strong in Native American items, is located in the Mount Hope Grant.\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nBrown has committed to \"minimize its energy use, reduce negative environmental impacts, and promote environmental stewardship.\"[78] Since 2010, the university has required all new buildings meet LEED silver standards.[79] Between 2007 and 2018, Brown reduced its greenhouse emissions by 27 percent; the majority of this reduction is attributable to the university's Thermal Efficiency Project which converted its central heating plant from a steam-powered system to a hot water-powered system.[80]\n\n\nIn 2020, Brown announced it had sold 90 percent of its fossil fuel investments as part of a broader divestment from direct investments and managed funds that focus on fossil fuels.[81] In 2021, the university adopted the goal of reducing quantifiable campus emissions by 75 percent by 2025 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2040.[82] Brown is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions. [83]\n\n\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Brown would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (*104*) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (*25*).[84]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### The College[edit]\n\n\nMain article: College of Brown University\n\n![](image)Robinson Hall (1878) was designed by Walker and Gould in the Venetian Gothic style to house Brown's library.\nFounded in 1764, The College is Brown's oldest school. About 7,200 undergraduate students are enrolled in the college [*when?*], and 81 concentrations are offered. For the graduating class of 2020, the most popular concentrations were Computer Science, Economics, Biology, History, Applied Mathematics, International Relations, and Political Science. A quarter of Brown undergraduates complete more than one concentration before graduating.[85] If the existing programs do not align with their intended curricular interests, undergraduates may design and pursue independent concentrations.[86]\n\n\nAround 35 percent [*needs update*] of undergraduates pursue graduate or professional study immediately, 60 percent within 5 years, and 80 percent within 10 years.[87] For the Class of 2009, 56 percent of all undergraduate alumni have since earned graduate degrees. Among undergraduate alumni who go on to receive graduate degrees, the most common degrees earned are J.D. (16%), M.D. (14%), M.A. (14%), M.Sc. (14%), and Ph.D. (11%). The most common institutions from which undergraduate alumni earn graduate degrees are Brown University, Columbia University, and Harvard University.[88]\n\n\nThe highest fields of employment for undergraduate alumni ten years after graduation are education and higher education (15%), medicine (9%), business and finance (9%), law (8%), and computing and technology (7%).[88]\n\n\n\n### Brown and RISD[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The List Art Center, built 1969–71, designed by Philip Johnson, houses Brown's Department of Visual Art and the David Winton Bell Gallery.\nSince its 1893 relocation to College Hill, Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) has bordered Brown to its west. Since 1900, Brown and RISD students have been able to cross-register at the two institutions, with Brown students permitted to take as many as four courses at RISD to count towards their Brown degree.[89] The two institutions partner to provide various student-life services and the two student bodies compose a synergy in the College Hill cultural scene.\n\n\n\n#### Dual Degree Program[edit]\n\n\nAfter several years of discussion between the two institutions and several students pursuing dual degrees unofficially, Brown and RISD formally established a five-year dual degree program in 2007, with the first class matriculating in the fall of 2008.[90] The Brown|RISD Dual Degree Program, among the most selective in the country, offered admission to 20 of the 725 applicants for the class entering in autumn 2020, for an acceptance rate of 2.7%.[91] The program combines the complementary strengths of the two institutions, integrating studio art and design at RISD with Brown's academic offerings. Students are admitted to the Dual Degree Program for a course lasting five years and culminating in both the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree from Brown and the Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree from RISD. Prospective students must apply to the two schools separately and be accepted by separate admissions committees. Their application must then be approved by a third Brown|RISD joint committee.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Granoff Center, designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, hosts the annual Brown|RISD Dual Degree exhibition.\nAdmitted students spend the first year in residence at RISD completing its first-year Experimental and Foundation Studies curriculum while taking up to three Brown classes. Students spend their second year in residence at Brown, during which students take mainly Brown courses while starting on their RISD major requirements. In the third, fourth, and fifth years, students can elect to live at either school or off-campus, and course distribution is determined by the requirements of each student's unique combination of Brown concentration and RISD major. Program participants are noted for their creative and original approach to cross-disciplinary opportunities, combining, for example, industrial design with engineering, or anatomical illustration with human biology, or philosophy with sculpture, or architecture with urban studies. An annual \"BRDD Exhibition\" is a well-publicized and heavily attended event, drawing interest and attendees from the broader world of industry, design, the media, and the fine arts.\n\n\n\n#### MADE Program[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, the two schools announced the establishment of a new joint Master of Arts in Design Engineering program. Abbreviated as MADE, the program intends to combine RISD's programs in industrial design with Brown's programs in engineering. The program is administered through Brown's School of Engineering and RISD's Architecture and Design Division.[92]\n\n\n\n### Theatre and playwriting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lyman Hall, built 1890–92, houses the Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies.\nBrown's theatre and playwriting programs are among the best-regarded in the country.[93][94] Six Brown graduates have received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama; Alfred Uhry '58, Lynn Nottage '86, Ayad Akhtar '93, Nilo Cruz '94, Quiara Alegría Hudes '04, and Jackie Sibblies Drury MFA '04.[95] In *American Theater* magazine's 2009 ranking of the most-produced American plays, Brown graduates occupied four of the top five places—Peter Nachtrieb '97, Rachel Sheinkin '89, Sarah Ruhl '97, and Stephen Karam '02.[96][97]\n\n\n\nThe undergraduate concentration encompasses programs in theatre history, performance theory, playwriting, dramaturgy, acting, directing, dance, speech, and technical production. Applications for doctoral and master's degree programs are made through the University Graduate School. Master's degrees in acting and directing are pursued in conjunction with the Brown/Trinity Rep MFA program, which partners with the Trinity Repertory Company, a local regional theatre.[98]\n\n![](image)Aerial view of the Brown University English department\n### Writing programs[edit]\n\n\nWriting at Brown—fiction, non-fiction, poetry, playwriting, screenwriting, electronic writing, mixed media, and the undergraduate writing proficiency requirement—is catered for by various centers and degree programs, and a faculty that has long included nationally and internationally known authors. The undergraduate concentration in literary arts offers courses in fiction, poetry, screenwriting, literary hypermedia, and translation. Graduate programs include the fiction and poetry MFA writing programs in the literary arts department and the MFA playwriting program in the theatre arts and performance studies department. The non-fiction writing program is offered in the English department. Screenwriting and cinema narrativity courses are offered in the departments of literary arts and modern culture and media. The undergraduate writing proficiency requirement is supported by the Writing Center.\n\n\n\n#### Author prizewinners[edit]\n\n\nAlumni authors take their degrees across the spectrum of degree concentrations, but a gauge of the strength of writing at Brown is the number of major national writing prizes won. To note only winners since the year 2000: Pulitzer Prize for Fiction-winners Jeffrey Eugenides '82 (2003), Marilynne Robinson '66 (2005), and Andrew Sean Greer '92 (2018); British Orange Prize-winners Marilynne Robinson '66 (2009) and Madeline Miller '00 (2012); Pulitzer Prize for Drama-winners Nilo Cruz '94 (2003), Lynn Nottage '86 (twice, 2009, 2017), Quiara Alegría Hudes '04 (2012), Ayad Akhtar '93 (2013), and Jackie Sibblies Drury MFA '04 (2019); Pulitzer Prize for Biography-winners David Kertzer '69 (2015) and Benjamin Moser '98 (2020); Pulitzer Prize for Journalism-winners James Risen '77 (2006), Gareth Cook '91 (2005), Tony Horwitz '80 (1995), Usha Lee McFarling '89 (2007), David Rohde '90 (1996), Kathryn Schulz '96 (2016), and Alissa J. Rubin '80 (2016); Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction-winner James Forman Jr. '88 (2018); Pulitzer Prize for History-winner Marcia Chatelain PhD '08 (2021); Pulitzer Prize for Criticism-winner Salamishah Tillet MAT '97 (2022); and Pulitzer Prize for Poetry-winner Peter Balakian PhD '80 (2016)[99][100]\n\n\n\n### Computer science[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Brown Computing Laboratory, designed by Philip Johnson\nBrown began offering computer science courses through the departments of Economics and Applied Mathematics in 1956 when it acquired an IBM machine. Brown added an IBM 650 in January 1958, the only one of its type between Hartford and Boston. In 1960, Brown opened its first dedicated computer building. The facility, designed by Philip Johnson, received an IBM 7070 computer the following year. Brown granted computer sciences full Departmental status in 1979. In 2009, IBM and Brown announced the installation of a supercomputer (by teraflops standards), the most powerful in the southeastern New England region.[101]\n\n\nIn the 1960s, Andries van Dam along with Ted Nelson, and Bob Wallace invented The Hypertext Editing Systems, HES and FRESS while at Brown. Nelson coined the word *hypertext* while Van Dam's students helped originate XML, XSLT, and related Web standards. Among the school's computer science alumni are principal architect of the Classic Mac OS, Andy Hertzfeld; principal architect of the Intel 80386 and Intel 80486 microprocessors, John Crawford; former CEO of Apple, John Sculley; and digital effects programmer Masi Oka.[102][103] Other alumni include former CS department head at MIT, John Guttag, Workday founder, Aneel Bhusri, MongoDB founder Eliot Horowitz, Figma founders Dylan Field and Evan Wallace; and OpenSea founder Devin Finzer.[104]\n\n\nThe character \"Andy\" in the animated film *Toy Story* is purportedly an homage to professor Van Dam from his students employed at Pixar.[105]\n\n\nBetween 2012 and 2018, the number of concentrators in CS tripled.[106] In 2017, computer science overtook economics as the school's most popular undergraduate concentration.[107]\n\n\n\n### Applied mathematics[edit]\n\n\nBrown's program in applied mathematics was established in 1941 making it the oldest such program in the United States.[8][108] The division is highly ranked and regarded nationally and internationally.[109][110] Among the 67 recipients of the Timoshenko Medal, 22 have been affiliated with Brown's applied mathematics division as faculty, researchers, or students.[f]\n\n\n\n### The Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nGreek Revival Rhode Island Hall (1840) on the Main Green is home to the Joukowsky Institute.\n![](image)\nThe Department of Egyptology and Assyriology in Wilbour Hall (1888). Wilbour Hall is named for Egyptologist Charles Edwin Wilbour (class of 1854).\n\nMain article: Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World\n\nEstablished in 2004, the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World is Brown's interdisciplinary research center for archeology and ancient studies. The institute pursues fieldwork, excavations, regional surveys, and academic study of the archaeology and art of the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt, and Western Asia from the Levant to the Caucasus.[111] The institute has a very active fieldwork profile, with faculty-led excavations and regional surveys presently in Petra (Jordan), Abydos (Egypt), Turkey, Sudan, Italy, Mexico, Guatemala, Montserrat, and Providence.\n\n\nThe Joukowsky Institute's faculty includes cross-appointments from the departments of Egyptology, Assyriology, Classics, Anthropology, and History of Art and Architecture. Faculty research and publication areas include Greek and Roman art and architecture, landscape archaeology, urban and religious architecture of the Levant, Roman provincial studies, the Aegean Bronze Age, and the archaeology of the Caucasus. The institute offers visiting teaching appointments and postdoctoral fellowships which have, in recent years, included Near Eastern Archaeology and Art, Classical Archaeology and Art, Islamic Archaeology and Art, and Archaeology and Media Studies.\n\n\n**Egyptology and Assyriology**\n\n\nFacing the Joukowsky Institute, across the Front Green, is the Department of Egyptology and Assyriology, formed in 2006 by the merger of Brown's departments of Egyptology and History of Mathematics. It is one of only a handful of such departments in the United States.[112] The curricular focus is on three principal areas: Egyptology, Assyriology, and the history of the ancient exact sciences (astronomy, astrology, and mathematics). Many courses in the department are open to all Brown undergraduates without prerequisites and include archaeology, languages, history, and Egyptian and Mesopotamian religions, literature, and science. Students concentrating in the department choose a track of either Egyptology or Assyriology. Graduate-level study comprises three tracks to the doctoral degree: Egyptology, Assyriology, or the History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity.\n\n\n\n### The Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs\n![](image)\nThe main building at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs was designed by Rafael Viñoly in 2001\n![](image)\nStephen Robert Hall (2018) at the Watson Institute, was designed by Toshiko Mori\n\nThe Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, Brown's center for the study of global Issues and public affairs, is one of the leading institutes of its type in the country. The institute occupies facilities designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael Viñoly and Japanese architect Toshiko Mori. The institute was initially endowed by Thomas Watson Jr. (Class of 1937), former Ambassador to the Soviet Union and longtime president of IBM.\n\n\nInstitute faculty and faculty emeritus include Italian prime minister and European Commission president Romano Prodi,[113] Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso,[114] Chilean president Ricardo Lagos Escobar,[115] Mexican novelist and statesman Carlos Fuentes,[116] Brazilian statesman and United Nations commission head Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro,[117] Indian foreign minister and ambassador to the United States Nirupama Rao,[118] American diplomat and Dayton Peace Accords author Richard Holbrooke (Class of 1962),[119] and Sergei Khrushchev,[120] editor of the papers of his father Nikita Khrushchev, leader of the Soviet Union.\n\n\nThe institute's curricular interest is organized into the principal themes of development, security, and governance—with further focuses on globalization, economic uncertainty, security threats, environmental degradation, and poverty. Six Brown undergraduate concentrations are hosted by the Watson Institute: Development Studies, International and Public Affairs, International Relations, Latin American and Caribbean Studies, Middle East Studies, Public Policy, and South Asian Studies. Graduate programs offered at the Watson Institute include the Graduate Program in Development (Ph.D.) and the Master of Public Affairs (M.P.A) Program. The institute also offers postdoctoral, professional development, and global outreach programming. In support of these programs, the institute houses various centers, including the Brazil Initiative, Brown-India Initiative, China Initiative, Middle East Studies Center, The Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS), and the Taubman Center for Public Policy. In recent years, the most internationally cited product of the Watson Institute has been its Costs of War Project, first released in 2011 and continuously updated since. The project comprises a team of economists, anthropologists, political scientists, legal experts, and physicians, and seeks to calculate the economic costs, human casualties, and impact on civil liberties of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan since 2001.[121]\n\n\n\n### The School of Engineering[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brown University School of Engineering\n\n![](image)The Brown University Engineering Research Center, completed in 2018 and designed by KieranTimberlake[122]\nEstablished in 1847, Brown's engineering program is the oldest in the Ivy League and the third oldest civilian engineering program in the country.[g] In 1916, Brown's departments of electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering were merged into a single Division of Engineering. In 2010 the division was elevated to a School of Engineering.[123]\n\n\nEngineering at Brown is especially interdisciplinary. The school is organized without the traditional departments or boundaries found at most schools and follows a model of connectivity between disciplines—including biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, the humanities, and the social sciences. The school practices an innovative clustering of faculties in which engineers team with non-engineers to bring a convergence of ideas.\n\n\nStudent teams have launched two CubeSats with the support of the School of Engineering. Brown Space Engineering developed EQUiSat a 1U satellite, and another interdisciplinary team developed SBUDNIC a 3U satellite.[124][125]\n\n\n\n### IE Brown Executive MBA Dual Degree Program[edit]\n\n\nSince 2009, Brown has developed an Executive MBA program in conjunction with one of the leading Business Schools in Europe, IE Business School in Madrid. This relationship has since strengthened resulting in both institutions offering a dual degree program.[126] In this partnership, Brown provides its traditional coursework while IE provides most of the business-related subjects making a differentiated alternative program to other Ivy League's EMBAs.[127] The cohort typically consists of 25–30 EMBA candidates from some 20 countries.[128] Classes are held in Providence, Madrid, Cape Town and Online.\n\n\n\n![](image)Pembroke Hall (1897) houses the administrative offices of the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women.\n### The Pembroke Center[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women\n\nThe Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women was established at Brown in 1981 by Joan Wallach Scott as an interdisciplinary research center on gender.[129] The center is named for Pembroke College, Brown's former women's college, and is affiliated with Brown's Sarah Doyle Women's Center. The Pembroke Center supports Brown's undergraduate concentration in Gender and Sexuality Studies, post-doctoral research fellowships, the annual Pembroke Seminar, and other academic programs. It also manages various collections, archives, and resources, including the Elizabeth Weed Feminist Theory Papers and the Christine Dunlap Farnham Archive.\n\n\n\n### The Graduate School[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brown University Graduate School\n\n![](image)Sayles Hall on the Main Green\nBrown introduced graduate courses in the 1870s and granted its first advanced degrees in 1888. The university established a Graduate Department in 1903 and a full Graduate School in 1927.[130]\n\n\nWith an enrollment of approximately 2,600 students, the school currently offers 33 and 51 master's and doctoral programs, respectively. The school additionally offers a number of fifth-year master's programs.[131] Overall, admission to the Graduate School is most competitive with an acceptance rate averaging at approximately 9 percent in recent years.\n\n\n\n### Carney Institute for Brain Science[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Carney Institute for Brain Science\n\nThe Robert J. & Nancy D. Carney Institute for Brain Science is Brown's cross-departmental neuroscience research institute. The institute's core focus areas include brain-computer interfaces and computational neuroscience; additional areas of focus include research into mechanisms of cell death with the interest of developing therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n\nThe Carney Institute was founded by John Donoghue in 2009 as the Brown Institute for Brain Science and renamed in 2018 in recognition of a $100 million gift.[132] The donation, one of the largest in the university's history, established the institute as one of the best-endowed university neuroscience programs in the country.[133]\n\n\n\n### Alpert Medical School[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Alpert Medical School\n\n![](image)The Alpert Medical School building on Richmond StreetEstablished in 1811, Brown's Alpert Medical School is the fourth oldest medical school in the Ivy League.[10][h]\n\n\nIn 1827, medical instruction was suspended by President Francis Wayland after the program's faculty declined to follow a new policy requiring students to live on campus. The program was reorganized in 1972; the first M.D. degrees from the new Program in Medicine were awarded to a graduating class of 58 students in 1975. In 1991, the school was officially renamed the Brown University School of Medicine, then renamed once more to Brown Medical School in October 2000.[134] In January 2007, entrepreneur and philanthropist Warren Alpert donated $100 million to the school. In recognition of the gift, the school's name was changed to the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.\n\n\nIn 2020, *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Brown's medical school the 9th most selective in the country, with an acceptance rate of 2.8%.[135] *U.S. News* ranks the school 38th for research and 35th for primary care.[136]\n\n\nBrown's medical school is known especially for its eight-year Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME), an eight-year combined baccalaureate-M.D. medical program. Inaugurated in 1984, the program is one of the most selective and renowned programs of its type in the country, offering admission to only 2% of applicants in 2021.[137]\n\n\nSince 1976, the Early Identification Program (EIP) has encouraged Rhode Island residents to pursue careers in medicine by recruiting sophomores from Providence College, Rhode Island College, the University of Rhode Island, and Tougaloo College. In 2004, the school once again began to accept applications from premedical students at other colleges and universities via AMCAS like most other medical schools. The medical school also offers M.D./PhD, M.D./M.P.H. and M.D./M.P.P. dual degree programs.\n\n\n\n### School of Public Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brown University School of Public Health\n\n![](image)The primary building of the Brown University School of Public Health viewed from across the Providence River\nBrown's School of Public Health grew out of the Alpert Medical School's Department of Community Health and was officially founded in 2013 as an independent school.[138][139] The school issues undergraduate (A.B., Sc.B.), graduate (M.P.H., Sc.M., A.M.), doctoral (Ph.D.), and dual-degrees (M.P.H./M.P.A., M.D./M.P.H.).[140]\n\n\n\n### Online programs[edit]\n\n\nThe Brown University School of Professional Studies currently offers blended learning Executive master's degrees in Healthcare Leadership, Cyber Security, and Science and Technology Leadership.[141] The master's degrees are designed to help students who have a job and life outside of academia to progress in their respective fields. The students meet in Providence every 6–7 weeks for a weekly seminar each trimester.\n\n\nThe university has also invested in MOOC development starting in 2013, when two courses, *Archeology's Dirty Little Secrets* and *The Fiction of Relationship*, both of which received thousands of students.[142] However, after a year of courses, the university broke its contract with Coursera and revamped its online persona and MOOC development department. By 2017, the university released new courses on edx, two of which were *The Ethics of Memory* and *Artful Medicine: Art's Power to Enrich Patient Care*. In January 2018, Brown published its first \"game-ified\" course called *Fantastic Places, Unhuman Humans: Exploring Humanity Through Literature*, which featured out-of-platform games to help learners understand materials, as well as a story-line that immerses users into a fictional world to help characters along their journey.[143]\n\n\n\n## Admissions and financial aid[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2021 enteringclass[144]Change vs.2016[145]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 4% (![Steady](image) +0.67)\n |\n| Yield rate | 62.05% (![Increase](image) +1.25)\n |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT EBRW | 750–780 |\n| SAT Math | 750–790 |\n| ACT Composite | 34–36 |\n| High school GPA[i] |\n| Top 10% | 95% (![Increase](image) +4.7)\n |\n| 1. **^** Among students whose school ranked\n |\n\n\n### Undergraduate[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admission to Brown University is considered \"most selective\" by *U.S. News & World Report.*[146] For the undergraduate class of 2026, Brown received 50,649 applications—the largest applicant pool in the university's history and a 9% increase from the prior year. Of these applicants, 2,560 were admitted for an acceptance rate of 5.0%, the lowest in the university's history.[147]\n\n\nIn 2021, the university reported a yield rate of 69%.[148] For the academic year 2019–20 the university received 2,030 transfer applications, of which 5.8% were accepted.[149]\n\n\nBrown's admissions policy is stipulated need-blind for all domestic first-year applicants.[150] In 2017, Brown announced that loans would be eliminated from all undergraduate financial aid awards starting in 2018–2019, as part of a new $30 million campaign called the *Brown Promise*.[151] In 2016–17, the university awarded need-based scholarships worth $120.5 million. The average need-based award for the class of 2020 was $47,940.[152]\n\n\n\n### Graduate[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, the Graduate School accepted 11% of 9,215 applicants.[153] In 2021, Brown received a record 948 applications for roughly 90 spots in its Master of Public Health Degree.[154]\n\n\nIn 2020, *U.S. News* ranked Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School the 9th most selective in the country, with an acceptance rate of 2.8 percent.[155]\n\n\n\n## Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[156] | 39 |\n| *Forbes*[157] | 15 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[158] | 9 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[159] | 40 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[160] | 6 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[161] | 98 |\n| *QS*[162] | 73 |\n| *THE*[163] | 64 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[164] | 129 |\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR graduate school rankings[165]\n |\n| --- |\n| Engineering\n | 53\n |\n| Medicine: Primary Care\n | 14\n |\n| Medicine: Research\n | 35\n |\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR departmental rankings[165]\n |\n| --- |\n| Biological Sciences\n | 37\n |\n| Biostatistics\n | 13\n |\n| Chemistry\n | 62\n |\n| Computer Science\n | 26\n |\n| Earth Sciences\n | 12\n |\n| Economics\n | 20\n |\n| English\n | 13\n |\n| History\n | 18\n |\n| Mathematics\n | 14\n |\n| Physics\n | 28\n |\n| Political Science\n | 41\n |\n| Psychology\n | 23\n |\n| Public Affairs\n | 62\n |\n| Public Health\n | 16\n |\n| Sociology\n | 20\n |\n\n\nBrown University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[166] For their 2021 rankings, The Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education ranked Brown 5th in the \"Best Colleges 2021\" edition.[167]\n\n\nThe *Forbes* magazine annual ranking of \"America's Top Colleges 2022\"—which ranked 600 research universities, liberal arts colleges and service academies—ranked Brown 19th overall and 18th among universities.[168]\n\n\n*U.S. News & World Report* ranked Brown 9th among national universities in its 2023 edition.[169] The 2022 edition also ranked Brown 2nd for undergraduate teaching, 25th in Most Innovative Schools, and 14th in Best Value Schools.[170]\n\n\n*Washington Monthly* ranked Brown 40th in 2022 among 442 national universities in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.[171]\n\n\nIn 2022, *U.S. News & World Report* ranks Brown 129th globally.\n\n\nIn 2014, *Forbes* magazine ranked Brown 7th on its list of \"America's Most Entrepreneurial Universities.\"[172] The *Forbes* analysis looked at the ratio of \"alumni and students who have identified themselves as founders and business owners on LinkedIn\" and the total number of alumni and students. LinkedIn particularized the *Forbes* rankings, placing Brown third (between MIT and Princeton) among \"Best Undergraduate Universities for Software Developers at Startups.\" LinkedIn's methodology involved a career-path examination of \"millions of alumni profiles\" in its membership database.[173]\n\n\nIn 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2021 the university produced the most Fulbright recipients of any university in the nation.[174][175][176] Brown has also produced the 7th most Rhodes Scholars of all colleges and universities in the United States.[177]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nBrown is a member of the Association of American Universities since 1933 and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity\".[178][179] In FY 2017, Brown spent $212.3 million on research and was ranked 103rd in the United States by total R&D expenditure by National Science Foundation.[180][181] In 2021 Brown's School of Public Health received the 4th most funding in NIH awards among schools of public health in the U.S.[182]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[183] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 42%\n | 42 |\n| Asian | 19%\n | 19 |\n| Hispanic | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Foreign national | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Other[i] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[j] | 13%\n | 13 |\n| Affluent[k] | 87%\n | 87 |\n\n\n### Campus safety[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Brown tied with the University of Connecticut for the highest number of reported rapes in the nation, with its \"total of reports of rape\" on their main campus standing at 43.[184] However, such rankings have been criticized for failing to account for how different campus environments can encourage or discourage individuals from reporting sexual assault cases, thereby affecting the number of reported rapes.[185]\n\n\n\n### Spring weekend[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spring Weekend\n\nEstablished in 1950, Spring Weekend is an annual spring music festival for students. Historical performers at the festival have included Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Bruce Springsteen, and U2. More recent headliners include Kendrick Lamar, Young Thug, Daniel Caesar, Anderson .Paak, Mitski, Aminé, and Mac DeMarco.[186][187][188][189] Since 1960, Spring Weekend has been organized by the student-run Brown Concert Agency.\n\n\n\n![](image)Many Spring Weekend events are hosted on Brown's Main Green.[190]\n### Residential and Greek societies[edit]\n\n\nApproximately 12 percent of Brown students participate in Greek Life.[191] The university recognizes thirteen active Greek organizations: six fraternities (Beta Omega Chi, Beta Rho Pi,[192][193] Delta Tau, Delta Phi, Kappa Alpha Psi, and Theta Alpha), five sororities (Alpha Chi Omega, Delta Sigma Theta, Delta Gamma, Kappa Delta, and Kappa Alpha Theta,), one co-ed house (Zeta Delta Xi), and one co-ed literary society (Alpha Delta Phi).[194] Other Greek-lettered organizations that have been historically active at Brown University include Alpha Kappa Alpha, Alpha Phi Alpha, and Lambda Upsilon Lambda.[195][196][197]\n\n\nSince the early 1950s, all Greek organizations on campus have been located in Wriston Quadrangle.[198] The organizations are overseen by the Greek Council.\n\n\nAn alternative to Greek-letter organizations are Brown's program houses, which are organized by themes. As with Greek houses, the residents of program houses select their new members, usually at the start of the spring semester. Examples of program houses are St. Anthony Hall (located in King House), Buxton International House, the Machado French/Hispanic/Latinx House, Technology House, Harambee (African culture) House, Social Action House and Interfaith House.\n\n\nAll students not in program housing enter a lottery for general housing. Students form groups and are assigned time slots during which they can pick among the remaining housing options.\n\n\n\n### Societies and clubs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ladd Observatory, built 1890–1891, is used by Brown Space Engineering, a student group focused on aerospace engineering.\nThe earliest societies at Brown were devoted to oration and debate. The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of Solomon Drowne, class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771.[11] The organization seems to have disappeared during the American Revolutionary War. Subsequent societies include the Misokosmian Society (est. 1798 and renamed the Philermenian Society), the Philandrian Society (est. 1799), the United Brothers (1806), the Philophysian Society (1818), and the Franklin Society (1824). Societies served social as well as academic purposes, with many supporting literary debate and amassing large libraries.[199][200] Older societies generally aligned with Federalists while younger societies generally leaned Republican.[11]\n\n\nSocieties remained popular into the 1860s, after which they were largely replaced by fraternities.[200]\n\n\nThe Cammarian Club was at first a semi-secret society that \"tapped\" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the club served as the *de facto* undergraduate student government. The organization was dissolved in 1971 and ultimately succeeded by a formal student government.\n\n\nSocietas Domi Pacificae, known colloquially as \"Pacifica House\", is a present-day, self-described secret society. It purports a continuous line of descent from the Franklin Society of 1824, citing a supposed intermediary \"Franklin Society\" traceable in the nineteenth century.\n\n\n\n### Student organizations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Brown University organizations\n\nThere are over 300 registered student organizations on campus with diverse interests. The Student Activities Fair, during the orientation program, provides first-year students the opportunity to become acquainted with a wide range of organizations. A sample of organizations includes:\n\n\n\n* *The Brown Daily Herald*\n* Brown Debating Union\n* The Brown Derbies\n* Brown International Organization\n* *Brown Journal of World Affairs*\n* *The Brown Jug*\n* *The Brown Noser*\n* *Brown Political Review*\n* *The Brown Spectator*\n* BSR\n* Brown University Band\n* Brown University Orchestra\n* Chinese Students and Scholars Association\n* *The College Hill Independent*\n* *Critical Review*\n* Ivy Film Festival\n* Jabberwocks\n* Production Workshop\n* Strait Talk\n* Starla and Sons\n* Students for Sensible Drug Policy\n* WBRU\n\n### LGBT[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, 38% of Brown's students identified as being LGBT, in a poll by *The Brown Daily Herald*.[201] The 2023 LGBT self-identification level was an increase, up from 14% LGBT identification in 2010.[201] \"Bisexual\" was the most common answer amongst LGBT respondents to the poll.[201]\n\n\n\n### Resource centers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sarah Doyle Women's Center\nBrown has several resource centers on campus. The centers often act as sources of support as well as safe spaces for students to explore certain aspects of their identity. Additionally, the centers often provide physical spaces for students to study and have meetings. Although most centers are identity-focused, some provide academic support as well.\n\n\nThe Brown Center for Students of Color (BCSC) is a space that provides support for students of color. Established in 1972 at the demand of student protests, the BCSC encourages students to engage in critical dialogue, develop leadership skills, and promote social justice.[202] The center houses various programs for students to share their knowledge and engage in discussion. Programs include the Third World Transition Program, the Minority Peer Counselor Program, the Heritage Series, and other student-led initiatives. Additionally, the BCSC hopes to foster community among the students it serves by providing spaces for students to meet and study.\n\n\nThe Sarah Doyle Women's Center aims to provide a space for members of the Brown community to examine and explore issues surrounding gender.[203] The center was named after one of the first women to attend Brown, Sarah Doyle. The center emphasizes intersectionality in its conversations on gender, encouraging people to see gender as present and relevant in various aspects of life. The center hosts programs and workshops in order to facilitate dialogue and provide resources for students, faculty, and staff.[204]\n\n\nOther centers include the LGBTQ Center, the Undocumented, First-Generation College and Low-Income Student (U-FLi) Center,[205] and the Curricular Resource Center.\n\n\n\n### Activism[edit]\n\n\n#### 1968 Black Student Walkout[edit]\n\n\nOn December 5, 1968, several Black women from Pembroke College initiated a walkout in protest of an atmosphere at the colleges described by Black students as a \"stifling, frustrating, [and] degrading place for Black students\" after feeling the colleges were non-responsive to their concerns. In total, 65 Black students participated in the walkout. Their principal demand was to increase Black student enrollment to 11% of the student populace, in an attempt to match that of the proportion in the US. This ultimately resulted in a 300% increase in Black enrollment the following year, but some demands have yet to be met.[206][207]\n\n\n\n#### Divestment from South Africa[edit]\n\n\nIn the mid-1980s, under student pressure, the university divested from certain companies involved in South Africa. Some students were still unsatisfied with partial divestment and began a fast in Manning Chapel and the university disenrolled them. In April 1987, \"dozens\" of students interrupted a university corporation meeting, leading to 20 being put on probation.[208]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brown Bears\n\n![](image)The 1879 Brown baseball varsity, with W.E. White seated second from right. White's appearance in an 1879 major league game may be the first person of color to play professional baseball, 68 years before Jackie Robinson.[209][210][211][212]\nBrown is a member of the Ivy League athletic conference, which is categorized as a Division I (top-level) conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\n\n\n\nThe Brown Bears has one of the largest university sports programs in the United States, sponsoring 32 varsity intercollegiate teams.[213] Brown's athletic program is one of the *U.S. News & World Report* top 20—the \"College Sports Honor Roll\"—based on breadth of the program and athletes' graduation rates. \n\nAthletic facilities\n![](image)\nBrown Stadium (opened 1925)\n![](image)\nNelson Fitness Center (opened 2012)\n![](image)\nMarston Boathouse, on the Seekonk River\n![](image)\nMeehan Auditorium (opened 1961)\n\nBrown's newest varsity team is women's rugby, promoted from club-sport status in 2014. Brown women's rowing has won 7 national titles between 1999 and 2011.[214] Brown men's rowing perennially finishes in the top 5 in the nation, most recently winning silver, bronze, and silver in the national championship races of 2012, 2013, and 2014. The men's and women's crews have also won championship trophies at the Henley Royal Regatta and the Henley Women's Regatta. Brown's men's soccer is consistently ranked in the top 20[215] and has won 18 Ivy League titles overall; recent[*when?*] soccer graduates play professionally in Major League Soccer and overseas.\n\n\nBrown football, under its most successful coach historically, Phil Estes, won Ivy League championships in 1999, 2005, and 2008. high-profile alumni of the football program include former Houston Texans head coach Bill O'Brien; former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno, Heisman Trophy namesake John W. Heisman, and Pollard Award namesake Fritz Pollard.\n\n\nBrown women's gymnastics won the Ivy League tournament in 2013 and 2014. The Brown women's sailing team has won 5 national championships, most recently in 2019[216] while the coed sailing team won 2 national championships in 1942 and 1948.[217] Both teams are consistency ranked in the top 10 in the nation.[218]\n\n\nThe first intercollegiate ice hockey game in America was played between Brown and Harvard on January 19, 1898.[219] The first university rowing regatta larger than a dual-meet was held between Brown, Harvard, and Yale at Lake Quinsigamond in Massachusetts on July 26, 1859.[220][11]\n\n\nBrown also supports competitive intercollegiate club sports, including ultimate frisbee. The men's ultimate team, Brownian Motion, has won three national championships, in 2000, 2005, and 2019.[221]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Brown University alumni\n\nAlumni in politics and government include U.S. Secretary of State John Hay (1852), U.S. Secretary of State and U.S. Attorney General Richard Olney (1856), Chief Justice of the United States and U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes (1881),Governor of Wyoming Territory and Nebraska Governor John Milton Thayer (1841), Rhode Island Governor Augustus Bourn (1855), Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal '92, U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan '80 of New Hampshire, Delaware Governor Jack Markell '82, Rhode Island Representative David Cicilline '83, Minnesota Representative Dean Phillips '91, 2020 Presidential candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang '96, DNC Chair Tom Perez '83, diplomat Richard Holbrooke '62, and diplomat W.

It is the seventh-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, founded in 1764 as the **College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations**. One of nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution,[6] it was the first college in the United States to codify in its charter that admission and instruction of students was to be equal regardless of their religious affiliation.[7]\n\n\nThe university is home to the oldest applied mathematics program in the United States, the oldest engineering program in the Ivy League, and the third-oldest medical program in New England.[a][8][9][10] It was one of the early doctoral-granting U.S. institutions in the late 19th century, adding masters and doctoral studies in 1887.[11] In 1969, it adopted its Open Curriculum after a period of student lobbying, which eliminated mandatory \"general education\" distribution requirements, made students \"the architects of their own syllabus\", and allowed them to take any course for a grade of satisfactory (Pass) or no-credit (Fail) which is unrecorded on external transcripts.[12][13] In 1971, Brown's coordinate women's institution, Pembroke College, was fully merged into the university.\n\n\nThe university comprises the College, the Graduate School, Alpert Medical School, the School of Engineering, the School of Public Health and the School of Professional Studies. Its international programs are organized through the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, and it is academically affiliated with the Marine Biological Laboratory and the Rhode Island School of Design; with the latter, it offers undergraduate and graduate dual degree programs.\n\n\nBrown's main campus is in the College Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island. The university is surrounded by a federally listed architectural district with a dense concentration of Colonial-era buildings. Benefit Street, which runs along the campus's western edge, has one of America's richest concentrations of 17th- and 18th-century architecture.[14][15] Brown's undergraduate admissions are among the most selective in the country, with an overall acceptance rate of 5% for the class of 2026.[16][17]\n\n\nAs of March 2022[update], 11 Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with Brown as alumni, faculty, or researchers, as well as 1 Fields Medalist, 7 National Humanities Medalists[b] and 11 National Medal of Science laureates. Other notable alumni include 27 Pulitzer Prize winners,[c] 21 billionaires,[d] 1 U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice, 4 U.S. Secretaries of State, over 100 members of the United States Congress,[24] 58 Rhodes Scholars,[25] 22 MacArthur Genius Fellows,[e] and 38 Olympic medalists.[26]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Brown University\n\n### Foundation and charter[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nPetitioner Ezra Stiles later became the seventh president of Yale College.\n![](image)\nPetitioner William Ellery signed the US Declaration of Independence in 1776.\n\nIn 1761, three residents of Newport, Rhode Island, drafted a petition to the colony's General Assembly:[27]\n\n\n\n\n> That your Petitioners propose to open a literary institution or School for instructing young Gentlemen in the Languages, Mathematics, Geography & History, & such other branches of Knowledge as shall be desired. That for this End... it will be necessary... to erect a public Building or Buildings for the boarding of the youth & the Residence of the Professors.\n> \n> \n\n\nThe three petitioners were Ezra Stiles, pastor of Newport's Second Congregational Church and future president of Yale University; William Ellery Jr., future signer of the United States Declaration of Independence; and Josias Lyndon, future governor of the colony. Stiles and Ellery later served as co-authors of the college's charter two years later. The editor of Stiles's papers observes, \"This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr. Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became Brown University.\"[27][28][11]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches was also interested in establishing a college in Rhode Island—home of the mother church of their denomination. At the time, the Baptists were unrepresented among the colonial colleges; the Congregationalists had Harvard and Yale, the Presbyterians had the College of New Jersey (later Princeton), and the Episcopalians had the College of William and Mary and King's College (later Columbia) while their local University of Pennsylvania was specifically founded without direct association with any particular denomination.[29] Isaac Backus, a historian of the New England Baptists and an inaugural trustee of Brown, wrote of the October 1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia:[11]\n\n\n\n\n> The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring them to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of the Baptists; ... Mr. James Manning, who took his first degree in New-Jersey college in September, 1762, was esteemed a suitable leader in this important work.\n> \n> \n\nJames Manning arrived at Newport in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who agreed to write the charter for the college. Stiles' first draft was read to the General Assembly in August 1763, and rejected by Baptist members who worried that their denomination would be underrepresented in the College Board of Fellows. A revised charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Rhode Island General Assembly on March 3, 1764, in East Greenwich.[30]\n\n\n![](image)\nBrown's first president, minister James Manning\n![](image)\nThe Ezra Stiles copy of Brown's 1764 charter\n\nIn September 1764, the inaugural meeting of the corporation—the college's governing body—was held in Newport's Old Colony House. Governor Stephen Hopkins was chosen chancellor, former and future governor Samuel Ward vice chancellor, John Tillinghast treasurer, and Thomas Eyres secretary. The charter stipulated that the board of trustees should be composed of 22 Baptists, five Quakers, five Episcopalians, and four Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, eight should be Baptists—including the college president—\"and the rest indifferently of any or all Denominations.\"[11]\n\n\nAt the time of its creation, Brown's charter was a uniquely progressive document.[31] Other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing doctrines, while Brown's charter asserted, \"Sectarian differences of opinions, shall not make any Part of the Public and Classical Instruction.\" The document additionally \"recognized more broadly and fundamentally than any other [university charter] the principle of denominational cooperation.\"[11] The oft-repeated statement that Brown's charter alone prohibited a religious test for College membership is inaccurate; other college charters were similarly liberal in that particular.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)This 1792 engraving is the first published image of Brown. University Hall stands on the right while the President's House sits on the left.\nThe college was founded as Rhode Island College, at the site of the First Baptist Church in Warren, Rhode Island.[33] Manning was sworn in as the college's first president in 1765 and remained in the role until 1791. In 1766, the college authorized the Reverend Morgan Edwards to travel to Europe to \"solicit Benefactions for this Institution\".[32] During his year-and-a-half stay in the British Isles, Edwards secured funding from benefactors including Thomas Penn and Benjamin Franklin.[32]\n\n\nIn 1770, the college moved from Warren to Providence. To establish a campus, John and Moses Brown purchased a four-acre lot on the crest of College Hill on behalf of the school. The majority of the property fell within the bounds of the original home lot of Chad Brown, an ancestor of the Browns and one of the original proprietors of Providence Plantations.[34] After the college was relocated to the city, work began on constructing its first building.\n\n\nA building committee, organized by the corporation, developed plans for the college's first purpose-built edifice, finalizing a design on February 9, 1770. The subsequent structure, referred to as \"The College Edifice\" and later as University Hall, may have been modeled on Nassau Hall, built 14 years prior at the College of New Jersey. President Manning, an active member of the building process, was educated at Princeton and might have suggested that Brown's first building resemble that of his alma mater.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Brown family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Following the gift of Nicholas Brown Jr. (Class of 1786), the university was renamed in his honor.\nNicholas Brown, John Brown, Joseph Brown, and Moses Brown were instrumental in moving the college to Providence, constructing its first building, and securing its endowment. Joseph became a professor of natural philosophy at the college; John served as its treasurer from 1775 to 1796; and Nicholas Sr's son Nicholas Brown Jr. succeeded his uncle as treasurer from 1796 to 1825.[36]\n\n\nOn September 8, 1803, the corporation voted, \"That the donation of $5,000, if made to this College within one Year from the late Commencement, shall entitle the donor to name the College.\" The following year, the appeal was answered by College Treasurer Nicholas Brown Jr. In a letter dated September 6, 1804, Brown committed \"a donation of Five Thousand Dollars to Rhode Island College, to remain in perpetuity as a fund for the establishment of a Professorship of Oratory and Belles Letters.\" In recognition of the gift, the corporation on the same day voted, \"That this College be called and known in all future time by the Name of Brown University.\"[37] Over the years, the benefactions of Nicholas Brown Jr., totaled nearly $160,000 and included funds for building Hope College (1821–22) and Manning Hall (1834–35).\n\n\nIn 1904, the John Carter Brown Library was established as an independently funded research library on Brown's campus; the library's collection was founded on that of John Carter Brown, son of Nicholas Brown Jr.\n\n\nThe Brown family was involved in various business ventures in Rhode Island, and accrued wealth both directly and indirectly from the transatlantic slave trade. The family was divided on the issue of slavery. John Brown had defended slavery, while Moses and Nicholas Brown Jr. were fervent abolitionists.\n\n\nIn 2003, under the tenure of President Ruth Simmons, the university established a steering committee to investigate these ties of the university to slavery and recommend a strategy to address them.[38]\n\n\n\n#### American Revolution[edit]\n\n\nWith British vessels patrolling Narragansett Bay in the fall of 1776, the college library was moved out of Providence for safekeeping. During the subsequent American Revolutionary War, Brown's University Hall was used to house French and other revolutionary troops led by General George Washington and the Comte de Rochambeau as they waited to commence the march of 1781 that led to the Siege of Yorktown and the Battle of the Chesapeake. This has been celebrated as marking the defeat of the British and the end of the war. The building functioned as barracks and hospital from December 10, 1776, to April 20, 1780, and as a hospital for French troops from June 26, 1780, to May 27, 1782.[11]\n\n\nA number of Brown's founders and alumni played roles in the American Revolution and subsequent founding of the United States. Brown's first chancellor, Stephen Hopkins, served as a delegate to the Colonial Congress in Albany in 1754, and to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776. James Manning represented Rhode Island at the Congress of the Confederation, while concurrently serving as Brown's first president.[39] Two of Brown's founders, William Ellery and Stephen Hopkins signed the Declaration of Independence.\n\n\nJames Mitchell Varnum, who graduated from Brown with honors in 1769, served as one of General George Washington's Continental Army brigadier generals and later as major general in command of the entire Rhode Island militia. Varnum is noted as the founder and commander of the 1st Rhode Island Regiment, widely regarded as the first Black battalion in U.S. military history.[40] David Howell, who graduated with an A.M. in 1769, served as a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1782 to 1785.\n\n\n\n### Presidents[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nBrown's 2nd President, Jonathan Maxcy, was the first alum to serve as president.\n![](image)\nBrown's 4th President, Francis Wayland, urged American universities to adopt a broader curriculum.\n![](image)\nBrown's 18th President, Ruth Simmons, was the Ivy League's first African-American president.\n![](image)\nBrown's 19th President, Christina Paxson, has served in the role since 2012.\nMain article: List of Presidents of Brown University\n\nNineteen individuals have served as presidents of the university since its founding in 1764. Since 2012, Christina Hull Paxson has served as president. Paxson had previously served as dean of Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs and chair of Princeton's economics department.[41] Paxson's immediate predecessor, Ruth Simmons, is noted as the first African American president of an Ivy League institution.[42] Other presidents of note include academic, Vartan Gregorian; and philosopher and economist, Francis Wayland.\n\n\n\n### New Curriculum[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Open Curriculum (Brown University)\n\nIn 1966, the first Group Independent Study Project (GISP) at Brown was formed, involving 80 students and 15 professors. The GISP was inspired by student-initiated experimental schools, especially San Francisco State College, and sought ways to \"put students at the center of their education\" and \"teach students how to think rather than just teaching facts\".[43]\n\n\nMembers of the GISP, Ira Magaziner and Elliot Maxwell published a paper of their findings titled, \"Draft of a Working Paper for Education at Brown University.\"[44][43] The paper made proposals for a new curriculum, including interdisciplinary freshman-year courses that would introduce \"modes of thought,\" with instruction from faculty from different disciplines as well as for an end to letter grades. The following year Magaziner began organizing the student body to press for the reforms, organizing discussions and protests.[45]\n\n\nIn 1968, university president Ray Heffner established a Special Committee on Curricular Philosophy. Composed of administrators, the committee was tasked with developing specific reforms and producing recommendations. A report, produced by the committee, was presented to the faculty, which voted the New Curriculum into existence on May 7, 1969. Its key features included:[46]\n\n\n\n* Modes of Thought courses for first-year students\n* The introduction of interdisciplinary courses\n* The abandonment of \"general education\" distribution requirements\n* The Satisfactory/No Credit (S/NC) grading option\n* The ABC/No Credit grading system, which eliminated pluses, minuses, and D's; a grade of \"No Credit\" (equivalent to F's at other institutions) would not appear on external transcripts.\n\n\nThe Modes of Thought course was discontinued early on, but the other elements remain in place. In 2006, the reintroduction of plus/minus grading was proposed in response to concerns regarding grade inflation. The idea was rejected by the College Curriculum Council after canvassing alumni, faculty, and students, including the original authors of the Magaziner-Maxwell Report.[47]\n\n\n\n### \"Slavery and Justice\" report[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Slavery Memorial* was designed by Martin Puryear and dedicated in 2014.\nIn 2003, then-university president Ruth Simmons launched a steering committee to research Brown's eighteenth-century ties to slavery. In October 2006, the committee released a report documenting its findings.[48][49]\n\n\nTitled \"Slavery and Justice\", the document detailed the ways in which the university benefited both directly and indirectly from the transatlantic slave trade and the labor of enslaved people. The report also included seven recommendations for how the university should address this legacy.[50] Brown has since completed a number of these recommendations including the establishment of its Center for the Study of Slavery and Justice, the construction of its *Slavery Memorial*, and the funding of a $10 million permanent endowment for Providence Public Schools.[50][51]\n\n\nThe Slavery and Justice report marked the first major effort by an American university to address its ties to slavery and prompted other institutions to undertake similar processes.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Coat of arms[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Coat of Arms of Brown University\n\nBrown's coat of arms was created in 1834. The prior year, president Francis Wayland had commissioned a committee to update the school's original seal to match the name the university had adopted in 1804. Central in the coat of arms is a white escutcheon divided into four sectors by a red cross. Within each sector of the coat of arms lies an open book. Above the shield is a crest consisting of the upper half of a sun in splendor among the clouds atop a red and white torse.[54]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nUniversity Hall, Brown's oldest building, was constructed in 1770 and is a National Historic Landmark\n![](image)\nSoldiers Memorial Gate (1921) long marked the eastern edge of Brown's campus.\n\nBrown is the largest institutional landowner in Providence, with properties on College Hill and in the Jewelry District.[55] The university was built contemporaneously with the eighteenth and nineteenth-century precincts surrounding it, making Brown's campus tightly integrated into Providence's urban fabric. Among the noted architects who have shaped Brown's campus are McKim, Mead & White, Philip Johnson, Rafael Viñoly, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and Robert A. M. Stern.[56]\n\n\n\n### Main campus[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Brown University buildings\nBrown's main campus, comprises 235 buildings and 143 acres (0.58 km2) in the East Side neighborhood of College Hill. The university's central campus sits on a 15-acre (6.1-hectare) block bounded by Waterman, Prospect, George, and Thayer Streets; newer buildings extend northward, eastward, and southward. Brown's core, historic campus, constructed primary between 1770 and 1926, is defined by three greens: the Front or Quiet Green, the Middle or College Green, and the Ruth J. Simmons Quadrangle (historically known as Lincoln Field).[57][58] A brick and wrought-iron fence punctuated by decorative gates and arches traces the block's perimeter. This section of campus is primarily Georgian and Richardsonian Romanesque in its architectural character.[57]\n\n\nTo the south of the central campus are academic buildings and residential quadrangles, including Wriston, Keeney, and Gregorian quadrangles. Immediately to the east of the campus core sit Sciences Park and Brown's School of Engineering. North of the central campus are performing and visual arts facilities, life sciences labs, and the Pembroke Campus, which houses both dormitories and academic buildings. Facing the western edge of the central campus sit two of the Brown's seven libraries, the John Hay Library and the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library.\n\n\nThe university's campus is contiguous with that of the Rhode Island School of Design, which is located immediately to Brown's west, along the slope of College Hill.\n\n\n\n#### Van Wickle Gates[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Van Wickle Gates\n\n![](image)The Van Wickle Gates stand at the crest of College Hill\nBuilt in 1901, the Van Wickle Gates are a set of wrought iron gates that stand at the western edge of Brown's campus. The larger main gate is flanked by two smaller side gates. At Convocation the central gate opens inward to admit the procession of new students; at Commencement, the gate opens outward for the procession of graduates.[59] A Brown superstition holds that students who walk through the central gate a second time prematurely will not graduate, although walking backward is said to cancel the hex.\n\n\n\n### John Hay Library[edit]\n\n\nMain article: John Hay Library\n\n![](image)The John Hay Library is home to rare books, special collections, and the university archives.The John Hay Library is the second oldest library on campus.[60] Opened in 1910, the library is named for John Hay (class of 1858), private secretary to Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State under William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. The construction of the building was funded in large part by Hay's friend, Andrew Carnegie, who contributed half of the $300,000 cost of construction.[61]\n\n\nThe John Hay Library serves as the repository of the university's archives, rare books and manuscripts, and special collections. Noteworthy among the latter are the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection[62] (described as \"the foremost American collection of material devoted to the history and iconography of soldiers and soldiering\"),[63] the Harris Collection of American Poetry and Plays (described as \"the largest and most comprehensive collection of its kind in any research library\"), the Lownes Collection of the History of Science (described as \"one of the three most important private collections of books of science in America\"), and the papers of H. P. Lovecraft. The Hay Library is home to one of the broadest collections of incunabula in the Americas, one of Brown's two Shakespeare First Folios, the manuscript of George Orwell's *Nineteen Eighty-Four,* and three books bound in human skin.[64]\n\n\n\n### John Carter Brown Library[edit]\n\n\nMain article: John Carter Brown Library\n\n![](image)The John Carter Brown Library is one of the world's leading repositories of books, maps, and manuscripts relating to the colonial Americas.[65]\nFounded in 1846, the John Carter Brown Library is generally regarded as the world's leading collection of primary historical sources relating to the exploration and colonization of the Americas. While administered and funded separately from the university, the library has been owned by Brown and located on its campus since 1904.[66]\n\n\nThe library contains the best preserved of the eleven surviving copies of the Bay Psalm Book—the earliest extant book printed in British North America and the most expensive printed book in the world.[67] Other holdings include a Shakespeare First Folio and the world's largest collection of 16th century Mexican texts.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)The galleries of Brown's anthropology museum, the Haffenreffer, are located in Manning Hall.\n### Haffenreffer Museum[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology\n\nThe exhibition galleries of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, Brown's teaching museum, are located in Manning Hall on the campus's main green. Its one million artifacts, available for research and educational purposes, are located at its Collections Research Center in Bristol, Rhode Island.[69] The museum's goal is to inspire creative and critical thinking about culture by fostering an interdisciplinary understanding of the material world. It provides opportunities for faculty and students to work with collections and the public, teaching through objects and programs in classrooms and exhibitions. The museum sponsors lectures and events in all areas of anthropology and also runs an extensive program of outreach to local schools.\n\n\n\n### Annmary Brown Memorial[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Annmary Brown Memorial\n\nThe Annmary Brown Memorial was constructed from 1903 to 1907 by the politician, Civil War veteran, and book collector General Rush Hawkins, as a mausoleum for his wife, Annmary Brown, a member of the Brown family. In addition to its crypt—the final repository for Brown and Hawkins—the Memorial includes works of art from Hawkins's private collection, including paintings by Angelica Kauffman, Peter Paul Rubens, Gilbert Stuart, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Benjamin West, and Eastman Johnson, among others. His collection of over 450 incunabula was relocated to the John Hay Library in 1990.[70] Today the Memorial is home to Brown's Medieval Studies and Renaissance Studies programs.\n\n\n\n### The Walk[edit]\n\n\nThe Walk, a landscaped pedestrian corridor, connects the Pembroke Campus to the main campus. It runs parallel to Thayer Street and serves as a primary axis of campus, extending from Ruth Simmons Quadrangle at its southern terminus to the Meeting Street entrance to the Pembroke Campus at its northern end.[71][72] The walk is bordered by departmental buildings as well as the Lindemann Performing Arts Center and Granoff Center for the Creative Arts\n\n\nThe corridor is home to public art including sculptures by Maya Lin and Tom Friedman.[73]\n\n\n\n### Pembroke campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Three dormitories, Metcalf Hall (1919), Andrews Hall (1947), and Miller Hall (1910), formed the heart of Pembroke College and now serve as freshman residences.\nThe Women's College in Brown University, known as Pembroke College, was founded in October 1891. Upon its 1971 merger with the College of Brown University, Pembroke's campus was absorbed into the larger Brown campus. The Pembroke campus is bordered by Meeting, Brown, Bowen, and Thayer Streets and sits three blocks north of Brown's central campus. The campus is dominated by brick architecture, largely of the Georgian and Victorian styles. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907), and Metcalf Hall (1919), while the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910). The quadrangle culminates on the north with Andrews Hall (1947).\n\n\nEast Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, originally served as the campus of Bryant University. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to relocate to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brown purchased their Providence campus for $5 million. The transaction expanded the Brown campus by 10 acres (40,000 m2) and 26 buildings. In 1971, Brown renamed the area East Campus.[74] Today, the area is largely used for dormitories.\n\n\nThayer Street runs through Brown's main campus. As a commercial corridor frequented by students, Thayer is comparable to Harvard Square or Berkeley's Telegraph Avenue. Wickenden Street, in the adjacent Fox Point neighborhood, is another commercial street similarly popular among students.\n\n\nBuilt in 1925, Brown Stadium—the home of the school's football team—is located approximately a mile and a half northeast of the university's central campus.[75] Marston Boathouse, the home of Brown's crew teams, lies on the Seekonk River, to the southeast of campus. Brown's sailing teams are based out of the Ted Turner Sailing Pavilion at the Edgewood Yacht Club in adjacent Cranston.\n\n\nSince 2011, Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School has been located in Providence's historic Jewelry District, near the medical campus of Brown's teaching hospitals, Rhode Island Hospital and the Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island. Other university facilities, including molecular medicine labs and administrative offices, are likewise located in the area.[76][77]\n\n\nBrown's School of Public Health occupies a landmark modernist building along the Providence River. Other Brown properties include the 376-acre (1.52 km2) Mount Hope Grant in Bristol, Rhode Island, an important Native American site noted as a location of King Philip's War. Brown's Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology Collection Research Center, particularly strong in Native American items, is located in the Mount Hope Grant.\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nBrown has committed to \"minimize its energy use, reduce negative environmental impacts, and promote environmental stewardship.\"[78] Since 2010, the university has required all new buildings meet LEED silver standards.[79] Between 2007 and 2018, Brown reduced its greenhouse emissions by 27 percent; the majority of this reduction is attributable to the university's Thermal Efficiency Project which converted its central heating plant from a steam-powered system to a hot water-powered system.[80]\n\n\nIn 2020, Brown announced it had sold 90 percent of its fossil fuel investments as part of a broader divestment from direct investments and managed funds that focus on fossil fuels.[81] In 2021, the university adopted the goal of reducing quantifiable campus emissions by 75 percent by 2025 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2040.[82] Brown is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions. [83]\n\n\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Brown would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (*104*) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (*25*).[84]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### The College[edit]\n\n\nMain article: College of Brown University\n\n![](image)Robinson Hall (1878) was designed by Walker and Gould in the Venetian Gothic style to house Brown's library.\nFounded in 1764, The College is Brown's oldest school. About 7,200 undergraduate students are enrolled in the college [*when?*], and 81 concentrations are offered. For the graduating class of 2020, the most popular concentrations were Computer Science, Economics, Biology, History, Applied Mathematics, International Relations, and Political Science. A quarter of Brown undergraduates complete more than one concentration before graduating.[85] If the existing programs do not align with their intended curricular interests, undergraduates may design and pursue independent concentrations.[86]\n\n\nAround 35 percent [*needs update*] of undergraduates pursue graduate or professional study immediately, 60 percent within 5 years, and 80 percent within 10 years.[87] For the Class of 2009, 56 percent of all undergraduate alumni have since earned graduate degrees. Among undergraduate alumni who go on to receive graduate degrees, the most common degrees earned are J.D. (16%), M.D. (14%), M.A. (14%), M.Sc. (14%), and Ph.D. (11%). The most common institutions from which undergraduate alumni earn graduate degrees are Brown University, Columbia University, and Harvard University.[88]\n\n\nThe highest fields of employment for undergraduate alumni ten years after graduation are education and higher education (15%), medicine (9%), business and finance (9%), law (8%), and computing and technology (7%).[88]\n\n\n\n### Brown and RISD[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The List Art Center, built 1969–71, designed by Philip Johnson, houses Brown's Department of Visual Art and the David Winton Bell Gallery.\nSince its 1893 relocation to College Hill, Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) has bordered Brown to its west. Since 1900, Brown and RISD students have been able to cross-register at the two institutions, with Brown students permitted to take as many as four courses at RISD to count towards their Brown degree.[89] The two institutions partner to provide various student-life services and the two student bodies compose a synergy in the College Hill cultural scene.\n\n\n\n#### Dual Degree Program[edit]\n\n\nAfter several years of discussion between the two institutions and several students pursuing dual degrees unofficially, Brown and RISD formally established a five-year dual degree program in 2007, with the first class matriculating in the fall of 2008.[90] The Brown|RISD Dual Degree Program, among the most selective in the country, offered admission to 20 of the 725 applicants for the class entering in autumn 2020, for an acceptance rate of 2.7%.[91] The program combines the complementary strengths of the two institutions, integrating studio art and design at RISD with Brown's academic offerings. Students are admitted to the Dual Degree Program for a course lasting five years and culminating in both the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree from Brown and the Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree from RISD. Prospective students must apply to the two schools separately and be accepted by separate admissions committees. Their application must then be approved by a third Brown|RISD joint committee.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Granoff Center, designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, hosts the annual Brown|RISD Dual Degree exhibition.\nAdmitted students spend the first year in residence at RISD completing its first-year Experimental and Foundation Studies curriculum while taking up to three Brown classes. Students spend their second year in residence at Brown, during which students take mainly Brown courses while starting on their RISD major requirements. In the third, fourth, and fifth years, students can elect to live at either school or off-campus, and course distribution is determined by the requirements of each student's unique combination of Brown concentration and RISD major. Program participants are noted for their creative and original approach to cross-disciplinary opportunities, combining, for example, industrial design with engineering, or anatomical illustration with human biology, or philosophy with sculpture, or architecture with urban studies. An annual \"BRDD Exhibition\" is a well-publicized and heavily attended event, drawing interest and attendees from the broader world of industry, design, the media, and the fine arts.\n\n\n\n#### MADE Program[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, the two schools announced the establishment of a new joint Master of Arts in Design Engineering program. Abbreviated as MADE, the program intends to combine RISD's programs in industrial design with Brown's programs in engineering. The program is administered through Brown's School of Engineering and RISD's Architecture and Design Division.[92]\n\n\n\n### Theatre and playwriting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lyman Hall, built 1890–92, houses the Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies.\nBrown's theatre and playwriting programs are among the best-regarded in the country.[93][94] Six Brown graduates have received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama; Alfred Uhry '58, Lynn Nottage '86, Ayad Akhtar '93, Nilo Cruz '94, Quiara Alegría Hudes '04, and Jackie Sibblies Drury MFA '04.[95] In *American Theater* magazine's 2009 ranking of the most-produced American plays, Brown graduates occupied four of the top five places—Peter Nachtrieb '97, Rachel Sheinkin '89, Sarah Ruhl '97, and Stephen Karam '02.[96][97]\n\n\n\nThe undergraduate concentration encompasses programs in theatre history, performance theory, playwriting, dramaturgy, acting, directing, dance, speech, and technical production. Applications for doctoral and master's degree programs are made through the University Graduate School. Master's degrees in acting and directing are pursued in conjunction with the Brown/Trinity Rep MFA program, which partners with the Trinity Repertory Company, a local regional theatre.[98]\n\n![](image)Aerial view of the Brown University English department\n### Writing programs[edit]\n\n\nWriting at Brown—fiction, non-fiction, poetry, playwriting, screenwriting, electronic writing, mixed media, and the undergraduate writing proficiency requirement—is catered for by various centers and degree programs, and a faculty that has long included nationally and internationally known authors. The undergraduate concentration in literary arts offers courses in fiction, poetry, screenwriting, literary hypermedia, and translation. Graduate programs include the fiction and poetry MFA writing programs in the literary arts department and the MFA playwriting program in the theatre arts and performance studies department. The non-fiction writing program is offered in the English department. Screenwriting and cinema narrativity courses are offered in the departments of literary arts and modern culture and media. The undergraduate writing proficiency requirement is supported by the Writing Center.\n\n\n\n#### Author prizewinners[edit]\n\n\nAlumni authors take their degrees across the spectrum of degree concentrations, but a gauge of the strength of writing at Brown is the number of major national writing prizes won. To note only winners since the year 2000: Pulitzer Prize for Fiction-winners Jeffrey Eugenides '82 (2003), Marilynne Robinson '66 (2005), and Andrew Sean Greer '92 (2018); British Orange Prize-winners Marilynne Robinson '66 (2009) and Madeline Miller '00 (2012); Pulitzer Prize for Drama-winners Nilo Cruz '94 (2003), Lynn Nottage '86 (twice, 2009, 2017), Quiara Alegría Hudes '04 (2012), Ayad Akhtar '93 (2013), and Jackie Sibblies Drury MFA '04 (2019); Pulitzer Prize for Biography-winners David Kertzer '69 (2015) and Benjamin Moser '98 (2020); Pulitzer Prize for Journalism-winners James Risen '77 (2006), Gareth Cook '91 (2005), Tony Horwitz '80 (1995), Usha Lee McFarling '89 (2007), David Rohde '90 (1996), Kathryn Schulz '96 (2016), and Alissa J. Rubin '80 (2016); Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction-winner James Forman Jr. '88 (2018); Pulitzer Prize for History-winner Marcia Chatelain PhD '08 (2021); Pulitzer Prize for Criticism-winner Salamishah Tillet MAT '97 (2022); and Pulitzer Prize for Poetry-winner Peter Balakian PhD '80 (2016)[99][100]\n\n\n\n### Computer science[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Brown Computing Laboratory, designed by Philip Johnson\nBrown began offering computer science courses through the departments of Economics and Applied Mathematics in 1956 when it acquired an IBM machine. Brown added an IBM 650 in January 1958, the only one of its type between Hartford and Boston. In 1960, Brown opened its first dedicated computer building. The facility, designed by Philip Johnson, received an IBM 7070 computer the following year. Brown granted computer sciences full Departmental status in 1979. In 2009, IBM and Brown announced the installation of a supercomputer (by teraflops standards), the most powerful in the southeastern New England region.[101]\n\n\nIn the 1960s, Andries van Dam along with Ted Nelson, and Bob Wallace invented The Hypertext Editing Systems, HES and FRESS while at Brown. Nelson coined the word *hypertext* while Van Dam's students helped originate XML, XSLT, and related Web standards. Among the school's computer science alumni are principal architect of the Classic Mac OS, Andy Hertzfeld; principal architect of the Intel 80386 and Intel 80486 microprocessors, John Crawford; former CEO of Apple, John Sculley; and digital effects programmer Masi Oka.[102][103] Other alumni include former CS department head at MIT, John Guttag, Workday founder, Aneel Bhusri, MongoDB founder Eliot Horowitz, Figma founders Dylan Field and Evan Wallace; and OpenSea founder Devin Finzer.[104]\n\n\nThe character \"Andy\" in the animated film *Toy Story* is purportedly an homage to professor Van Dam from his students employed at Pixar.[105]\n\n\nBetween 2012 and 2018, the number of concentrators in CS tripled.[106] In 2017, computer science overtook economics as the school's most popular undergraduate concentration.[107]\n\n\n\n### Applied mathematics[edit]\n\n\nBrown's program in applied mathematics was established in 1941 making it the oldest such program in the United States.[8][108] The division is highly ranked and regarded nationally and internationally.[109][110] Among the 67 recipients of the Timoshenko Medal, 22 have been affiliated with Brown's applied mathematics division as faculty, researchers, or students.[f]\n\n\n\n### The Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nGreek Revival Rhode Island Hall (1840) on the Main Green is home to the Joukowsky Institute.\n![](image)\nThe Department of Egyptology and Assyriology in Wilbour Hall (1888). Wilbour Hall is named for Egyptologist Charles Edwin Wilbour (class of 1854).\n\nMain article: Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World\n\nEstablished in 2004, the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World is Brown's interdisciplinary research center for archeology and ancient studies. The institute pursues fieldwork, excavations, regional surveys, and academic study of the archaeology and art of the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt, and Western Asia from the Levant to the Caucasus.[111] The institute has a very active fieldwork profile, with faculty-led excavations and regional surveys presently in Petra (Jordan), Abydos (Egypt), Turkey, Sudan, Italy, Mexico, Guatemala, Montserrat, and Providence.\n\n\nThe Joukowsky Institute's faculty includes cross-appointments from the departments of Egyptology, Assyriology, Classics, Anthropology, and History of Art and Architecture. Faculty research and publication areas include Greek and Roman art and architecture, landscape archaeology, urban and religious architecture of the Levant, Roman provincial studies, the Aegean Bronze Age, and the archaeology of the Caucasus. The institute offers visiting teaching appointments and postdoctoral fellowships which have, in recent years, included Near Eastern Archaeology and Art, Classical Archaeology and Art, Islamic Archaeology and Art, and Archaeology and Media Studies.\n\n\n**Egyptology and Assyriology**\n\n\nFacing the Joukowsky Institute, across the Front Green, is the Department of Egyptology and Assyriology, formed in 2006 by the merger of Brown's departments of Egyptology and History of Mathematics. It is one of only a handful of such departments in the United States.[112] The curricular focus is on three principal areas: Egyptology, Assyriology, and the history of the ancient exact sciences (astronomy, astrology, and mathematics). Many courses in the department are open to all Brown undergraduates without prerequisites and include archaeology, languages, history, and Egyptian and Mesopotamian religions, literature, and science. Students concentrating in the department choose a track of either Egyptology or Assyriology. Graduate-level study comprises three tracks to the doctoral degree: Egyptology, Assyriology, or the History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity.\n\n\n\n### The Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs\n![](image)\nThe main building at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs was designed by Rafael Viñoly in 2001\n![](image)\nStephen Robert Hall (2018) at the Watson Institute, was designed by Toshiko Mori\n\nThe Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, Brown's center for the study of global Issues and public affairs, is one of the leading institutes of its type in the country. The institute occupies facilities designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael Viñoly and Japanese architect Toshiko Mori. The institute was initially endowed by Thomas Watson Jr. (Class of 1937), former Ambassador to the Soviet Union and longtime president of IBM.\n\n\nInstitute faculty and faculty emeritus include Italian prime minister and European Commission president Romano Prodi,[113] Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso,[114] Chilean president Ricardo Lagos Escobar,[115] Mexican novelist and statesman Carlos Fuentes,[116] Brazilian statesman and United Nations commission head Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro,[117] Indian foreign minister and ambassador to the United States Nirupama Rao,[118] American diplomat and Dayton Peace Accords author Richard Holbrooke (Class of 1962),[119] and Sergei Khrushchev,[120] editor of the papers of his father Nikita Khrushchev, leader of the Soviet Union.\n\n\nThe institute's curricular interest is organized into the principal themes of development, security, and governance—with further focuses on globalization, economic uncertainty, security threats, environmental degradation, and poverty. Six Brown undergraduate concentrations are hosted by the Watson Institute: Development Studies, International and Public Affairs, International Relations, Latin American and Caribbean Studies, Middle East Studies, Public Policy, and South Asian Studies. Graduate programs offered at the Watson Institute include the Graduate Program in Development (Ph.D.) and the Master of Public Affairs (M.P.A) Program. The institute also offers postdoctoral, professional development, and global outreach programming. In support of these programs, the institute houses various centers, including the Brazil Initiative, Brown-India Initiative, China Initiative, Middle East Studies Center, The Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS), and the Taubman Center for Public Policy. In recent years, the most internationally cited product of the Watson Institute has been its Costs of War Project, first released in 2011 and continuously updated since. The project comprises a team of economists, anthropologists, political scientists, legal experts, and physicians, and seeks to calculate the economic costs, human casualties, and impact on civil liberties of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan since 2001.[121]\n\n\n\n### The School of Engineering[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brown University School of Engineering\n\n![](image)The Brown University Engineering Research Center, completed in 2018 and designed by KieranTimberlake[122]\nEstablished in 1847, Brown's engineering program is the oldest in the Ivy League and the third oldest civilian engineering program in the country.[g] In 1916, Brown's departments of electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering were merged into a single Division of Engineering. In 2010 the division was elevated to a School of Engineering.[123]\n\n\nEngineering at Brown is especially interdisciplinary. The school is organized without the traditional departments or boundaries found at most schools and follows a model of connectivity between disciplines—including biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, the humanities, and the social sciences. The school practices an innovative clustering of faculties in which engineers team with non-engineers to bring a convergence of ideas.\n\n\nStudent teams have launched two CubeSats with the support of the School of Engineering. Brown Space Engineering developed EQUiSat a 1U satellite, and another interdisciplinary team developed SBUDNIC a 3U satellite.[124][125]\n\n\n\n### IE Brown Executive MBA Dual Degree Program[edit]\n\n\nSince 2009, Brown has developed an Executive MBA program in conjunction with one of the leading Business Schools in Europe, IE Business School in Madrid. This relationship has since strengthened resulting in both institutions offering a dual degree program.[126] In this partnership, Brown provides its traditional coursework while IE provides most of the business-related subjects making a differentiated alternative program to other Ivy League's EMBAs.[127] The cohort typically consists of 25–30 EMBA candidates from some 20 countries.[128] Classes are held in Providence, Madrid, Cape Town and Online.\n\n\n\n![](image)Pembroke Hall (1897) houses the administrative offices of the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women.\n### The Pembroke Center[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women\n\nThe Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women was established at Brown in 1981 by Joan Wallach Scott as an interdisciplinary research center on gender.[129] The center is named for Pembroke College, Brown's former women's college, and is affiliated with Brown's Sarah Doyle Women's Center. The Pembroke Center supports Brown's undergraduate concentration in Gender and Sexuality Studies, post-doctoral research fellowships, the annual Pembroke Seminar, and other academic programs. It also manages various collections, archives, and resources, including the Elizabeth Weed Feminist Theory Papers and the Christine Dunlap Farnham Archive.\n\n\n\n### The Graduate School[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brown University Graduate School\n\n![](image)Sayles Hall on the Main Green\nBrown introduced graduate courses in the 1870s and granted its first advanced degrees in 1888. The university established a Graduate Department in 1903 and a full Graduate School in 1927.[130]\n\n\nWith an enrollment of approximately 2,600 students, the school currently offers 33 and 51 master's and doctoral programs, respectively. The school additionally offers a number of fifth-year master's programs.[131] Overall, admission to the Graduate School is most competitive with an acceptance rate averaging at approximately 9 percent in recent years.\n\n\n\n### Carney Institute for Brain Science[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Carney Institute for Brain Science\n\nThe Robert J. & Nancy D. Carney Institute for Brain Science is Brown's cross-departmental neuroscience research institute. The institute's core focus areas include brain-computer interfaces and computational neuroscience; additional areas of focus include research into mechanisms of cell death with the interest of developing therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n\nThe Carney Institute was founded by John Donoghue in 2009 as the Brown Institute for Brain Science and renamed in 2018 in recognition of a $100 million gift.[132] The donation, one of the largest in the university's history, established the institute as one of the best-endowed university neuroscience programs in the country.[133]\n\n\n\n### Alpert Medical School[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Alpert Medical School\n\n![](image)The Alpert Medical School building on Richmond StreetEstablished in 1811, Brown's Alpert Medical School is the fourth oldest medical school in the Ivy League.[10][h]\n\n\nIn 1827, medical instruction was suspended by President Francis Wayland after the program's faculty declined to follow a new policy requiring students to live on campus. The program was reorganized in 1972; the first M.D. degrees from the new Program in Medicine were awarded to a graduating class of 58 students in 1975. In 1991, the school was officially renamed the Brown University School of Medicine, then renamed once more to Brown Medical School in October 2000.[134] In January 2007, entrepreneur and philanthropist Warren Alpert donated $100 million to the school. In recognition of the gift, the school's name was changed to the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.\n\n\nIn 2020, *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Brown's medical school the 9th most selective in the country, with an acceptance rate of 2.8%.[135] *U.S. News* ranks the school 38th for research and 35th for primary care.[136]\n\n\nBrown's medical school is known especially for its eight-year Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME), an eight-year combined baccalaureate-M.D. medical program. Inaugurated in 1984, the program is one of the most selective and renowned programs of its type in the country, offering admission to only 2% of applicants in 2021.[137]\n\n\nSince 1976, the Early Identification Program (EIP) has encouraged Rhode Island residents to pursue careers in medicine by recruiting sophomores from Providence College, Rhode Island College, the University of Rhode Island, and Tougaloo College. In 2004, the school once again began to accept applications from premedical students at other colleges and universities via AMCAS like most other medical schools. The medical school also offers M.D./PhD, M.D./M.P.H. and M.D./M.P.P. dual degree programs.\n\n\n\n### School of Public Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brown University School of Public Health\n\n![](image)The primary building of the Brown University School of Public Health viewed from across the Providence River\nBrown's School of Public Health grew out of the Alpert Medical School's Department of Community Health and was officially founded in 2013 as an independent school.[138][139] The school issues undergraduate (A.B., Sc.B.), graduate (M.P.H., Sc.M., A.M.), doctoral (Ph.D.), and dual-degrees (M.P.H./M.P.A., M.D./M.P.H.).[140]\n\n\n\n### Online programs[edit]\n\n\nThe Brown University School of Professional Studies currently offers blended learning Executive master's degrees in Healthcare Leadership, Cyber Security, and Science and Technology Leadership.[141] The master's degrees are designed to help students who have a job and life outside of academia to progress in their respective fields. The students meet in Providence every 6–7 weeks for a weekly seminar each trimester.\n\n\nThe university has also invested in MOOC development starting in 2013, when two courses, *Archeology's Dirty Little Secrets* and *The Fiction of Relationship*, both of which received thousands of students.[142] However, after a year of courses, the university broke its contract with Coursera and revamped its online persona and MOOC development department. By 2017, the university released new courses on edx, two of which were *The Ethics of Memory* and *Artful Medicine: Art's Power to Enrich Patient Care*. In January 2018, Brown published its first \"game-ified\" course called *Fantastic Places, Unhuman Humans: Exploring Humanity Through Literature*, which featured out-of-platform games to help learners understand materials, as well as a story-line that immerses users into a fictional world to help characters along their journey.[143]\n\n\n\n## Admissions and financial aid[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2021 enteringclass[144]Change vs.2016[145]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 4% (![Steady](image) +0.67)\n |\n| Yield rate | 62.05% (![Increase](image) +1.25)\n |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT EBRW | 750–780 |\n| SAT Math | 750–790 |\n| ACT Composite | 34–36 |\n| High school GPA[i] |\n| Top 10% | 95% (![Increase](image) +4.7)\n |\n| 1. **^** Among students whose school ranked\n |\n\n\n### Undergraduate[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admission to Brown University is considered \"most selective\" by *U.S. News & World Report.*[146] For the undergraduate class of 2026, Brown received 50,649 applications—the largest applicant pool in the university's history and a 9% increase from the prior year. Of these applicants, 2,560 were admitted for an acceptance rate of 5.0%, the lowest in the university's history.[147]\n\n\nIn 2021, the university reported a yield rate of 69%.[148] For the academic year 2019–20 the university received 2,030 transfer applications, of which 5.8% were accepted.[149]\n\n\nBrown's admissions policy is stipulated need-blind for all domestic first-year applicants.[150] In 2017, Brown announced that loans would be eliminated from all undergraduate financial aid awards starting in 2018–2019, as part of a new $30 million campaign called the *Brown Promise*.[151] In 2016–17, the university awarded need-based scholarships worth $120.5 million. The average need-based award for the class of 2020 was $47,940.[152]\n\n\n\n### Graduate[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, the Graduate School accepted 11% of 9,215 applicants.[153] In 2021, Brown received a record 948 applications for roughly 90 spots in its Master of Public Health Degree.[154]\n\n\nIn 2020, *U.S. News* ranked Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School the 9th most selective in the country, with an acceptance rate of 2.8 percent.[155]\n\n\n\n## Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[156] | 39 |\n| *Forbes*[157] | 15 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[158] | 9 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[159] | 40 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[160] | 6 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[161] | 98 |\n| *QS*[162] | 73 |\n| *THE*[163] | 64 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[164] | 129 |\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR graduate school rankings[165]\n |\n| --- |\n| Engineering\n | 53\n |\n| Medicine: Primary Care\n | 14\n |\n| Medicine: Research\n | 35\n |\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR departmental rankings[165]\n |\n| --- |\n| Biological Sciences\n | 37\n |\n| Biostatistics\n | 13\n |\n| Chemistry\n | 62\n |\n| Computer Science\n | 26\n |\n| Earth Sciences\n | 12\n |\n| Economics\n | 20\n |\n| English\n | 13\n |\n| History\n | 18\n |\n| Mathematics\n | 14\n |\n| Physics\n | 28\n |\n| Political Science\n | 41\n |\n| Psychology\n | 23\n |\n| Public Affairs\n | 62\n |\n| Public Health\n | 16\n |\n| Sociology\n | 20\n |\n\n\nBrown University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[166] For their 2021 rankings, The Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education ranked Brown 5th in the \"Best Colleges 2021\" edition.[167]\n\n\nThe *Forbes* magazine annual ranking of \"America's Top Colleges 2022\"—which ranked 600 research universities, liberal arts colleges and service academies—ranked Brown 19th overall and 18th among universities.[168]\n\n\n*U.S. News & World Report* ranked Brown 9th among national universities in its 2023 edition.[169] The 2022 edition also ranked Brown 2nd for undergraduate teaching, 25th in Most Innovative Schools, and 14th in Best Value Schools.[170]\n\n\n*Washington Monthly* ranked Brown 40th in 2022 among 442 national universities in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.[171]\n\n\nIn 2022, *U.S. News & World Report* ranks Brown 129th globally.\n\n\nIn 2014, *Forbes* magazine ranked Brown 7th on its list of \"America's Most Entrepreneurial Universities.\"[172] The *Forbes* analysis looked at the ratio of \"alumni and students who have identified themselves as founders and business owners on LinkedIn\" and the total number of alumni and students. LinkedIn particularized the *Forbes* rankings, placing Brown third (between MIT and Princeton) among \"Best Undergraduate Universities for Software Developers at Startups.\" LinkedIn's methodology involved a career-path examination of \"millions of alumni profiles\" in its membership database.[173]\n\n\nIn 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2021 the university produced the most Fulbright recipients of any university in the nation.[174][175][176] Brown has also produced the 7th most Rhodes Scholars of all colleges and universities in the United States.[177]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nBrown is a member of the Association of American Universities since 1933 and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity\".[178][179] In FY 2017, Brown spent $212.3 million on research and was ranked 103rd in the United States by total R&D expenditure by National Science Foundation.[180][181] In 2021 Brown's School of Public Health received the 4th most funding in NIH awards among schools of public health in the U.S.[182]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[183] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 42%\n | 42 |\n| Asian | 19%\n | 19 |\n| Hispanic | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Foreign national | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Other[i] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[j] | 13%\n | 13 |\n| Affluent[k] | 87%\n | 87 |\n\n\n### Campus safety[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Brown tied with the University of Connecticut for the highest number of reported rapes in the nation, with its \"total of reports of rape\" on their main campus standing at 43.[184] However, such rankings have been criticized for failing to account for how different campus environments can encourage or discourage individuals from reporting sexual assault cases, thereby affecting the number of reported rapes.[185]\n\n\n\n### Spring weekend[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spring Weekend\n\nEstablished in 1950, Spring Weekend is an annual spring music festival for students. Historical performers at the festival have included Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Bruce Springsteen, and U2. More recent headliners include Kendrick Lamar, Young Thug, Daniel Caesar, Anderson .Paak, Mitski, Aminé, and Mac DeMarco.[186][187][188][189] Since 1960, Spring Weekend has been organized by the student-run Brown Concert Agency.\n\n\n\n![](image)Many Spring Weekend events are hosted on Brown's Main Green.[190]\n### Residential and Greek societies[edit]\n\n\nApproximately 12 percent of Brown students participate in Greek Life.[191] The university recognizes thirteen active Greek organizations: six fraternities (Beta Omega Chi, Beta Rho Pi,[192][193] Delta Tau, Delta Phi, Kappa Alpha Psi, and Theta Alpha), five sororities (Alpha Chi Omega, Delta Sigma Theta, Delta Gamma, Kappa Delta, and Kappa Alpha Theta,), one co-ed house (Zeta Delta Xi), and one co-ed literary society (Alpha Delta Phi).[194] Other Greek-lettered organizations that have been historically active at Brown University include Alpha Kappa Alpha, Alpha Phi Alpha, and Lambda Upsilon Lambda.[195][196][197]\n\n\nSince the early 1950s, all Greek organizations on campus have been located in Wriston Quadrangle.[198] The organizations are overseen by the Greek Council.\n\n\nAn alternative to Greek-letter organizations are Brown's program houses, which are organized by themes. As with Greek houses, the residents of program houses select their new members, usually at the start of the spring semester. Examples of program houses are St. Anthony Hall (located in King House), Buxton International House, the Machado French/Hispanic/Latinx House, Technology House, Harambee (African culture) House, Social Action House and Interfaith House.\n\n\nAll students not in program housing enter a lottery for general housing. Students form groups and are assigned time slots during which they can pick among the remaining housing options.\n\n\n\n### Societies and clubs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ladd Observatory, built 1890–1891, is used by Brown Space Engineering, a student group focused on aerospace engineering.\nThe earliest societies at Brown were devoted to oration and debate. The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of Solomon Drowne, class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771.[11] The organization seems to have disappeared during the American Revolutionary War. Subsequent societies include the Misokosmian Society (est. 1798 and renamed the Philermenian Society), the Philandrian Society (est. 1799), the United Brothers (1806), the Philophysian Society (1818), and the Franklin Society (1824). Societies served social as well as academic purposes, with many supporting literary debate and amassing large libraries.[199][200] Older societies generally aligned with Federalists while younger societies generally leaned Republican.[11]\n\n\nSocieties remained popular into the 1860s, after which they were largely replaced by fraternities.[200]\n\n\nThe Cammarian Club was at first a semi-secret society that \"tapped\" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the club served as the *de facto* undergraduate student government. The organization was dissolved in 1971 and ultimately succeeded by a formal student government.\n\n\nSocietas Domi Pacificae, known colloquially as \"Pacifica House\", is a present-day, self-described secret society. It purports a continuous line of descent from the Franklin Society of 1824, citing a supposed intermediary \"Franklin Society\" traceable in the nineteenth century.\n\n\n\n### Student organizations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Brown University organizations\n\nThere are over 300 registered student organizations on campus with diverse interests. The Student Activities Fair, during the orientation program, provides first-year students the opportunity to become acquainted with a wide range of organizations. A sample of organizations includes:\n\n\n\n* *The Brown Daily Herald*\n* Brown Debating Union\n* The Brown Derbies\n* Brown International Organization\n* *Brown Journal of World Affairs*\n* *The Brown Jug*\n* *The Brown Noser*\n* *Brown Political Review*\n* *The Brown Spectator*\n* BSR\n* Brown University Band\n* Brown University Orchestra\n* Chinese Students and Scholars Association\n* *The College Hill Independent*\n* *Critical Review*\n* Ivy Film Festival\n* Jabberwocks\n* Production Workshop\n* Strait Talk\n* Starla and Sons\n* Students for Sensible Drug Policy\n* WBRU\n\n### LGBT[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, 38% of Brown's students identified as being LGBT, in a poll by *The Brown Daily Herald*.[201] The 2023 LGBT self-identification level was an increase, up from 14% LGBT identification in 2010.[201] \"Bisexual\" was the most common answer amongst LGBT respondents to the poll.[201]\n\n\n\n### Resource centers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sarah Doyle Women's Center\nBrown has several resource centers on campus. The centers often act as sources of support as well as safe spaces for students to explore certain aspects of their identity. Additionally, the centers often provide physical spaces for students to study and have meetings. Although most centers are identity-focused, some provide academic support as well.\n\n\nThe Brown Center for Students of Color (BCSC) is a space that provides support for students of color. Established in 1972 at the demand of student protests, the BCSC encourages students to engage in critical dialogue, develop leadership skills, and promote social justice.[202] The center houses various programs for students to share their knowledge and engage in discussion. Programs include the Third World Transition Program, the Minority Peer Counselor Program, the Heritage Series, and other student-led initiatives. Additionally, the BCSC hopes to foster community among the students it serves by providing spaces for students to meet and study.\n\n\nThe Sarah Doyle Women's Center aims to provide a space for members of the Brown community to examine and explore issues surrounding gender.[203] The center was named after one of the first women to attend Brown, Sarah Doyle. The center emphasizes intersectionality in its conversations on gender, encouraging people to see gender as present and relevant in various aspects of life. The center hosts programs and workshops in order to facilitate dialogue and provide resources for students, faculty, and staff.[204]\n\n\nOther centers include the LGBTQ Center, the Undocumented, First-Generation College and Low-Income Student (U-FLi) Center,[205] and the Curricular Resource Center.\n\n\n\n### Activism[edit]\n\n\n#### 1968 Black Student Walkout[edit]\n\n\nOn December 5, 1968, several Black women from Pembroke College initiated a walkout in protest of an atmosphere at the colleges described by Black students as a \"stifling, frustrating, [and] degrading place for Black students\" after feeling the colleges were non-responsive to their concerns. In total, 65 Black students participated in the walkout. Their principal demand was to increase Black student enrollment to 11% of the student populace, in an attempt to match that of the proportion in the US. This ultimately resulted in a 300% increase in Black enrollment the following year, but some demands have yet to be met.[206][207]\n\n\n\n#### Divestment from South Africa[edit]\n\n\nIn the mid-1980s, under student pressure, the university divested from certain companies involved in South Africa. Some students were still unsatisfied with partial divestment and began a fast in Manning Chapel and the university disenrolled them. In April 1987, \"dozens\" of students interrupted a university corporation meeting, leading to 20 being put on probation.[208]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brown Bears\n\n![](image)The 1879 Brown baseball varsity, with W.E.

The university was founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White. Since its founding, Cornell has been a co-educational, non-sectarian institution where admission has not been restricted by religion or race. The student body for the fall 2022 semester consisted of more than 15,000 undergraduate and 7,000 graduate students from all 50 American states and 130 countries.[4]\n\n\nThe university is organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus[9] with each college and division defining its specific admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university also administers three satellite campuses, including two in New York City and one in the Education City region of Qatar.[9]\n\n\nCornell is one of the few private land grant universities in the United States.[a] Of its seven undergraduate colleges, three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State University of New York system, including its agricultural and human ecology colleges and its industrial labor relations school. Among Cornell's graduate schools, only the veterinary college is state-supported. The main campus of Cornell University in Ithaca spans 745 acres (301 ha).\n\n\nAs of October 2023,[update] there have been 62 Nobel laureates, 4 Turing Award winners, and 1 Fields Medalist affiliated with Cornell. Cornell counts more than 250,000 living alumni and its former and present faculty and alumni include 34 Marshall Scholars,[10] 33 Rhodes Scholars, 29 Truman Scholars, 7 Gates Scholars, 63 Olympic Medalists, 10 current Fortune 500 CEOs, and 35 billionaire alumni.[11][12][13][14][15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Cornell University\n\nCornell's founders\n![](image)\nEzra Cornell\n![](image)\nAndrew Dickson White\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFile:Cornell+University.jpgMcGraw Tower with Uris Library, Morrill Hall, and Cayuga Lake visible\nCornell University was founded on April 27, 1865, by Ezra Cornell, an entrepreneur and New York State Senator, and Andrew Dickson White, an educator and fellow New York State Senator, after the New York State legislature authorized the university as the state's land grant institution.[16] Ezra Cornell offered his farm in Ithaca, New York as a preliminary site for the university along with $500,000 of his personal fortune as an initial endowment (equivalent to $12,373,000 in 2023), and White agreed to be Cornell University's first president.\n\n\nDuring Cornell University's first three years, White oversaw the construction of the first two buildings and traveled to attract students and faculty.[17] The university was inaugurated on October 7, 1868, and 412 men were enrolled the next day.[18]\n\n\nCornell developed as a technologically innovative institution, applying its research to its own campus and to outreach efforts. In 1883, it was one of the first university campuses to use electricity from a water-powered dynamo to light the campus grounds.[19] Since 1894, Cornell has included colleges that are state funded and fulfill statutory requirements;[20] it has also administered research and extension activities that have been jointly funded by New York state along with federal government matching programs.[21]\n\n\nCornell has had active alumni since its earliest classes. It was one of the first universities to include alumni-elected representatives on its board of trustees.[b]\n\n\nCornell is home to the Cornell University Press, founded in 1869, the country's oldest publishing enterprise. Cornell was first home to the Cornell Era, a weekly campus publication founded in 1868. But the Cornell Daily Sun, an independent student-run newspaper founded in 1880 became the school's leading publication. Today, the Sun is the oldest continuously independent college daily in the United States.\n\n\nIn the 19th century, Cornell was also home to numerous literary societies, founded to encourage writing, reading, and oration skills. The U.S. Bureau of Education described three of them as a \"purely literary society\" following the \"traditions of the old literary societies of Eastern universities. These societies largely disappeared by the 20th century.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nCornell was among the Ivies that experienced heightened student activism during the 1960s, related to cultural issues, civil rights, and opposition to the Vietnam War. Protests and occupations resulted in the resignation of Cornell's president and the restructuring of university governance.[25]\n\n\nIn 1967, Cornell experienced a fire in the Residential Club dormitory that killed eight students and one professor.\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar\n\nSince 2000, Cornell has been expanding its international programs. In 2004, the university opened the Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar.[26] It has partnerships with institutions in India, Singapore, and the People's Republic of China.[27][28][29] The former president, Jeffrey S. Lehman, described the university, with its high international profile, as a \"transnational university\".[30] On March 9, 2004, Cornell and Stanford University laid the cornerstone for a new 'Bridging the Rift Center' to be built and jointly operated for education on the Israel–Jordan border.[31]\n\n\n\nA graduate student group, At What Cost?, formed at Cornell in August 2002 to oppose a graduate student unionization drive run by an organization called CASE/UAW that was affiliated with the United Auto Workers. The unionization vote was held October 23–24, 2002, and the union was rejected. At What Cost? was considered instrumental in the unusually large 90% turnout for the vote and in the 2-to-1 defeat of the unionization proposal. There had been no prior instance in American graduate student unionization history where a unionization proposal was defeated by a vote.[32][33][34]\n\n\nCornell also opened a graduate campus and research center on Roosevelt Island, Manhattan, New York City.\n\n\nThe university offers over 4,000 courses as of 2023.[35]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Arts Quad on Cornell's main campus with McGraw Tower in the background\n![](image)Ho Plaza seen from McGraw Tower with Sage Hall and Barnes Hall in the background\n![](image)Sage Chapel on the Cornell campus hosts religious services and concerts and is the final resting place of Ezra Cornell, the university's founder\n### Ithaca campus[edit]\n\n\nCornell University's main campus is located in Ithaca, New York, on East Hill, offering views of the city and Cayuga Lake. The campus has expanded to approximately 745 acres (301 ha) since its founding, comprising academic buildings, laboratories, administrative facilities, athletic centers, auditoriums, museums, and residential areas.[36][37] In 2011, *Travel+Leisure* recognized the Ithaca Campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States, praising its unique blend of architectural styles, historic landmarks, and picturesque surroundings.[38]\n\n\nThe Ithaca campus is characterized by an irregular layout and a mix of architectural styles, which have developed over time due to the university's ever-changing master plans for the campus. The more ornate buildings generally predate World War II, while the student population doubled from 7,000 in 1950 to 15,000 by 1970, leading to modernist architectural styles becoming more prevalent.[39]\n\n\nSeveral university buildings are listed as historic landmarks,[40] highlighting the architectural and historical significance of the campus. Those listed on the National Register of Historic Places include the Andrew Dickson White House, Bailey Hall, Caldwell Hall, the Computing and Communications Center, Morrill Hall, Rice Hall, Fernow Hall, Wing Hall, Llenroc, and 13 South Avenue (Deke House).[41] Three other listed historic buildings—the original Roberts Hall, East Robert Hall, and Stone Hall—were demolished in the 1980s to make way for new development.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Central, North, and West campuses[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cornell Central Campus, Cornell North Campus, and Cornell West Campus\n\nCentral Campus is the heart of the university, housing the majority of academic and administrative facilities. The architectural styles on Central Campus range from ornate Collegiate Gothic, Victorian, and Neoclassical buildings to more spare international, and modernist structures. Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park, proposed a \"grand terrace\" overlooking Cayuga Lake in one of the earliest plans for the campus.[43]\n\n\nNorth Campus features primarily residential buildings, with ten residence halls designed to accommodate first and second-year students, as well as transfer students in the Townhouse Community.,[44] The architectural styles of North Campus are more modern, reflecting the growth of the university and the need for additional housing during the mid-20th century.\n\n\nThe West Campus House System showcases a blend of architectural styles, with five main residence halls and several Gothic-style buildings collectively known as \"the Gothics.\" These Collegiate Gothic structures add a sense of historical charm to the campus, while the modern residence halls provide comfortable accommodations for students.\"[45]\n\n\nIn the nearby Collegetown neighborhood, the architectural styles are more diverse, reflecting the area's mixed-use nature. The Schwartz Performing Arts Center and two upper-level residence halls[46][47] are surrounded by a variety of apartment buildings, eateries, and businesses, creating a vibrant and lively atmosphere for students and residents alike.[48]\n\n\n\n#### Natural surroundings[edit]\n\n\nThe Ithaca campus is located in the Finger Lakes region and has views of the city, Cayuga Lake, and the surrounding valleys. The campus is bordered by two gorges, Fall Creek Gorge and Cascadilla Gorge, which contribute to the university's natural landscape. Although these gorges are popular swimming spots during warmer months, their use is discouraged by the university and city code due to potential safety hazards.[49] Adjacent to the main campus, Cornell owns the 2,800-acre (1,100 ha) Cornell Botanic Gardens, featuring various plants, trees, and ponds. The gardens' trails allow visitors to explore the natural surroundings.[50]\n\n\n\n#### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nCornell University has implemented various green initiatives to promote sustainability and reduce its environmental impact. Key projects include a gas-fired combined heat and power facility,[51] an on-campus hydroelectric plant,[52] and a lake source cooling system.[53] In 2007, Cornell established a Center for a Sustainable Future.[54] The university has committed to achieving net carbon neutrality by 2035[55] and, as of 2020, is powered by six solar farms providing a total of 28 megawatts of power.[56] Additionally, Cornell is developing an enhanced geothermal system, Earth Source Heating, to meet campus heating needs.[57]\n\n\n\n### New York City campuses[edit]\n\n\n#### Weill Cornell[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Weill Cornell Medicine\n\n![](image)Weill Medical Center on the East River of New York City's Upper East Side\nCornell's medical campus in New York City, also called Weill Cornell, is on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It is home to two Cornell divisions: Weill Cornell Medical College and Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, and has been affiliated with the New York-Presbyterian Hospital since 1927.[58] Although their faculty and academic divisions are separate, the Medical Center shares administrative and teaching hospital functions with the Columbia University Medical Center.[59] These teaching hospitals include the Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan and the Westchester Division in White Plains, New York.[60] Weill Cornell Medical College is also affiliated with the neighboring Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center, Rockefeller University, and the Hospital for Special Surgery. Many faculty members have joint appointments at these institutions. Weill Cornell, Rockefeller, and Memorial Sloan–Kettering offer the Tri-Institutional MD–PhD Program to selected entering Cornell medical students.[61] From 1942 to 1979, the campus also housed the Cornell School of Nursing.[62]\n\n\n\n#### Cornell Tech[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cornell Tech\n\n![](image)Cornell Tech in New York City, a graduate campus and research center.\nOn December 19, 2011, Cornell and the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology won a competition for rights to claim free city land and $100 million in subsidies to build an engineering campus in New York City. The competition was established by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to increase entrepreneurship and job growth in the city's technology sector. The winning bid consisted of a 2.1 million square foot state-of-the-art tech campus to be built on Roosevelt Island, on the site of the former Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital. Instruction began in the fall of 2012, in a temporary location at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan in space donated by Google.[63] Thom Mayne, of the architecture firm Morphosis, has been selected to design the first building to be constructed on Roosevelt Island. Begun in 2014, construction of the first phase of the campus was completed in September 2017.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Other New York City programs[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the tech campus and medical center, Cornell maintains local offices in New York City for some of its service programs. The Cornell Urban Scholars Program encourages students to pursue public service careers, arranging assignments with organizations working with New York City's poorest children, families, and communities.[65] The NYS College of Human Ecology and the NYS College of Agriculture and Life Sciences enable students to reach out to local communities by gardening and building with the Cornell Cooperative Extension.[66] Students with the NYS School of Industrial and Labor Relations' Extension and Outreach Program make workplace expertise available to organizations, union members, policymakers, and working adults.[67] The College of Engineering's Operations Research Manhattan, in the city's Financial District, brings together business optimization research and decision support services addressed to both financial applications and public health logistics planning.[68] The College of Architecture, Art, and Planning has an 11,000 square foot, Gensler-designed facility at 26 Broadway in the Financial District, that opened in 2015.[69]\n\n\n\n### Qatar campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar\n\nWeill Cornell Medical College in Qatar is in Education City, near Doha. Opened in September 2004, it was the first American medical school to be established outside of the United States. The college is part of Cornell's program to increase its international influence. The college is a joint initiative with the Qatar government, which seeks to improve the country's academic programs and medical care.[26] Along with its full four-year MD program, which mirrors the curriculum taught at Weill Medical College in New York City, the college offers a two-year undergraduate pre-medical program with a separate admissions process. This undergraduate program opened in September 2002 and was the first coeducational institute of higher education in Qatar.[70]\n\n\nThe college is partially funded by the Qatar government through the Qatar Foundation, which contributed $750 million for its construction.[71] The medical center is housed in a large two-story structure designed by Arata Isozaki, an internationally known Japanese architect.[72] In 2004, the Qatar Foundation announced the construction of a 350-bed Specialty Teaching Hospital, near the medical college in Education City. The hospital was to be completed in a few years.[26]\n\n\n\n### Other facilities[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences\n\n![](image)A World War I memorial on Cornell's West Campus in Ithaca\n![](image)Cornell's Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art designed by I. M. Pei\n![](image)The A.D. White Reading Room contains much of the 30,000 volume collection donated to the university by its co-founder and first president.\nCornell University owns and operates a variety of off-campus research facilities and offers study abroad and scholarship programs.[73] These facilities and programs contribute to the university's research endeavors and provide students with unique learning opportunities.\n\n\n\n#### Research facilities[edit]\n\n\nCornell's off-campus research facilities include Shoals Marine Laboratory, a seasonal marine field station on Appledore Island off the Maine–New Hampshire coast, is operated in conjunction with the University of New Hampshire and focuses on undergraduate education and research.[74] Until 2011, Cornell operated the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, which was the site of the world's largest single-dish radio telescope.[75]\n\n\nThe university also maintains several facilities dedicated to conservation and ecology, such as the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York. This station operates three substations, including the Cornell Lake Erie Research and Extension Laboratory in Portland,[76] the Hudson Valley Laboratory in Highland,[77] and the Long Island Horticultural Research Laboratory in Riverhead.[78] The Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca conducts research on biological diversity, primarily in birds,[79]\n\n\nOther research facilities include the Animal Science Teaching and Research Center, the Duck Research Laboratory, the Cornell Biological Field Station, the Freeville Organic Research Farm, the Homer C. Thompson Vegetable Research Farm, and biodiversity laboratories in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and the Peruvian Amazon Rainforest.[80][81][82][83][84][13]\n\n\n\n#### Study abroad and scholarship programs[edit]\n\n\nCornell offers various study abroad and scholarship programs that allow students to gain experience and earn credit towards their degrees. The \"Capital Semester\" program offers students the opportunity to intern in the New York State Legislature in Albany. The Cornell in Washington program enables students to spend a semester in Washington, D.C., participating in research or internships.[85] Similarly, the Cornell in Rome program, allows students to study architecture, urban studies, and the arts in Rome, Italy.[86]\n\n\n\n#### Cooperative extension service[edit]\n\n\nAs New York State's land-grant university, Cornell operates a cooperative extension service with 56 offices spread across the state. These offices provide programs in agriculture and food systems, children, youth and families, community and economic vitality, environment and natural resources, and nutrition and health.[87] Additionally, the university operates New York's Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which serves as a valuable resource for animal disease control and husbandry.[88]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| **College/school founding** |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| \n\n---\n\n |\n| Agriculture and Life Sciences | 1874\n |\n| Architecture, Art, and Planning | 1871\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | 1865\n |\n| Business | 1946\n |\n| Computing and Information Science | 2020\n |\n| Engineering | 1870\n |\n| Graduate School | 1909\n |\n| Hotel Administration | 1922\n |\n| Human Ecology | 1925\n |\n| Industrial and Labor Relations | 1945\n |\n| Law | 1887\n |\n| Medical Sciences | 1952\n |\n| Medicine | 1898\n |\n| Public Policy | 2021\n |\n| Tech | 2011\n |\n| Veterinary Medicine | 1894\n |\n\n\nCornell University is a non-profit organization with a decentralized structure where colleges and schools exercise wide autonomy in defining academic programs, admissions, advising, and conferring degrees. The university comprises nine privately endowed colleges and four publicly supported statutory colleges, offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs. Cornell operates eCornell for online professional development and certificate programs[89] and participates in New York's land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant programs.[90][91]\n\n\n\n### Governance and administration[edit]\n\n\nCornell University is governed by a 64-member board of trustees, which includes both privately and publicly appointed trustees. The board includes trustees appointed by the Governor of New York, alumni-elected trustees, faculty-elected trustees, student-elected trustees,[92] and non-academic staff-elected trustees. The Governor, Temporary President of the Senate, Speaker of the Assembly, and president of the university serve in an *ex officio* voting capacity. The board is responsible for electing a President to serve as the chief executive and educational officer.[93][94] Robert Harrison served as the chairman of the board from 2014 to 2022.[95] The Board of Trustees holds four regular meetings each year, subject to the New York State Open Meetings Law.[96] Kraig Kayser has served as the chairman of the board since 2022.\n\n\nMartha E. Pollack was inaugurated as Cornell's fourteenth president on August 25, 2017,[97][98] succeeding Elizabeth Garrett, who served from July 2015 until her death in March 2016.[99][100]\n\n\n\n### Colleges and academic structure[edit]\n\n\nCornell's colleges and schools offer a wide range of undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs. There are seven undergraduate colleges and seven schools offering graduate and professional programs. All academic departments at Cornell are affiliated with at least one college. A handful of inter-school academic departments offer courses in more than one college. Students pursuing graduate degrees in these schools are enrolled in the Graduate School. The School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions provides additional programs for college and high school students, professionals, and other adults.[101]\n\n\nCornell's statutory colleges include the New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, College of Human Ecology, School of Industrial and Labor Relations, and College of Veterinary Medicine. These colleges received $131.9 million in SUNY appropriations in 2010–2011 to support their teaching, research, and service missions, making them accountable to the State University of New York (SUNY) trustees and other state agencies.[102][103][104] New York residents enrolled in these colleges qualify for discounted tuition, however, their academic activities are considered by New York state to be private and non-state entities.[105]:1\n\n\nCornell's nine privately endowed, non-statutory colleges include the College of Arts and Sciences, College of Engineering, College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, and College of Hotel Administration. These colleges operate independently of state funding and oversight, giving them greater autonomy in determining their academic programs, admissions, and advising. They also do not offer discounted tuition for New York residents.\n\n\nOf the 15,182 undergraduate students at Cornell, 4,602 (30.3%) are affiliated with the largest college by enrollment, Arts and Sciences, followed by 3,203 (21.1%) in Engineering and 3,101 (20.4%) in Agriculture and Life Sciences. The smallest of the seven undergraduate colleges is Architecture, Art, and Planning, with 503 (3.3%) students.[4] The only university-wide requirements for a baccalaureate degree are to pass a swimming test, take two physical education courses, and satisfy a writing requirement. \n\n\n\n### Fundraising and financial support[edit]\n\n\nCornell University has a robust fundraising program, ranking third among U.S. universities in 2018 (behind Harvard and Stanford), collecting $743 million in private support.[106] Each college and program has its own staffed fundraising program, in addition to the central University development staff located in Ithaca and New York City.\n\n\nIn recent years, Cornell has been the recipient of several major donations that have enabled the university to expand its reach, create new programs, and drive advancements in education and research. Charles Feeney, founder of DFS Group, is Cornell's largest donor, having given one billion dollars to the university to fund numerous initiatives, including Cornell Tech, a cutting-edge technology-focused campus in New York City.[107] In 2017, the university also received a donation of $150 million from H. Fisk Johnson of S. C. Johnson & Son to create of the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business, the second largest ever gift to a business school.[108] Furthermore, the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future was established in 2010 following an $80 million donation from David Atkinson and his wife, Patricia.[109] In 2015, Joan and Irwin M. Jacobs, founder of Qualcomm, donated $133 million to fund the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech.[110] The Weill Cornell Medical College was founded thanks to a $100 million donation in 1998 from Citibank head Sanford I. Weill and his wife, Joan, with the Weills providing over $600 million in total lifetime donations to the university.[111]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\nCornell is a large, primarily residential research university with a majority of enrollments in undergraduate programs.[112] The university has been accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education or its predecessor since 1921.[113] Cornell operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall term beginning in late August and ending in early December, a three-week winter session in January, and the spring term beginning in late January and ending in early May.[114]\n\n\nCornell, along with Oregon State University, Pennsylvania State University, University of Georgia, and University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, are the only institutions to be land-grant universities that are also members of the other three \"grant\" programs: sea grant, space grant, and sun grant. Cornell is the only such private university.\n\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2022 enteringclass[115]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 6.9% |\n| Yield rate | 69% |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT EBRW | 700–760 |\n| SAT Math | 750–800 |\n| ACT Composite | 33–35 |\n| High school GPA[i] |\n| Top 10% | 83.7% |\n| Top 25% | 97.7% |\n| Top 50% | 99.9% |\n| 1. **^** Among students whose school ranked\n |\n\n\nAdmission to Cornell University is highly competitive. In spring of 2022 (Class of 2026), Cornell's undergraduate programs received 71,164 applications and admitted only 5,168 for a 7.2% acceptance rate.[116] For Fall 2019 enrolling freshmen, the middle 50% range of SAT scores were 680–760 for evidence-based reading and writing and 720–800 for mathematics.[117] The middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 32–35.[117]\n\n\nThe university continues to attract a diverse and inclusive student body. The proportion of admitted students who self-identify as underrepresented minorities increased to 34.2% from 33.7% in 2021, and 59.3% self-identify as students of color. That number has increased steadily over the past five years, enrollment officials said, from 52.5% in 2017 and 57.2% in 2020.\n\n\nOf those admitted, 1,163 will be first-generation college students, another increase over 2020's 844.[118] The university is need-blind for domestic applicants.[119]\n\n\n\n### Financial aid[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The sarcophagus in Sage Chapel of Jennie McGraw, a Cornell benefactor.\nCornell University, under Section 9 of its original charter, ensures equal access to education by admitting students without distinction based on rank, class, occupation, or locality.[120] The charter also mandates free instruction for one student from each Assembly district in the state.[120]\n\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1980s, Cornell collaborated with other Ivy League institutions to establish a uniform financial aid system.[121] Although a 1989 consent decree ended this collaboration due to an antitrust investigation, all Ivy League schools still offer need-based financial aid without athletic scholarships.[122] In December 2010, Cornell pledged to match any grant component of financial aid offers from other Ivy League schools, MIT, Duke, or Stanford for accepted applicants considering these institutions.[123]\n\n\nIn 2008, Cornell introduced a financial aid initiative, gradually replacing need-based loans with scholarships for undergraduate students from lower-income families.[124] Despite a 27% drop in the university's endowment in 2008, the then-president allocated additional funds to continue the initiative, seeking to raise $125 million in donations for its support.[125] By 2010, Cornell successfully met the full financial aid needs of 40% of full-time freshmen with financial need, and the average undergraduate student debt upon graduation was $21,549.[126]\n\n\n\n### International programs[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cornell South East Asia Program and Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar\n\n![](image)Cornell students performing a Raas, a traditional folk dance from India\nCornell is actively involved in fostering international cooperation and engagement through various academic programs, research collaborations, and global partnerships. As a member of the United Nations Academic Impact, the university aligns itself with the United Nations' goals and promotes international collaboration among institutions of higher education.\n\n\n\n#### Academic programs and study abroad opportunities[edit]\n\n\nCornell offers a wide range of undergraduate majors with an international focus, including Africana Studies, Asian-Pacific American Studies, French Studies, German Studies, Jewish Studies, Latino Studies, Near Eastern Studies, Romance Studies, and Russian Literature.[13] Students have the opportunity to study abroad on any of the six continents through various programs.[127]\n\n\nThe Asian Studies major, Southeast Asia Program, Southeast Asia Program, and China and Asia-Pacific Studies (CAPS) major provide opportunities for students and researchers focusing on Asia. Cornell has an agreement with Peking University, allowing CAPS students to spend a semester in Beijing.[128] Similarly, the College of Engineering exchanges faculty and graduate students with Tsinghua University in Beijing, while the School of Hotel Administration has a joint master's program with Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\n\nIn the Middle East, Cornell's efforts are centered on biology and medicine. The Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar trains new doctors to improve health services in the region.[129] The university is also involved in developing the Bridging the Rift Center, a \"Library of Life\" (or database of all living systems) on the border of Israel and Jordan, in collaboration with those two countries and Stanford University.[130]\n\n\nThe university also has agreements with several institutions around the world for student and faculty exchange programs, including Bocconi University, the University of Warwick, Japan's National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences,[131] the University of the Philippines Los Baños,[132] and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)1920 graduation ceremony\n#### Joint-degree programs[edit]\n\n\nCornell offers several joint-degree programs with international universities. The university is the only US member school in the CEMS Alliance, and its Master's in International Management program offers the CEMS Master's in International Management (CEMS MIM) as a double degree option. This enables students to study at one of 34 CEMS partner universities. Cornell has also partnered with Queen's University in Canada to offer a joint Executive MBA program.[134] Graduates of the program earn both a Cornell MBA and a Queen's MBA. Additionally, Cornell offers an international consulting course in association with the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, further emphasizing its commitment to international cooperation and education.[135]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[136] | 10 |\n| *Forbes*[137] | 12 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[138] | 12 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[139] | 8 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[140] | 11 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[141] | 12 |\n| *QS*[142] | 13 |\n| *THE*[143] | 20 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[144] | 21 |\n\n\nCornell University consistently ranks among the top institutions in various national and international rankings. Notable recent rankings include 7th in the US by QS World University Rankings and 9th by Times Higher Education World University Rankings.[145][146] The institution also garners praise for its contributions to research, community service, and social mobility, as well as its commitment to sustainability, as evidenced by its placement in The Washington Monthly and The Princeton Review's rankings.[147] In 2017, the university was ranked 7th in *The Princeton Review'*s \"Top 50 Green Colleges\".[148]\n\n\nIn its annual edition of \"America's Best Architecture & Design Schools\", the journal *Design Intelligence* has frequently ranked Cornell's Bachelor of Architecture program as number one in the nation (2000–2002, 2005–2007, 2009–2013, and 2015–2016). In the 2011 survey, the program ranked first and the Master of Architecture program ranked 6th.[149] In 2017, Design Intelligence ranked Cornell's Master of Landscape Architecture program 4th in the nation with the Bachelor of Science in Landscape Architecture program ranking 5th among its undergraduate counterparts.[150][151] Among business schools in the United States, the Johnson School of Management at Cornell was named the 9th best business school by *Forbes* in 2019,[152] 8th by *The Washington Post* for salary potential, 13th overall by *Poets and Quants* in 2020[153] but 4th for investment banking[154] and 6th for salary worldwide in 2015,[155] 11th nationally by *Bloomberg Businessweek* in 2019,[156] and 11th nationally and 14th worldwide by *The Economist* in 2019.[157] In 2013, the Johnson school was ranked 2nd for sustainability by *Bloomberg Businessweek*.[158]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cornell's 2008 commencement ceremony at Schoellkopf Field\nCornell's international relations offerings are also ranked in *Foreign Policy* magazine's Inside the Ivory Tower survey, which lists the world's top 20 international relations programs at the undergraduate, Master's, and Ph.D. levels.[159] In 2012, the survey ranked Cornell 11th overall for doctoral programs and 12th overall in the undergraduate category.[160] In 2015, Cornell was ranked third in New York State by average professor salaries.[161]\n\n\n\n### Library[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cornell University Library\n\n![](image)The Cornell Law Library is one of 12 national depositories for print records of briefs filed with the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Cornell University Library is the 11th largest academic library in the United States, ranked by number of volumes held.[162] Organized into 20 divisions, in 2005 it held 7.5 million printed volumes in open stacks, 8.2 million microfilms and microfiches, and a total of 440,000 maps, motion pictures, DVDs, sound recordings, and computer files in its collections, in addition to extensive digital resources and the University Archives.[163] It was the first among all U.S. colleges and universities to allow undergraduates to borrow books from its libraries.[13] In 2006, *The Princeton Review* ranked it as the 11th best college library,[164] and it climbed to 6th best in 2009.[165] The library plays an active role in furthering online archiving of scientific and historical documents. arXiv, an e-print archive created at Los Alamos National Laboratory by Paul Ginsparg, is operated and primarily funded by Cornell as part of the library's services. The archive has changed the way many physicists and mathematicians communicate, making the e-print a viable and popular means of announcing new research.[166]\n\n\n\n### Press and scholarly publications[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cornell University Press\n\nCornell University Press, established in 1869 but inactive from 1884 to 1930, was the first university publishing enterprise in the United States.[167][168] Today, the press is one of the country's largest university presses.[13] It produces approximately 150 nonfiction titles each year in various disciplines including anthropology, Asian studies, biological sciences, classics, history, industrial relations, literary criticism and theory, natural history, politics and international relations, veterinary science, and women's studies.[168][169]\n\n\nCornell's academic units and student groups also publish a number of scholarly journals. Faculty-led publications include the Johnson School's *Administrative Science Quarterly*,[170] the ILR School's *Industrial and Labor Relations Review*, the Arts and Sciences Philosophy Department's *The Philosophical Review*, the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning's *Journal of Architecture*, and the Law School's *Journal of Empirical Legal Studies*.[171] Student-led scholarly publications include the *Law Review*, the Cornell Institute for Public Affairs' *Cornell Policy Review*, the *International Law Journal*, the *Journal of Law and Public Policy*, the *International Affairs Review*, and the *HR Review*. *Physical Review*, recognized internationally as among the best and well known journals of physics, was founded at Cornell in 1893 before being later managed by the American Physical Society.\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cornell's Center for Advanced Computing was one of the five original centers of the NSF's Supercomputer Centers Program.\n![](image)Cornell Botanic Gardens, located adjacent to the Ithaca campus, is used for conservation research and for recreation by Cornellians\n![](image)In the basement of Goldwin Smith Hall, researchers in the Dendrochronology Lab determine the age of archaeological artifacts found at archeological digs.\nCornell University is a prominent research institution, classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[172] In the 2016–17 fiscal year, the university spent $984.5 million on research, with federal sources contributing the largest share of research funding at $438.2 million.[173] The Department of Health and Human Services and the National Science Foundation are the primary federal investors, accounting for 49.6% and 24.4% of all federal investments, respectively.[174] Cornell is ranked fourth in the world for producing graduates who pursue PhDs in engineering or natural sciences at American institutions and fifth for graduates pursuing PhDs in any field.[175]\n\n\n\n### Science, technology, and engineering research[edit]\n\n\nCornell has a rich history of scientific, technological, and engineering research accomplishments. The university has made significant contributions to the fields of nuclear physics, high-energy physics, space exploration, automotive safety, and computing technology, among others. Cornell consistently ranks among the top U.S. universities for patent acquisition and start-up company formation.[176] In the 2004–05 academic year, the university filed 203 U.S. patent applications, completed 77 commercial license agreements, and distributed royalties of more than $4.1 million to Cornell units and inventors.[13] In 2009 Cornell spent $671 million on science and engineering research and development, the 16th highest in the United States.[177]\n\n\nCornell has been involved in uncrewed missions to Mars since 1962[178] and played a vital role in the Mars Exploration Rover Mission in the 21st century.[179] The university's researchers discovered the rings around the planet Uranus[180] and operated the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico until 2011. This observatory housed the world's largest single-dish radio telescope at the time.[181]\n\n\nThe Automotive Crash Injury Research Project, begun in 1952, was a pioneering effort in crash testing and significantly improved vehicle safety standards.[182] It was the first to use corpses instead of dummies for testing, leading to crucial findings about the effectiveness of seat belts, energy-absorbing steering wheels, padded dashboards, and improved door locks.[182]\n\n\nCornell has long been at the forefront of advancements in computing technology. In the 1980s, the university deployed the first IBM 3090-400VF and coupled two IBM 3090-600E systems to investigate coarse-grained parallel computing. As part of the National Science Foundation's initiative to establish new supercomputer centers, the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing was founded. Cornell has continued to innovate in this area, most recently deploying Red Cloud, a cloud computing service designed specifically for research. The Red Cloud service is now part of the NSF's Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) supercomputing program.[183]\n\n\nIn the realm of high-energy physics, Cornell scientists have been researching fundamental particles for over 75 years. The university has played an integral role in the foundations of nuclear physics, with faculty members such as Hans Bethe and others participating in the Manhattan Project. In the 1930s, Cornell built the second cyclotron in the United States and, in the 1950s, became the first to study synchrotron radiation. The Cornell Electron Storage Ring, located beneath Alumni Field, was once the world's highest-luminosity electron-positron collider.[184][185] Cornell's accelerator and high-energy physics groups are involved in the design of the proposed International Linear Collider, which will complement the Large Hadron Collider and shed light on questions related to dark matter and the existence of extra dimensions.[186]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[187] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 35%\n | 35 |\n| Asian | 21%\n | 21 |\n| Hispanic | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Other[c] | 13%\n | 13 |\n| Foreign national | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[d] | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Affluent[e] | 84%\n | 84 |\n\n\n### Activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Interior windows of Barton Hall, an on-campus field house\n![](image)Fuertes Observatory on Cornell North Campus\nFor the 2016–2017 academic year, Cornell had over 1,000 registered student organizations. These clubs and organizations run the gamut from kayaking to full-armor jousting, from varsity and club sports and a cappella groups to improvisational theatre, from political clubs and publications to chess and video game clubs.[188] The Cornell International Affairs Society sends over 100 Cornellians to collegiate Model United Nations conferences across North America and hosts the Cornell Model United Nations Conference each spring for over 500 high school students. The Cornell University Mock Trial Association regularly sends teams to the national championship and is ranked 5th in the nation.[189] Additionally, the Cornell International Affairs Society's traveling Model United Nations team is ranked number 16 in the nation.[190] Cornell United Religious Work is a collaboration among many diverse religious traditions, helping to provide spiritual resources throughout a student's time at college. The Cornell Catholic Community is the largest Catholic student organization on campus. Student organizations also include a myriad of groups including a symphony orchestra,[191] concert bands,[192] formal and informal choral groups,[193] including the Sherwoods, the Chordials[194] and other musical groups that play everything from classical, jazz, to ethnic styles in addition to the Big Red Marching Band, which performs regularly at football games and other campus events.[195]\n\n\nOrganized in 1868, the oldest Cornell student organization is the Cornell University Glee Club.[196] Apart from musical groups, Cornell has an active outdoor community, consisting of Cornell Outdoor Education, Cornell Outing Club Archived 20 December 2018 at the Wayback Machine, and Outdoor Odyssey, a student-run group that runs pre-orientation trips for first-year and transfer students. A Cornell student organization, The Cornell Astronomical Society, runs public observing nights every Friday evening at the Fuertes Observatory. The university is home to the Telluride House, an intellectual residential society. The university is also home to three secret honor societies called Sphinx Head,[197] Der Hexenkreis and Quill and Dagger[198][199] that have maintained a presence on campus for well over 120 years.\n\n\nCornell's clubs are primarily subsidized financially by the Student Assembly and the Graduate & Professional Student Assembly, two student-run organizations with a collective budget of $3.0 million per year.[200][201] The assemblies also finance other student life programs including a concert commission and an on-campus theater.\n\n\n\n### Greek life, professional, and honor societies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Cornell University fraternities and sororities\n\nCornell hosts a large[202][203][204][205][206] fraternity and sorority system, with 70 chapters involving 33% of male and 24% of female undergraduates.[207][208][209] Cornell's Greek Life has an extensive history on the campus with the first fraternity, Zeta Psi, being chartered by the end of the university's first year.[210] Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek organization established for African Americans, was founded at Cornell in 1906.[211][212] Alpha Zeta fraternity, the first Greek-lettered organization established for Latin Americans in the United States, was also founded at Cornell on January 1, 1890. Alpha Zeta served the wealthy international Latin American students that came to the United States to study. This organization led a movement of fraternities that catered to international Latin American students that was active from 1890 to 1975.[213] On 19 February 1982, La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda fraternity was established;[214] it would eventually become the only Latino based fraternity in the nation with chapters at every Ivy League institution.[215] Latinas Promoviendo Comunidad/Lambda Pi Chi sorority was established on 16 April 1988, making the organization the first Latina-Based, and not Latina-exclusive, sorority founded at an ivy-league institution.[216]\n\n\nCornell's connection to national Greek life is strong and longstanding. Many chapters are among the oldest of their respective national organizations, as evidenced by the proliferation of *Alpha-series* chapters. The chapter house of Alpha Delta Phi constructed in 1877 is believed to be the first house built in America solely for fraternity use, and the chapter's current home was designed by John Russell Pope.[217] Philanthropy opportunities are used to encourage community relations, for example, during the 2004–05 academic year, the Greek system contributed 21,668 community service and advocacy hours and raised $176,547 in charitable contributions from its philanthropic efforts.[208] Generally, discipline is managed internally by the inter-Greek governing boards. As with all student, faculty or staff misconduct, more serious cases are reviewed by the Judicial Administrator, who administers Cornell's justice system.[208]\n\n\n\n### Press and radio[edit]\n\n\nThe Cornell student body produces several works by way of print and radio. Student-run newspapers include *The Cornell Daily Sun*, an independent daily; *The Cornell Review*, a conservative newspaper published fortnightly; and *The Cornell Progressive*, a liberal newspaper published monthly.\n\n\nOther press outlets include *The Cornell Lunatic*, a campus humor magazine; the *Cornell Chronicle*, the university's newspaper of record; and *Kitsch Magazine*, a feature magazine published in cooperation with Ithaca College. *The Cornellian* is an independent student organization that organizes, arranges, produces, edits, and publishes the yearbook of the same name; it is composed of artistic photos of the campus, student life, and athletics, and the standard senior portraits. It carries the Silver Crown Award for Journalism and a Benjamin Franklin Award for Print Design – the only Ivy League Yearbook with such a distinction.[218] Cornellians are represented over the radio waves on WVBR-FM, an independent commercial FM radio station owned and operated by Cornell students. Other student groups also operate internet streaming audio sites.[219]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of several footbridges that span Cornell's gorges and ease commuting from housing to academic buildings on campus\nUniversity housing is broadly divided into three sections: North Campus, West Campus, and Collegetown. Cornell began experiments with co-ed dormitories in 1971 and continued the tradition of residential advisors (RAs) within the campus system. In 1991, new students could be found throughout West Campus, including at the historic Baker and Boldt Hall complexes; since a 1997 residential initiative, West Campus houses transfer and returning students, whereas North Campus is almost entirely populated by freshmen as well as sorority and fraternity houses.[220]\n\n\nOptions for living on North Campus for upperclassmen include program houses and co-op houses. Program houses include Risley Residential College, Just About Music, the Ecology House, Holland International Living Center, the Multicultural Living Learning Unit, the Latino Living Center, Akwe:kon, and Ujamaa. The co-op houses on North are The Prospect of Whitby, Triphammer Cooperative, Wait Avenue Cooperative, Wari Cooperative, and Wait Terrace.[221] On West Campus, there are three university-affiliated cooperatives, 660 Stewart Cooperative, Von Cramm Hall, and Watermargin, and one independent cooperative, Cayuga Lodge. In an attempt to create a sense of community and an atmosphere of education outside the classroom and continue Andrew Dickson White's vision, a $250 million reconstruction of West Campus created residential colleges there for undergraduates.[222] The idea of building a house system can be attributed in part to the success of Risley Residential College, the oldest continually operating residential college at Cornell.[223] In 2018, Cornell announced its North Campus Residential Expansive project. By 2022, the university aims to add 2,000 beds on North Campus. Five new dorms and a dining hall will be created, three of which will be located in Appel Field and will be exclusive for freshmen. Sophomores will have two new dorms located in the current CC Parking Lot.[224]\n\n\nCornell has several housing areas for graduate and professional students. Of these, Schuyler House, which was formerly a part of Sage Infirmary,[225] has a dorm layout. Maplewood Apartments, Hasbrouck Apartments, and Thurston Court Apartments are apartment-style, some even allowing for family living. Off campus, many single-family houses in the East Hill neighborhoods adjacent to the university have been converted to apartments. Private developers have also built several multi-story apartment complexes in the Collegetown neighborhood. Nine percent of undergraduate students reside in fraternity and sorority houses, although first semester freshmen are not permitted to join them.[226] Cornell's Greek system has 67 chapters and over 54 Greek residences that house approximately 1,500 students. About 42% of Greek members live in their houses.[227] Housing cooperatives or other independent living units exist, including Telluride House, the Center for Jewish Living, Phillips House (located on North Campus, 1975 all women; 2016, all men), and Center for World Community (international community, off campus, formed by Annabel Taylor Hall, 1972, mixed gender).[228] The cooperative houses on North include The Prospect of Whitby, Triphammer Cooperative, Wait Avenue Cooperative, Wari Cooperative, and Wait Terrace.[221] On West Campus, there are three university-affiliated cooperatives, 660 Stewart Cooperative, Von Cramm Cooperative Hall, and \"Watermargin\"., and one independent cooperative, \"Cayuga Lodge\". Besides this, there exists also cooperative housing not owned by Cornell, like Gamma Alpha or Stewart Little.\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], Cornell's dining system was ranked fourth in the nation by The Princeton Review.[229] The university has 29 on-campus dining locations, including 10 \"All You Care to Eat\" cafeterias.[230] North Campus is home to 3 of these dining halls: Morrison Dining (located by Morrison Hall), North Star Dining Room (located in the Appel Commons), and Risley Dining (located in Risley Hall).[230] West Campus houses 6 dining halls, 5 of which accompany the West Campus residential houses: Cook House Dining Room, Becker House Dining Room, Rose House Dining Room, Jansen's Dining Room at Hans Bethe House, and Keeton House Dining Room.[230] Also located on West Campus is 104West!, a kosher/multicultural dining room.[230] Central Campus accommodates just a single dining hall: Okenshields, located in Willard Straight Hall.[230]\n\n\n\nVarious Cornell housing facilities\n![](image)\nBaker Dormitories\n![](image)\nBalch Hall\n![](image)\nHans Bethe House\n![](image)\nRisley Hall\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cornell Big Red\n\n![](image)A 1908 print depicting a Cornell Big Red baseball player\nCornell has 35[231] varsity intercollegiate teams that have the nickname of the Big Red. An NCAA division I institution, Cornell is a member of the Ivy League and ECAC Hockey and competes in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), the largest athletic conference in North America.[232] (ECAC Hockey is no longer affiliated with the ECAC.) Cornell's varsity athletic teams consistently challenge for NCAA Division I titles in a number of sports, including men's wrestling, men's lacrosse, men's ice hockey, and rowing (the women's crew program is subject to the NCAA, while the men's rowing program is governed by its own administrative body, the Intercollegiate Rowing Association). Under the Ivy League athletic agreement, the university does not offer athletic scholarships for athletic recruiting.[233]\n\n\nCornell's football team had at least a share of the national championship four times before 1940[234][235] and has won the Ivy League championship three times, last in 1990.[236]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Cornell men's basketball team appeared for the first time in the NCAA tournament's East Regional semifinals, known as the \"Sweet 16\". It was the first Ivy League team to make the semifinals since 1979.[237]\n\n\n\n### Cornell Outdoor Education[edit]\n\n\nCornell runs one of the largest collegiate outdoor education programs in the country, serving over 20,000 people every year. The program runs over 130 different courses including but not limited to: Backpacking and Camping, Mountain Biking, Bike Touring, Caving, Hiking, Rock and Ice Climbing, Wilderness First Aid, and tree climbing.[238] COE also oversees one of the largest student-run pre-freshman summer programs, known as Outdoor Odyssey.[239] Most classes are often entirely taught by paid student instructors and courses count toward Cornell's physical education graduation requirement.[240]\n\n\nOne notable facility at Cornell Outdoor Education is the Lindseth Climbing Wall. The wall was renovated in 2016, and now includes 8,000 square feet of climbing surface up from 4,800 square feet previously.[241] The new wall now offers a more modern environment with bouldering, top-rope, and lead climbing facilities appropriate for various skill levels.[242]\n\n\n\n### Cornelliana[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cornelliana\n\n![](image)A tradition started in 1901, Dragon Day celebrates a feat by freshman architecture students to construct a colossal dragon that is paraded to center campus and then burned.\n![](image)An ivy-covered emblem of Ezra Cornell circumscribed by the university motto\nCornelliana is a term for Cornell's traditions, legends, and lore. Cornellian traditions include Slope Day, a celebration held on the last day of classes of the spring semester, and Dragon Day, which includes the burning of a dragon built by architecture students. Dragon Day is one of the school's oldest traditions and has been celebrated annually since 1901, typically on or near St. Patrick's Day. The dragon is built secretly by the architecture students, and taunting messages are left for the engineering students for the week before Dragon Day. On Dragon Day, the dragon is paraded across the Arts Quad and then set afire.[243]\n\n\nAccording to legend, if a virgin crosses the Arts Quad at midnight, the statues of Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White will walk off their pedestals, meet in the center of the Quad, and shake hands, congratulating themselves on the chastity of students. There is also another myth that if a couple crosses the suspension bridge on North Campus, and the young woman does not accept a kiss from her partner, the bridge will fall. If the kiss is accepted, the couple is assured a long future together.[244]\n\n\nThe university is also host to various student pranks. For example, on at least two different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7 m) tall McGraw clock tower—once a 60-pound (27 kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery.[245] The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day.[246] The clock tower also plays music.\n\n\nThe school colors are carnelian (a shade of red) and white, a play on \"Cornellian\" and Andrew Dickson White. A bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the mascot \"Touchdown\" in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games.[8] The university's alma mater is \"Far Above Cayuga's Waters\", and its fight song is \"Give My Regards to Davy\". People associated with the university are called \"Cornellians\".\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nCornell offers a variety of professional and peer counseling services to students.[247] Formerly called Gannett Health Services until its name change in 2016, Cornell Health offers on-campus outpatient health services with emergency services and residential treatment provided by Cayuga Medical Center.[248] For most of its history, Cornell provided residential medical care for sick students, including at the historic Sage Infirmary.[249] Cornell offers specialized reproductive health and family planning services.[250] The university also has a student-run Emergency Medical Service (EMS) agency. The squad provides emergency response to medical emergencies on the campus at Cornell and surrounding university-owned properties. Cornell EMS also provides stand-by service for university events and provides CPR, First Aid and other training seminars to the Cornell community.[251]\n\n\nThe university received attention for a series of six student suicides by jumping into a gorge that occurred during the 2009–10 school year, and after the incidents added temporary fences to the bridges which span area gorges.[252] In May 2013, Cornell indicated that it planned to set up nets, which will extend out 15 feet, on five of the university's bridges.[253] Installation of the nets began in May 2013 and were completed over the summer of that year.[252] There were cases of gorge-jumping in the 1970s and 1990s.[254] Before this abnormal cluster of suicides, the suicide rate at Cornell had been similar to or below the suicide rates of other American universities, including a period between 2005 and 2008 in which no suicides occurred.[255][256]\n\n\n\n### Campus police[edit]\n\n\nCornell University Police protect the campus and are classified as peace officers and have the same authority as the Ithaca city police. They are similar to the campus police at Ithaca College, Syracuse University, and University of Rochester because those campus police are classified as armed peace officers.

The student body for the fall 2022 semester consisted of more than 15,000 undergraduate and 7,000 graduate students from all 50 American states and 130 countries.[4]\n\n\nThe university is organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus[9] with each college and division defining its specific admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university also administers three satellite campuses, including two in New York City and one in the Education City region of Qatar.[9]\n\n\nCornell is one of the few private land grant universities in the United States.[a] Of its seven undergraduate colleges, three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State University of New York system, including its agricultural and human ecology colleges and its industrial labor relations school. Among Cornell's graduate schools, only the veterinary college is state-supported. The main campus of Cornell University in Ithaca spans 745 acres (301 ha).\n\n\nAs of October 2023,[update] there have been 62 Nobel laureates, 4 Turing Award winners, and 1 Fields Medalist affiliated with Cornell. Cornell counts more than 250,000 living alumni and its former and present faculty and alumni include 34 Marshall Scholars,[10] 33 Rhodes Scholars, 29 Truman Scholars, 7 Gates Scholars, 63 Olympic Medalists, 10 current Fortune 500 CEOs, and 35 billionaire alumni.[11][12][13][14][15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Cornell University\n\nCornell's founders\n![](image)\nEzra Cornell\n![](image)\nAndrew Dickson White\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFile:Cornell+University.jpgMcGraw Tower with Uris Library, Morrill Hall, and Cayuga Lake visible\nCornell University was founded on April 27, 1865, by Ezra Cornell, an entrepreneur and New York State Senator, and Andrew Dickson White, an educator and fellow New York State Senator, after the New York State legislature authorized the university as the state's land grant institution.[16] Ezra Cornell offered his farm in Ithaca, New York as a preliminary site for the university along with $500,000 of his personal fortune as an initial endowment (equivalent to $12,373,000 in 2023), and White agreed to be Cornell University's first president.\n\n\nDuring Cornell University's first three years, White oversaw the construction of the first two buildings and traveled to attract students and faculty.[17] The university was inaugurated on October 7, 1868, and 412 men were enrolled the next day.[18]\n\n\nCornell developed as a technologically innovative institution, applying its research to its own campus and to outreach efforts. In 1883, it was one of the first university campuses to use electricity from a water-powered dynamo to light the campus grounds.[19] Since 1894, Cornell has included colleges that are state funded and fulfill statutory requirements;[20] it has also administered research and extension activities that have been jointly funded by New York state along with federal government matching programs.[21]\n\n\nCornell has had active alumni since its earliest classes. It was one of the first universities to include alumni-elected representatives on its board of trustees.[b]\n\n\nCornell is home to the Cornell University Press, founded in 1869, the country's oldest publishing enterprise. Cornell was first home to the Cornell Era, a weekly campus publication founded in 1868. But the Cornell Daily Sun, an independent student-run newspaper founded in 1880 became the school's leading publication. Today, the Sun is the oldest continuously independent college daily in the United States.\n\n\nIn the 19th century, Cornell was also home to numerous literary societies, founded to encourage writing, reading, and oration skills. The U.S. Bureau of Education described three of them as a \"purely literary society\" following the \"traditions of the old literary societies of Eastern universities. These societies largely disappeared by the 20th century.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nCornell was among the Ivies that experienced heightened student activism during the 1960s, related to cultural issues, civil rights, and opposition to the Vietnam War. Protests and occupations resulted in the resignation of Cornell's president and the restructuring of university governance.[25]\n\n\nIn 1967, Cornell experienced a fire in the Residential Club dormitory that killed eight students and one professor.\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar\n\nSince 2000, Cornell has been expanding its international programs. In 2004, the university opened the Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar.[26] It has partnerships with institutions in India, Singapore, and the People's Republic of China.[27][28][29] The former president, Jeffrey S. Lehman, described the university, with its high international profile, as a \"transnational university\".[30] On March 9, 2004, Cornell and Stanford University laid the cornerstone for a new 'Bridging the Rift Center' to be built and jointly operated for education on the Israel–Jordan border.[31]\n\n\n\nA graduate student group, At What Cost?, formed at Cornell in August 2002 to oppose a graduate student unionization drive run by an organization called CASE/UAW that was affiliated with the United Auto Workers. The unionization vote was held October 23–24, 2002, and the union was rejected. At What Cost? was considered instrumental in the unusually large 90% turnout for the vote and in the 2-to-1 defeat of the unionization proposal. There had been no prior instance in American graduate student unionization history where a unionization proposal was defeated by a vote.[32][33][34]\n\n\nCornell also opened a graduate campus and research center on Roosevelt Island, Manhattan, New York City.\n\n\nThe university offers over 4,000 courses as of 2023.[35]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Arts Quad on Cornell's main campus with McGraw Tower in the background\n![](image)Ho Plaza seen from McGraw Tower with Sage Hall and Barnes Hall in the background\n![](image)Sage Chapel on the Cornell campus hosts religious services and concerts and is the final resting place of Ezra Cornell, the university's founder\n### Ithaca campus[edit]\n\n\nCornell University's main campus is located in Ithaca, New York, on East Hill, offering views of the city and Cayuga Lake. The campus has expanded to approximately 745 acres (301 ha) since its founding, comprising academic buildings, laboratories, administrative facilities, athletic centers, auditoriums, museums, and residential areas.[36][37] In 2011, *Travel+Leisure* recognized the Ithaca Campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States, praising its unique blend of architectural styles, historic landmarks, and picturesque surroundings.[38]\n\n\nThe Ithaca campus is characterized by an irregular layout and a mix of architectural styles, which have developed over time due to the university's ever-changing master plans for the campus. The more ornate buildings generally predate World War II, while the student population doubled from 7,000 in 1950 to 15,000 by 1970, leading to modernist architectural styles becoming more prevalent.[39]\n\n\nSeveral university buildings are listed as historic landmarks,[40] highlighting the architectural and historical significance of the campus. Those listed on the National Register of Historic Places include the Andrew Dickson White House, Bailey Hall, Caldwell Hall, the Computing and Communications Center, Morrill Hall, Rice Hall, Fernow Hall, Wing Hall, Llenroc, and 13 South Avenue (Deke House).[41] Three other listed historic buildings—the original Roberts Hall, East Robert Hall, and Stone Hall—were demolished in the 1980s to make way for new development.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Central, North, and West campuses[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cornell Central Campus, Cornell North Campus, and Cornell West Campus\n\nCentral Campus is the heart of the university, housing the majority of academic and administrative facilities. The architectural styles on Central Campus range from ornate Collegiate Gothic, Victorian, and Neoclassical buildings to more spare international, and modernist structures. Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park, proposed a \"grand terrace\" overlooking Cayuga Lake in one of the earliest plans for the campus.[43]\n\n\nNorth Campus features primarily residential buildings, with ten residence halls designed to accommodate first and second-year students, as well as transfer students in the Townhouse Community.,[44] The architectural styles of North Campus are more modern, reflecting the growth of the university and the need for additional housing during the mid-20th century.\n\n\nThe West Campus House System showcases a blend of architectural styles, with five main residence halls and several Gothic-style buildings collectively known as \"the Gothics.\" These Collegiate Gothic structures add a sense of historical charm to the campus, while the modern residence halls provide comfortable accommodations for students.\"[45]\n\n\nIn the nearby Collegetown neighborhood, the architectural styles are more diverse, reflecting the area's mixed-use nature. The Schwartz Performing Arts Center and two upper-level residence halls[46][47] are surrounded by a variety of apartment buildings, eateries, and businesses, creating a vibrant and lively atmosphere for students and residents alike.[48]\n\n\n\n#### Natural surroundings[edit]\n\n\nThe Ithaca campus is located in the Finger Lakes region and has views of the city, Cayuga Lake, and the surrounding valleys. The campus is bordered by two gorges, Fall Creek Gorge and Cascadilla Gorge, which contribute to the university's natural landscape. Although these gorges are popular swimming spots during warmer months, their use is discouraged by the university and city code due to potential safety hazards.[49] Adjacent to the main campus, Cornell owns the 2,800-acre (1,100 ha) Cornell Botanic Gardens, featuring various plants, trees, and ponds. The gardens' trails allow visitors to explore the natural surroundings.[50]\n\n\n\n#### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nCornell University has implemented various green initiatives to promote sustainability and reduce its environmental impact. Key projects include a gas-fired combined heat and power facility,[51] an on-campus hydroelectric plant,[52] and a lake source cooling system.[53] In 2007, Cornell established a Center for a Sustainable Future.[54] The university has committed to achieving net carbon neutrality by 2035[55] and, as of 2020, is powered by six solar farms providing a total of 28 megawatts of power.[56] Additionally, Cornell is developing an enhanced geothermal system, Earth Source Heating, to meet campus heating needs.[57]\n\n\n\n### New York City campuses[edit]\n\n\n#### Weill Cornell[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Weill Cornell Medicine\n\n![](image)Weill Medical Center on the East River of New York City's Upper East Side\nCornell's medical campus in New York City, also called Weill Cornell, is on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It is home to two Cornell divisions: Weill Cornell Medical College and Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, and has been affiliated with the New York-Presbyterian Hospital since 1927.[58] Although their faculty and academic divisions are separate, the Medical Center shares administrative and teaching hospital functions with the Columbia University Medical Center.[59] These teaching hospitals include the Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan and the Westchester Division in White Plains, New York.[60] Weill Cornell Medical College is also affiliated with the neighboring Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center, Rockefeller University, and the Hospital for Special Surgery. Many faculty members have joint appointments at these institutions. Weill Cornell, Rockefeller, and Memorial Sloan–Kettering offer the Tri-Institutional MD–PhD Program to selected entering Cornell medical students.[61] From 1942 to 1979, the campus also housed the Cornell School of Nursing.[62]\n\n\n\n#### Cornell Tech[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cornell Tech\n\n![](image)Cornell Tech in New York City, a graduate campus and research center.\nOn December 19, 2011, Cornell and the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology won a competition for rights to claim free city land and $100 million in subsidies to build an engineering campus in New York City. The competition was established by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to increase entrepreneurship and job growth in the city's technology sector. The winning bid consisted of a 2.1 million square foot state-of-the-art tech campus to be built on Roosevelt Island, on the site of the former Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital. Instruction began in the fall of 2012, in a temporary location at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan in space donated by Google.[63] Thom Mayne, of the architecture firm Morphosis, has been selected to design the first building to be constructed on Roosevelt Island. Begun in 2014, construction of the first phase of the campus was completed in September 2017.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Other New York City programs[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the tech campus and medical center, Cornell maintains local offices in New York City for some of its service programs. The Cornell Urban Scholars Program encourages students to pursue public service careers, arranging assignments with organizations working with New York City's poorest children, families, and communities.[65] The NYS College of Human Ecology and the NYS College of Agriculture and Life Sciences enable students to reach out to local communities by gardening and building with the Cornell Cooperative Extension.[66] Students with the NYS School of Industrial and Labor Relations' Extension and Outreach Program make workplace expertise available to organizations, union members, policymakers, and working adults.[67] The College of Engineering's Operations Research Manhattan, in the city's Financial District, brings together business optimization research and decision support services addressed to both financial applications and public health logistics planning.[68] The College of Architecture, Art, and Planning has an 11,000 square foot, Gensler-designed facility at 26 Broadway in the Financial District, that opened in 2015.[69]\n\n\n\n### Qatar campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar\n\nWeill Cornell Medical College in Qatar is in Education City, near Doha. Opened in September 2004, it was the first American medical school to be established outside of the United States. The college is part of Cornell's program to increase its international influence. The college is a joint initiative with the Qatar government, which seeks to improve the country's academic programs and medical care.[26] Along with its full four-year MD program, which mirrors the curriculum taught at Weill Medical College in New York City, the college offers a two-year undergraduate pre-medical program with a separate admissions process. This undergraduate program opened in September 2002 and was the first coeducational institute of higher education in Qatar.[70]\n\n\nThe college is partially funded by the Qatar government through the Qatar Foundation, which contributed $750 million for its construction.[71] The medical center is housed in a large two-story structure designed by Arata Isozaki, an internationally known Japanese architect.[72] In 2004, the Qatar Foundation announced the construction of a 350-bed Specialty Teaching Hospital, near the medical college in Education City. The hospital was to be completed in a few years.[26]\n\n\n\n### Other facilities[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences\n\n![](image)A World War I memorial on Cornell's West Campus in Ithaca\n![](image)Cornell's Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art designed by I. M. Pei\n![](image)The A.D. White Reading Room contains much of the 30,000 volume collection donated to the university by its co-founder and first president.\nCornell University owns and operates a variety of off-campus research facilities and offers study abroad and scholarship programs.[73] These facilities and programs contribute to the university's research endeavors and provide students with unique learning opportunities.\n\n\n\n#### Research facilities[edit]\n\n\nCornell's off-campus research facilities include Shoals Marine Laboratory, a seasonal marine field station on Appledore Island off the Maine–New Hampshire coast, is operated in conjunction with the University of New Hampshire and focuses on undergraduate education and research.[74] Until 2011, Cornell operated the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, which was the site of the world's largest single-dish radio telescope.[75]\n\n\nThe university also maintains several facilities dedicated to conservation and ecology, such as the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York. This station operates three substations, including the Cornell Lake Erie Research and Extension Laboratory in Portland,[76] the Hudson Valley Laboratory in Highland,[77] and the Long Island Horticultural Research Laboratory in Riverhead.[78] The Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca conducts research on biological diversity, primarily in birds,[79]\n\n\nOther research facilities include the Animal Science Teaching and Research Center, the Duck Research Laboratory, the Cornell Biological Field Station, the Freeville Organic Research Farm, the Homer C. Thompson Vegetable Research Farm, and biodiversity laboratories in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and the Peruvian Amazon Rainforest.[80][81][82][83][84][13]\n\n\n\n#### Study abroad and scholarship programs[edit]\n\n\nCornell offers various study abroad and scholarship programs that allow students to gain experience and earn credit towards their degrees. The \"Capital Semester\" program offers students the opportunity to intern in the New York State Legislature in Albany. The Cornell in Washington program enables students to spend a semester in Washington, D.C., participating in research or internships.[85] Similarly, the Cornell in Rome program, allows students to study architecture, urban studies, and the arts in Rome, Italy.[86]\n\n\n\n#### Cooperative extension service[edit]\n\n\nAs New York State's land-grant university, Cornell operates a cooperative extension service with 56 offices spread across the state. These offices provide programs in agriculture and food systems, children, youth and families, community and economic vitality, environment and natural resources, and nutrition and health.[87] Additionally, the university operates New York's Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which serves as a valuable resource for animal disease control and husbandry.[88]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| **College/school founding** |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| \n\n---\n\n |\n| Agriculture and Life Sciences | 1874\n |\n| Architecture, Art, and Planning | 1871\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | 1865\n |\n| Business | 1946\n |\n| Computing and Information Science | 2020\n |\n| Engineering | 1870\n |\n| Graduate School | 1909\n |\n| Hotel Administration | 1922\n |\n| Human Ecology | 1925\n |\n| Industrial and Labor Relations | 1945\n |\n| Law | 1887\n |\n| Medical Sciences | 1952\n |\n| Medicine | 1898\n |\n| Public Policy | 2021\n |\n| Tech | 2011\n |\n| Veterinary Medicine | 1894\n |\n\n\nCornell University is a non-profit organization with a decentralized structure where colleges and schools exercise wide autonomy in defining academic programs, admissions, advising, and conferring degrees. The university comprises nine privately endowed colleges and four publicly supported statutory colleges, offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs. Cornell operates eCornell for online professional development and certificate programs[89] and participates in New York's land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant programs.[90][91]\n\n\n\n### Governance and administration[edit]\n\n\nCornell University is governed by a 64-member board of trustees, which includes both privately and publicly appointed trustees. The board includes trustees appointed by the Governor of New York, alumni-elected trustees, faculty-elected trustees, student-elected trustees,[92] and non-academic staff-elected trustees. The Governor, Temporary President of the Senate, Speaker of the Assembly, and president of the university serve in an *ex officio* voting capacity. The board is responsible for electing a President to serve as the chief executive and educational officer.[93][94] Robert Harrison served as the chairman of the board from 2014 to 2022.[95] The Board of Trustees holds four regular meetings each year, subject to the New York State Open Meetings Law.[96] Kraig Kayser has served as the chairman of the board since 2022.\n\n\nMartha E. Pollack was inaugurated as Cornell's fourteenth president on August 25, 2017,[97][98] succeeding Elizabeth Garrett, who served from July 2015 until her death in March 2016.[99][100]\n\n\n\n### Colleges and academic structure[edit]\n\n\nCornell's colleges and schools offer a wide range of undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs. There are seven undergraduate colleges and seven schools offering graduate and professional programs. All academic departments at Cornell are affiliated with at least one college. A handful of inter-school academic departments offer courses in more than one college. Students pursuing graduate degrees in these schools are enrolled in the Graduate School. The School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions provides additional programs for college and high school students, professionals, and other adults.[101]\n\n\nCornell's statutory colleges include the New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, College of Human Ecology, School of Industrial and Labor Relations, and College of Veterinary Medicine. These colleges received $131.9 million in SUNY appropriations in 2010–2011 to support their teaching, research, and service missions, making them accountable to the State University of New York (SUNY) trustees and other state agencies.[102][103][104] New York residents enrolled in these colleges qualify for discounted tuition, however, their academic activities are considered by New York state to be private and non-state entities.[105]:1\n\n\nCornell's nine privately endowed, non-statutory colleges include the College of Arts and Sciences, College of Engineering, College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, and College of Hotel Administration. These colleges operate independently of state funding and oversight, giving them greater autonomy in determining their academic programs, admissions, and advising. They also do not offer discounted tuition for New York residents.\n\n\nOf the 15,182 undergraduate students at Cornell, 4,602 (30.3%) are affiliated with the largest college by enrollment, Arts and Sciences, followed by 3,203 (21.1%) in Engineering and 3,101 (20.4%) in Agriculture and Life Sciences. The smallest of the seven undergraduate colleges is Architecture, Art, and Planning, with 503 (3.3%) students.[4] The only university-wide requirements for a baccalaureate degree are to pass a swimming test, take two physical education courses, and satisfy a writing requirement. \n\n\n\n### Fundraising and financial support[edit]\n\n\nCornell University has a robust fundraising program, ranking third among U.S. universities in 2018 (behind Harvard and Stanford), collecting $743 million in private support.[106] Each college and program has its own staffed fundraising program, in addition to the central University development staff located in Ithaca and New York City.\n\n\nIn recent years, Cornell has been the recipient of several major donations that have enabled the university to expand its reach, create new programs, and drive advancements in education and research. Charles Feeney, founder of DFS Group, is Cornell's largest donor, having given one billion dollars to the university to fund numerous initiatives, including Cornell Tech, a cutting-edge technology-focused campus in New York City.[107] In 2017, the university also received a donation of $150 million from H. Fisk Johnson of S. C. Johnson & Son to create of the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business, the second largest ever gift to a business school.[108] Furthermore, the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future was established in 2010 following an $80 million donation from David Atkinson and his wife, Patricia.[109] In 2015, Joan and Irwin M. Jacobs, founder of Qualcomm, donated $133 million to fund the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech.[110] The Weill Cornell Medical College was founded thanks to a $100 million donation in 1998 from Citibank head Sanford I. Weill and his wife, Joan, with the Weills providing over $600 million in total lifetime donations to the university.[111]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\nCornell is a large, primarily residential research university with a majority of enrollments in undergraduate programs.[112] The university has been accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education or its predecessor since 1921.[113] Cornell operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall term beginning in late August and ending in early December, a three-week winter session in January, and the spring term beginning in late January and ending in early May.[114]\n\n\nCornell, along with Oregon State University, Pennsylvania State University, University of Georgia, and University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, are the only institutions to be land-grant universities that are also members of the other three \"grant\" programs: sea grant, space grant, and sun grant. Cornell is the only such private university.\n\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2022 enteringclass[115]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 6.9% |\n| Yield rate | 69% |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT EBRW | 700–760 |\n| SAT Math | 750–800 |\n| ACT Composite | 33–35 |\n| High school GPA[i] |\n| Top 10% | 83.7% |\n| Top 25% | 97.7% |\n| Top 50% | 99.9% |\n| 1. **^** Among students whose school ranked\n |\n\n\nAdmission to Cornell University is highly competitive. In spring of 2022 (Class of 2026), Cornell's undergraduate programs received 71,164 applications and admitted only 5,168 for a 7.2% acceptance rate.[116] For Fall 2019 enrolling freshmen, the middle 50% range of SAT scores were 680–760 for evidence-based reading and writing and 720–800 for mathematics.[117] The middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 32–35.[117]\n\n\nThe university continues to attract a diverse and inclusive student body. The proportion of admitted students who self-identify as underrepresented minorities increased to 34.2% from 33.7% in 2021, and 59.3% self-identify as students of color. That number has increased steadily over the past five years, enrollment officials said, from 52.5% in 2017 and 57.2% in 2020.\n\n\nOf those admitted, 1,163 will be first-generation college students, another increase over 2020's 844.[118] The university is need-blind for domestic applicants.[119]\n\n\n\n### Financial aid[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The sarcophagus in Sage Chapel of Jennie McGraw, a Cornell benefactor.\nCornell University, under Section 9 of its original charter, ensures equal access to education by admitting students without distinction based on rank, class, occupation, or locality.[120] The charter also mandates free instruction for one student from each Assembly district in the state.[120]\n\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1980s, Cornell collaborated with other Ivy League institutions to establish a uniform financial aid system.[121] Although a 1989 consent decree ended this collaboration due to an antitrust investigation, all Ivy League schools still offer need-based financial aid without athletic scholarships.[122] In December 2010, Cornell pledged to match any grant component of financial aid offers from other Ivy League schools, MIT, Duke, or Stanford for accepted applicants considering these institutions.[123]\n\n\nIn 2008, Cornell introduced a financial aid initiative, gradually replacing need-based loans with scholarships for undergraduate students from lower-income families.[124] Despite a 27% drop in the university's endowment in 2008, the then-president allocated additional funds to continue the initiative, seeking to raise $125 million in donations for its support.[125] By 2010, Cornell successfully met the full financial aid needs of 40% of full-time freshmen with financial need, and the average undergraduate student debt upon graduation was $21,549.[126]\n\n\n\n### International programs[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cornell South East Asia Program and Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar\n\n![](image)Cornell students performing a Raas, a traditional folk dance from India\nCornell is actively involved in fostering international cooperation and engagement through various academic programs, research collaborations, and global partnerships. As a member of the United Nations Academic Impact, the university aligns itself with the United Nations' goals and promotes international collaboration among institutions of higher education.\n\n\n\n#### Academic programs and study abroad opportunities[edit]\n\n\nCornell offers a wide range of undergraduate majors with an international focus, including Africana Studies, Asian-Pacific American Studies, French Studies, German Studies, Jewish Studies, Latino Studies, Near Eastern Studies, Romance Studies, and Russian Literature.[13] Students have the opportunity to study abroad on any of the six continents through various programs.[127]\n\n\nThe Asian Studies major, Southeast Asia Program, Southeast Asia Program, and China and Asia-Pacific Studies (CAPS) major provide opportunities for students and researchers focusing on Asia. Cornell has an agreement with Peking University, allowing CAPS students to spend a semester in Beijing.[128] Similarly, the College of Engineering exchanges faculty and graduate students with Tsinghua University in Beijing, while the School of Hotel Administration has a joint master's program with Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\n\nIn the Middle East, Cornell's efforts are centered on biology and medicine. The Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar trains new doctors to improve health services in the region.[129] The university is also involved in developing the Bridging the Rift Center, a \"Library of Life\" (or database of all living systems) on the border of Israel and Jordan, in collaboration with those two countries and Stanford University.[130]\n\n\nThe university also has agreements with several institutions around the world for student and faculty exchange programs, including Bocconi University, the University of Warwick, Japan's National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences,[131] the University of the Philippines Los Baños,[132] and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)1920 graduation ceremony\n#### Joint-degree programs[edit]\n\n\nCornell offers several joint-degree programs with international universities. The university is the only US member school in the CEMS Alliance, and its Master's in International Management program offers the CEMS Master's in International Management (CEMS MIM) as a double degree option. This enables students to study at one of 34 CEMS partner universities. Cornell has also partnered with Queen's University in Canada to offer a joint Executive MBA program.[134] Graduates of the program earn both a Cornell MBA and a Queen's MBA. Additionally, Cornell offers an international consulting course in association with the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, further emphasizing its commitment to international cooperation and education.[135]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[136] | 10 |\n| *Forbes*[137] | 12 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[138] | 12 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[139] | 8 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[140] | 11 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[141] | 12 |\n| *QS*[142] | 13 |\n| *THE*[143] | 20 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[144] | 21 |\n\n\nCornell University consistently ranks among the top institutions in various national and international rankings. Notable recent rankings include 7th in the US by QS World University Rankings and 9th by Times Higher Education World University Rankings.[145][146] The institution also garners praise for its contributions to research, community service, and social mobility, as well as its commitment to sustainability, as evidenced by its placement in The Washington Monthly and The Princeton Review's rankings.[147] In 2017, the university was ranked 7th in *The Princeton Review'*s \"Top 50 Green Colleges\".[148]\n\n\nIn its annual edition of \"America's Best Architecture & Design Schools\", the journal *Design Intelligence* has frequently ranked Cornell's Bachelor of Architecture program as number one in the nation (2000–2002, 2005–2007, 2009–2013, and 2015–2016). In the 2011 survey, the program ranked first and the Master of Architecture program ranked 6th.[149] In 2017, Design Intelligence ranked Cornell's Master of Landscape Architecture program 4th in the nation with the Bachelor of Science in Landscape Architecture program ranking 5th among its undergraduate counterparts.[150][151] Among business schools in the United States, the Johnson School of Management at Cornell was named the 9th best business school by *Forbes* in 2019,[152] 8th by *The Washington Post* for salary potential, 13th overall by *Poets and Quants* in 2020[153] but 4th for investment banking[154] and 6th for salary worldwide in 2015,[155] 11th nationally by *Bloomberg Businessweek* in 2019,[156] and 11th nationally and 14th worldwide by *The Economist* in 2019.[157] In 2013, the Johnson school was ranked 2nd for sustainability by *Bloomberg Businessweek*.[158]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cornell's 2008 commencement ceremony at Schoellkopf Field\nCornell's international relations offerings are also ranked in *Foreign Policy* magazine's Inside the Ivory Tower survey, which lists the world's top 20 international relations programs at the undergraduate, Master's, and Ph.D. levels.[159] In 2012, the survey ranked Cornell 11th overall for doctoral programs and 12th overall in the undergraduate category.[160] In 2015, Cornell was ranked third in New York State by average professor salaries.[161]\n\n\n\n### Library[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cornell University Library\n\n![](image)The Cornell Law Library is one of 12 national depositories for print records of briefs filed with the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Cornell University Library is the 11th largest academic library in the United States, ranked by number of volumes held.[162] Organized into 20 divisions, in 2005 it held 7.5 million printed volumes in open stacks, 8.2 million microfilms and microfiches, and a total of 440,000 maps, motion pictures, DVDs, sound recordings, and computer files in its collections, in addition to extensive digital resources and the University Archives.[163] It was the first among all U.S. colleges and universities to allow undergraduates to borrow books from its libraries.[13] In 2006, *The Princeton Review* ranked it as the 11th best college library,[164] and it climbed to 6th best in 2009.[165] The library plays an active role in furthering online archiving of scientific and historical documents. arXiv, an e-print archive created at Los Alamos National Laboratory by Paul Ginsparg, is operated and primarily funded by Cornell as part of the library's services. The archive has changed the way many physicists and mathematicians communicate, making the e-print a viable and popular means of announcing new research.[166]\n\n\n\n### Press and scholarly publications[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cornell University Press\n\nCornell University Press, established in 1869 but inactive from 1884 to 1930, was the first university publishing enterprise in the United States.[167][168] Today, the press is one of the country's largest university presses.[13] It produces approximately 150 nonfiction titles each year in various disciplines including anthropology, Asian studies, biological sciences, classics, history, industrial relations, literary criticism and theory, natural history, politics and international relations, veterinary science, and women's studies.[168][169]\n\n\nCornell's academic units and student groups also publish a number of scholarly journals. Faculty-led publications include the Johnson School's *Administrative Science Quarterly*,[170] the ILR School's *Industrial and Labor Relations Review*, the Arts and Sciences Philosophy Department's *The Philosophical Review*, the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning's *Journal of Architecture*, and the Law School's *Journal of Empirical Legal Studies*.[171] Student-led scholarly publications include the *Law Review*, the Cornell Institute for Public Affairs' *Cornell Policy Review*, the *International Law Journal*, the *Journal of Law and Public Policy*, the *International Affairs Review*, and the *HR Review*. *Physical Review*, recognized internationally as among the best and well known journals of physics, was founded at Cornell in 1893 before being later managed by the American Physical Society.\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cornell's Center for Advanced Computing was one of the five original centers of the NSF's Supercomputer Centers Program.\n![](image)Cornell Botanic Gardens, located adjacent to the Ithaca campus, is used for conservation research and for recreation by Cornellians\n![](image)In the basement of Goldwin Smith Hall, researchers in the Dendrochronology Lab determine the age of archaeological artifacts found at archeological digs.\nCornell University is a prominent research institution, classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[172] In the 2016–17 fiscal year, the university spent $984.5 million on research, with federal sources contributing the largest share of research funding at $438.2 million.[173] The Department of Health and Human Services and the National Science Foundation are the primary federal investors, accounting for 49.6% and 24.4% of all federal investments, respectively.[174] Cornell is ranked fourth in the world for producing graduates who pursue PhDs in engineering or natural sciences at American institutions and fifth for graduates pursuing PhDs in any field.[175]\n\n\n\n### Science, technology, and engineering research[edit]\n\n\nCornell has a rich history of scientific, technological, and engineering research accomplishments. The university has made significant contributions to the fields of nuclear physics, high-energy physics, space exploration, automotive safety, and computing technology, among others. Cornell consistently ranks among the top U.S. universities for patent acquisition and start-up company formation.[176] In the 2004–05 academic year, the university filed 203 U.S. patent applications, completed 77 commercial license agreements, and distributed royalties of more than $4.1 million to Cornell units and inventors.[13] In 2009 Cornell spent $671 million on science and engineering research and development, the 16th highest in the United States.[177]\n\n\nCornell has been involved in uncrewed missions to Mars since 1962[178] and played a vital role in the Mars Exploration Rover Mission in the 21st century.[179] The university's researchers discovered the rings around the planet Uranus[180] and operated the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico until 2011. This observatory housed the world's largest single-dish radio telescope at the time.[181]\n\n\nThe Automotive Crash Injury Research Project, begun in 1952, was a pioneering effort in crash testing and significantly improved vehicle safety standards.[182] It was the first to use corpses instead of dummies for testing, leading to crucial findings about the effectiveness of seat belts, energy-absorbing steering wheels, padded dashboards, and improved door locks.[182]\n\n\nCornell has long been at the forefront of advancements in computing technology. In the 1980s, the university deployed the first IBM 3090-400VF and coupled two IBM 3090-600E systems to investigate coarse-grained parallel computing. As part of the National Science Foundation's initiative to establish new supercomputer centers, the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing was founded. Cornell has continued to innovate in this area, most recently deploying Red Cloud, a cloud computing service designed specifically for research. The Red Cloud service is now part of the NSF's Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) supercomputing program.[183]\n\n\nIn the realm of high-energy physics, Cornell scientists have been researching fundamental particles for over 75 years. The university has played an integral role in the foundations of nuclear physics, with faculty members such as Hans Bethe and others participating in the Manhattan Project. In the 1930s, Cornell built the second cyclotron in the United States and, in the 1950s, became the first to study synchrotron radiation. The Cornell Electron Storage Ring, located beneath Alumni Field, was once the world's highest-luminosity electron-positron collider.[184][185] Cornell's accelerator and high-energy physics groups are involved in the design of the proposed International Linear Collider, which will complement the Large Hadron Collider and shed light on questions related to dark matter and the existence of extra dimensions.[186]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[187] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 35%\n | 35 |\n| Asian | 21%\n | 21 |\n| Hispanic | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Other[c] | 13%\n | 13 |\n| Foreign national | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[d] | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Affluent[e] | 84%\n | 84 |\n\n\n### Activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Interior windows of Barton Hall, an on-campus field house\n![](image)Fuertes Observatory on Cornell North Campus\nFor the 2016–2017 academic year, Cornell had over 1,000 registered student organizations. These clubs and organizations run the gamut from kayaking to full-armor jousting, from varsity and club sports and a cappella groups to improvisational theatre, from political clubs and publications to chess and video game clubs.[188] The Cornell International Affairs Society sends over 100 Cornellians to collegiate Model United Nations conferences across North America and hosts the Cornell Model United Nations Conference each spring for over 500 high school students. The Cornell University Mock Trial Association regularly sends teams to the national championship and is ranked 5th in the nation.[189] Additionally, the Cornell International Affairs Society's traveling Model United Nations team is ranked number 16 in the nation.[190] Cornell United Religious Work is a collaboration among many diverse religious traditions, helping to provide spiritual resources throughout a student's time at college. The Cornell Catholic Community is the largest Catholic student organization on campus. Student organizations also include a myriad of groups including a symphony orchestra,[191] concert bands,[192] formal and informal choral groups,[193] including the Sherwoods, the Chordials[194] and other musical groups that play everything from classical, jazz, to ethnic styles in addition to the Big Red Marching Band, which performs regularly at football games and other campus events.[195]\n\n\nOrganized in 1868, the oldest Cornell student organization is the Cornell University Glee Club.[196] Apart from musical groups, Cornell has an active outdoor community, consisting of Cornell Outdoor Education, Cornell Outing Club Archived 20 December 2018 at the Wayback Machine, and Outdoor Odyssey, a student-run group that runs pre-orientation trips for first-year and transfer students. A Cornell student organization, The Cornell Astronomical Society, runs public observing nights every Friday evening at the Fuertes Observatory. The university is home to the Telluride House, an intellectual residential society. The university is also home to three secret honor societies called Sphinx Head,[197] Der Hexenkreis and Quill and Dagger[198][199] that have maintained a presence on campus for well over 120 years.\n\n\nCornell's clubs are primarily subsidized financially by the Student Assembly and the Graduate & Professional Student Assembly, two student-run organizations with a collective budget of $3.0 million per year.[200][201] The assemblies also finance other student life programs including a concert commission and an on-campus theater.\n\n\n\n### Greek life, professional, and honor societies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Cornell University fraternities and sororities\n\nCornell hosts a large[202][203][204][205][206] fraternity and sorority system, with 70 chapters involving 33% of male and 24% of female undergraduates.[207][208][209] Cornell's Greek Life has an extensive history on the campus with the first fraternity, Zeta Psi, being chartered by the end of the university's first year.[210] Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek organization established for African Americans, was founded at Cornell in 1906.[211][212] Alpha Zeta fraternity, the first Greek-lettered organization established for Latin Americans in the United States, was also founded at Cornell on January 1, 1890. Alpha Zeta served the wealthy international Latin American students that came to the United States to study. This organization led a movement of fraternities that catered to international Latin American students that was active from 1890 to 1975.[213] On 19 February 1982, La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda fraternity was established;[214] it would eventually become the only Latino based fraternity in the nation with chapters at every Ivy League institution.[215] Latinas Promoviendo Comunidad/Lambda Pi Chi sorority was established on 16 April 1988, making the organization the first Latina-Based, and not Latina-exclusive, sorority founded at an ivy-league institution.[216]\n\n\nCornell's connection to national Greek life is strong and longstanding. Many chapters are among the oldest of their respective national organizations, as evidenced by the proliferation of *Alpha-series* chapters. The chapter house of Alpha Delta Phi constructed in 1877 is believed to be the first house built in America solely for fraternity use, and the chapter's current home was designed by John Russell Pope.[217] Philanthropy opportunities are used to encourage community relations, for example, during the 2004–05 academic year, the Greek system contributed 21,668 community service and advocacy hours and raised $176,547 in charitable contributions from its philanthropic efforts.[208] Generally, discipline is managed internally by the inter-Greek governing boards. As with all student, faculty or staff misconduct, more serious cases are reviewed by the Judicial Administrator, who administers Cornell's justice system.[208]\n\n\n\n### Press and radio[edit]\n\n\nThe Cornell student body produces several works by way of print and radio. Student-run newspapers include *The Cornell Daily Sun*, an independent daily; *The Cornell Review*, a conservative newspaper published fortnightly; and *The Cornell Progressive*, a liberal newspaper published monthly.\n\n\nOther press outlets include *The Cornell Lunatic*, a campus humor magazine; the *Cornell Chronicle*, the university's newspaper of record; and *Kitsch Magazine*, a feature magazine published in cooperation with Ithaca College. *The Cornellian* is an independent student organization that organizes, arranges, produces, edits, and publishes the yearbook of the same name; it is composed of artistic photos of the campus, student life, and athletics, and the standard senior portraits. It carries the Silver Crown Award for Journalism and a Benjamin Franklin Award for Print Design – the only Ivy League Yearbook with such a distinction.[218] Cornellians are represented over the radio waves on WVBR-FM, an independent commercial FM radio station owned and operated by Cornell students. Other student groups also operate internet streaming audio sites.[219]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of several footbridges that span Cornell's gorges and ease commuting from housing to academic buildings on campus\nUniversity housing is broadly divided into three sections: North Campus, West Campus, and Collegetown. Cornell began experiments with co-ed dormitories in 1971 and continued the tradition of residential advisors (RAs) within the campus system. In 1991, new students could be found throughout West Campus, including at the historic Baker and Boldt Hall complexes; since a 1997 residential initiative, West Campus houses transfer and returning students, whereas North Campus is almost entirely populated by freshmen as well as sorority and fraternity houses.[220]\n\n\nOptions for living on North Campus for upperclassmen include program houses and co-op houses. Program houses include Risley Residential College, Just About Music, the Ecology House, Holland International Living Center, the Multicultural Living Learning Unit, the Latino Living Center, Akwe:kon, and Ujamaa. The co-op houses on North are The Prospect of Whitby, Triphammer Cooperative, Wait Avenue Cooperative, Wari Cooperative, and Wait Terrace.[221] On West Campus, there are three university-affiliated cooperatives, 660 Stewart Cooperative, Von Cramm Hall, and Watermargin, and one independent cooperative, Cayuga Lodge. In an attempt to create a sense of community and an atmosphere of education outside the classroom and continue Andrew Dickson White's vision, a $250 million reconstruction of West Campus created residential colleges there for undergraduates.[222] The idea of building a house system can be attributed in part to the success of Risley Residential College, the oldest continually operating residential college at Cornell.[223] In 2018, Cornell announced its North Campus Residential Expansive project. By 2022, the university aims to add 2,000 beds on North Campus. Five new dorms and a dining hall will be created, three of which will be located in Appel Field and will be exclusive for freshmen. Sophomores will have two new dorms located in the current CC Parking Lot.[224]\n\n\nCornell has several housing areas for graduate and professional students. Of these, Schuyler House, which was formerly a part of Sage Infirmary,[225] has a dorm layout. Maplewood Apartments, Hasbrouck Apartments, and Thurston Court Apartments are apartment-style, some even allowing for family living. Off campus, many single-family houses in the East Hill neighborhoods adjacent to the university have been converted to apartments. Private developers have also built several multi-story apartment complexes in the Collegetown neighborhood. Nine percent of undergraduate students reside in fraternity and sorority houses, although first semester freshmen are not permitted to join them.[226] Cornell's Greek system has 67 chapters and over 54 Greek residences that house approximately 1,500 students. About 42% of Greek members live in their houses.[227] Housing cooperatives or other independent living units exist, including Telluride House, the Center for Jewish Living, Phillips House (located on North Campus, 1975 all women; 2016, all men), and Center for World Community (international community, off campus, formed by Annabel Taylor Hall, 1972, mixed gender).[228] The cooperative houses on North include The Prospect of Whitby, Triphammer Cooperative, Wait Avenue Cooperative, Wari Cooperative, and Wait Terrace.[221] On West Campus, there are three university-affiliated cooperatives, 660 Stewart Cooperative, Von Cramm Cooperative Hall, and \"Watermargin\"., and one independent cooperative, \"Cayuga Lodge\". Besides this, there exists also cooperative housing not owned by Cornell, like Gamma Alpha or Stewart Little.\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], Cornell's dining system was ranked fourth in the nation by The Princeton Review.[229] The university has 29 on-campus dining locations, including 10 \"All You Care to Eat\" cafeterias.[230] North Campus is home to 3 of these dining halls: Morrison Dining (located by Morrison Hall), North Star Dining Room (located in the Appel Commons), and Risley Dining (located in Risley Hall).[230] West Campus houses 6 dining halls, 5 of which accompany the West Campus residential houses: Cook House Dining Room, Becker House Dining Room, Rose House Dining Room, Jansen's Dining Room at Hans Bethe House, and Keeton House Dining Room.[230] Also located on West Campus is 104West!, a kosher/multicultural dining room.[230] Central Campus accommodates just a single dining hall: Okenshields, located in Willard Straight Hall.[230]\n\n\n\nVarious Cornell housing facilities\n![](image)\nBaker Dormitories\n![](image)\nBalch Hall\n![](image)\nHans Bethe House\n![](image)\nRisley Hall\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cornell Big Red\n\n![](image)A 1908 print depicting a Cornell Big Red baseball player\nCornell has 35[231] varsity intercollegiate teams that have the nickname of the Big Red. An NCAA division I institution, Cornell is a member of the Ivy League and ECAC Hockey and competes in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), the largest athletic conference in North America.[232] (ECAC Hockey is no longer affiliated with the ECAC.) Cornell's varsity athletic teams consistently challenge for NCAA Division I titles in a number of sports, including men's wrestling, men's lacrosse, men's ice hockey, and rowing (the women's crew program is subject to the NCAA, while the men's rowing program is governed by its own administrative body, the Intercollegiate Rowing Association). Under the Ivy League athletic agreement, the university does not offer athletic scholarships for athletic recruiting.[233]\n\n\nCornell's football team had at least a share of the national championship four times before 1940[234][235] and has won the Ivy League championship three times, last in 1990.[236]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Cornell men's basketball team appeared for the first time in the NCAA tournament's East Regional semifinals, known as the \"Sweet 16\". It was the first Ivy League team to make the semifinals since 1979.[237]\n\n\n\n### Cornell Outdoor Education[edit]\n\n\nCornell runs one of the largest collegiate outdoor education programs in the country, serving over 20,000 people every year. The program runs over 130 different courses including but not limited to: Backpacking and Camping, Mountain Biking, Bike Touring, Caving, Hiking, Rock and Ice Climbing, Wilderness First Aid, and tree climbing.[238] COE also oversees one of the largest student-run pre-freshman summer programs, known as Outdoor Odyssey.[239] Most classes are often entirely taught by paid student instructors and courses count toward Cornell's physical education graduation requirement.[240]\n\n\nOne notable facility at Cornell Outdoor Education is the Lindseth Climbing Wall. The wall was renovated in 2016, and now includes 8,000 square feet of climbing surface up from 4,800 square feet previously.[241] The new wall now offers a more modern environment with bouldering, top-rope, and lead climbing facilities appropriate for various skill levels.[242]\n\n\n\n### Cornelliana[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cornelliana\n\n![](image)A tradition started in 1901, Dragon Day celebrates a feat by freshman architecture students to construct a colossal dragon that is paraded to center campus and then burned.\n![](image)An ivy-covered emblem of Ezra Cornell circumscribed by the university motto\nCornelliana is a term for Cornell's traditions, legends, and lore. Cornellian traditions include Slope Day, a celebration held on the last day of classes of the spring semester, and Dragon Day, which includes the burning of a dragon built by architecture students. Dragon Day is one of the school's oldest traditions and has been celebrated annually since 1901, typically on or near St. Patrick's Day. The dragon is built secretly by the architecture students, and taunting messages are left for the engineering students for the week before Dragon Day. On Dragon Day, the dragon is paraded across the Arts Quad and then set afire.[243]\n\n\nAccording to legend, if a virgin crosses the Arts Quad at midnight, the statues of Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White will walk off their pedestals, meet in the center of the Quad, and shake hands, congratulating themselves on the chastity of students. There is also another myth that if a couple crosses the suspension bridge on North Campus, and the young woman does not accept a kiss from her partner, the bridge will fall. If the kiss is accepted, the couple is assured a long future together.[244]\n\n\nThe university is also host to various student pranks. For example, on at least two different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7 m) tall McGraw clock tower—once a 60-pound (27 kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery.[245] The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day.[246] The clock tower also plays music.\n\n\nThe school colors are carnelian (a shade of red) and white, a play on \"Cornellian\" and Andrew Dickson White. A bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the mascot \"Touchdown\" in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games.[8] The university's alma mater is \"Far Above Cayuga's Waters\", and its fight song is \"Give My Regards to Davy\". People associated with the university are called \"Cornellians\".\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nCornell offers a variety of professional and peer counseling services to students.[247] Formerly called Gannett Health Services until its name change in 2016, Cornell Health offers on-campus outpatient health services with emergency services and residential treatment provided by Cayuga Medical Center.[248] For most of its history, Cornell provided residential medical care for sick students, including at the historic Sage Infirmary.[249] Cornell offers specialized reproductive health and family planning services.[250] The university also has a student-run Emergency Medical Service (EMS) agency. The squad provides emergency response to medical emergencies on the campus at Cornell and surrounding university-owned properties. Cornell EMS also provides stand-by service for university events and provides CPR, First Aid and other training seminars to the Cornell community.[251]\n\n\nThe university received attention for a series of six student suicides by jumping into a gorge that occurred during the 2009–10 school year, and after the incidents added temporary fences to the bridges which span area gorges.[252] In May 2013, Cornell indicated that it planned to set up nets, which will extend out 15 feet, on five of the university's bridges.[253] Installation of the nets began in May 2013 and were completed over the summer of that year.[252] There were cases of gorge-jumping in the 1970s and 1990s.[254] Before this abnormal cluster of suicides, the suicide rate at Cornell had been similar to or below the suicide rates of other American universities, including a period between 2005 and 2008 in which no suicides occurred.[255][256]\n\n\n\n### Campus police[edit]\n\n\nCornell University Police protect the campus and are classified as peace officers and have the same authority as the Ithaca city police. They are similar to the campus police at Ithaca College, Syracuse University, and University of Rochester because those campus police are classified as armed peace officers. The Cornell University Police are on campus and on-call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Their duties include: patrolling the university around the clock, responding to emergencies and non-emergency calls for service, crime prevention services, active investigation of crimes on campus, enforcement of state criminal and motor vehicle laws, and campus regulations.[257][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Cornell University\n\nCornell counts numerous notable individuals who have either come to the university as faculty to teach and to conduct research, or as students who have gone on to do noteworthy things. As of October 2023, 62 Nobel laureates were either faculty members, researchers, or students at Cornell.[14]\n\n\n\n### Faculty[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Cornell University faculty.\n\n![](image)Cornell University's 1916 faculty\nAs of 2009[update], Cornell had 1,639 full-and part-time faculty members affiliated with its main campus,[13] 1,235 affiliated with its New York City divisions, and 34 affiliated with its campus in Qatar.[13] Cornell's faculty for the 2005–06 academic year included three Nobel laureates, a Crafoord Prize winner, two Turing Award winners, a Fields Medal winner, two Legion of Honor recipients, a World Food Prize winner, an Andrei Sakharov Prize winner, three National Medal of Science winners, two Wolf Prize winners, five MacArthur award winners, four Pulitzer Prize winners, a Carter G. Woodson Scholars Medallion recipient, 20 National Science Foundation career grant holders, a recipient of the National Academy of Sciences Award, a recipient of the American Mathematical Society's Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement, a recipient of the Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics, and three Packard Foundation grant holders.[13]\n\n\nKurt Lewin taught at Cornell from 1933 to 1935 and is considered the \"father of social psychology\".[258] Norman Borlaug taught at the university from 1982 to 1988 and is considered the \"father of the Green Revolution\",[259] being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and 49 honorary doctorates.[260] Frances Perkins joined the Cornell faculty in 1952 after serving as the first female member of the United States Cabinet and served until her death in 1965. Perkins was a witness to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in her adolescence and went on to champion the National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the Social Security Act while United States Secretary of Labor. Buckminster Fuller was a visiting professor at Cornell for one year (1952),[261] and Henry Louis Gates, African American Studies scholar and subject of an arrest controversy and White House \"Beer Summit\", taught at Cornell from 1985 to 1989.[262] Plant genetics pioneer Ray Wu invented the first method for sequencing DNA, considered a major breakthrough in genetics as it has enabled researchers to more closely understand how genes work.[263][264] Emmy Award-winning actor John Cleese, known for his roles in *Monty Python*, *James Bond*, *Harry Potter* and *Shrek*, has taught at Cornell since 1999.[265] Charles Evans Hughes taught in the law school from 1893 to 1895 before becoming Governor of New York, United States Secretary of State, and Chief Justice of the United States.[266] Georgios Papanikolaou, who taught at Cornell's medical school from 1913 to 1961, invented the Pap smear test for cervical cancer.[267] Robert C. Baker ('43), widely credited for inventing the chicken nugget, taught at Cornell from 1957 to 1989. Carl Sagan was a professor at the university from 1968 to 1996.[268] He narrated and co-wrote the PBS series *Cosmos*, the Emmy Award- and Peabody Award-winning show that became the most watched series in public-television history.
