It is the sequel to *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017) and *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. It stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei, Andrew Garfield, and Tobey Maguire. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) to use magic to make his identity as Spider-Man a secret again following its public revelation at the end of *Far From Home*. When the spell is corrupted because of Parker's actions, the multiverse is broken open, which allows visitors from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe.\n\n\nA third MCU Spider-Man film was planned during the production of *Homecoming* in 2017. Negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter their deal—in which they produce the Spider-Man films together—ended with Marvel Studios leaving the project in August 2019, but a negative fan reaction led to a new deal between the companies a month later. Watts, McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return, and filming took place from October 2020 to March 2021 in New York City and Atlanta. *No Way Home* serves as a crossover between the MCU and the *Spider-Man* films directed by Sam Raimi and Marc Webb, featuring several actors reprising their roles from those films, including previous Spider-Man actors Maguire and Garfield. The involvement of both actors was the subject of wide speculation and numerous leaks despite the efforts of Sony, Marvel, and the cast to conceal their involvement.\n\n\n*Spider-Man: No Way Home* premiered at the Fox Village Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on December 13, 2021, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 17, as part of Phase Four of the MCU. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $1.9 billion worldwide, surpassing its predecessor as the highest-grossing film released by Sony Pictures. It became the highest-grossing film of 2021, the sixth-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest grossing Spider-Man film, and set several other box office records, including those for films released during the COVID-19 pandemic. The film received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 94th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. An extended version of the film, subtitled *The More Fun Stuff Version*, had a global theatrical release in September 2022. A sequel is in development.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nAfter Quentin Beck frames Peter Parker for his murder and reveals Peter's identity as Spider-Man,[a] Peter, his girlfriend Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson, best friend Ned Leeds, and his aunt, May Parker are interrogated by the Department of Damage Control. Lawyer Matt Murdock gets Peter's charges dropped, but the group grapples with negative publicity. \n\n\nAfter Peter, MJ, and Ned's MIT applications are rejected, Peter goes to the New York Sanctum to ask Stephen Strange for help. Strange starts casting a spell that would make everyone forget Peter is Spider-Man, but it is corrupted when Peter repeatedly requests alterations to let his loved ones retain their memories, ultimately causing Strange to contain the spell to stop it.\n\n\nAt Strange's suggestion, Peter tries to convince an MIT administrator to reconsider the applications of MJ and Ned, but is attacked by Otto Octavius. Octavius rips nanotechnology from Peter's Iron Spider suit, which bonds with his mechanical tentacles and allows Peter to control them. As Norman Osborn arrives and attacks, Strange teleports Peter back to the Sanctum and locks Octavius in a cell next to Curt Connors. \n\n\nStrange explains that the corrupted spell summoned people from other universes within the multiverse who know Spider-Man's identity. He orders Peter, MJ, and Ned to find and capture them; they locate and retrieve Max Dillon and Flint Marko at a military research facility.\n\n\nOsborn reclaims control of himself from his split Green Goblin personality and destroys the Goblin mask. He goes to a F.E.A.S.T. building, where May comforts him before Peter retrieves him. While discussing their battles with their versions of Spider-Man, Osborn, Octavius, and Dillon realize they were pulled from their universes sometime before their deaths.[b]\n\n\nStrange prepares to reverse the contained spell and send the villains back to their respective universes, but Peter argues that they should first cure the villains of the insanity that would lead to their deaths, to possibly change their fates upon their return. When Strange refuses, Peter steals the spell, traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension, and, with May, takes the villains to Happy Hogan's apartment, where he uses Stark Industries technology to cure Octavius. \n\n\nBefore Peter can cure anyone else, his spider-sense goes off. He then realizes that the Goblin persona has retaken control of Osborn, who convinces the uncured villains to betray Peter. As Dillon, Marko, and Connors escape, the Goblin fatally injures May. Before she dies, May tells Peter that \"with great power, there must also come great responsibility\".\n\n\nNed discovers that he can create portals using Strange's sling ring, which he and MJ use to try to locate Peter. They instead find alternate versions of Peter from the villains' universes who were also summoned by Strange's spell and who are nicknamed \"Peter-Two\" and \"Peter-Three\". The group finds this universe's Peter, nicknamed \"Peter-One\", who is ready to give up and send the villains home to die. The alternate Peters share stories of losing loved ones and encourage Peter-One to fight in May's honor, and the three Peters develop cures for the villains.\n\n\nThe group lure Dillon, Marko, and Connors to the Statue of Liberty. Peter-One and Peter-Two cure Connors and Marko, while Octavius arrives to help cure Dillon, and Ned frees Strange from the Mirror Dimension. The Goblin appears and unleashes the contained spell, which breaks apart the barriers between universes, pulling in countless others who know Parker's identity. \n\n\nStrange attempts to hold them off while an enraged Peter-One tries to kill the Goblin. Peter-Two stops him, but gets stabbed by the Goblin. Peter-Three helps Peter-One inject the Goblin with his cure, restoring Osborn's sanity. Peter-One realizes that the only way to protect the multiverse is to erase himself from everyone's memory and requests Strange to do so, while promising MJ and Ned that he will find them again. Strange reluctantly casts the spell, and everyone returns to their respective universes—including Eddie Brock,[c] who unknowingly leaves behind a piece of the Venom symbiote.\n\n\nTwo weeks later, Peter visits MJ to reintroduce himself to her and Ned, but he decides against it. While mourning at May's grave, he has a conversation with Hogan and is inspired to carry on, making a new suit and resuming his vigilantism.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAndrew Garfield (top) and Tobey Maguire (bottom) return as their respective versions of Spider-Man from previous film franchises. Their involvement was kept secret by Marvel and Sony despite fan speculation and leaks before the film's premiere.\n\n* Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:  \nA teenager and Avenger who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[5] The film explores the fallout of *Spider-Man: Far From Home*'s (2019) mid-credits scene, in which Parker's identity as Spider-Man is exposed,[6] and Parker is more pessimistic in contrast to previous Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films. Holland said Parker feels defeated and insecure and was excited to explore the darker side of the character.[7] The adjustment back to portraying Parker, including raising his voice pitch and returning to the mindset of a \"naïve, charming teenager\", was strange for Holland after taking on more mature roles such as in *Cherry* (2021).[8]\n* Zendaya as Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson:  \nParker's classmate and girlfriend.[9][10][11] The character's full name is revealed in the film, having previously just been known as Michelle Jones, bringing her closer to the comics counterpart Mary Jane Watson.[10]\n* Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange:  \nA neurosurgeon who became a Master of the Mystic Arts following a career-ending car accident.[12][13] Holland felt Strange was not a mentor to Parker, unlike Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark in *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017), but instead saw them as colleagues and noted their relationship breaks down throughout the course of the film.[14] Cumberbatch felt there was a close relationship between Strange and Parker because both are neighborhood superheroes with a shared history.[15] Co-writer Chris McKenna described Strange as the voice of reason in the film.[16]\n* Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds: Parker's best friend.[17][10] Batalon lost 102 pounds (46 kg) for his role in this film.[18]\n* Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan: The head of security for Stark Industries and former driver and bodyguard of Tony Stark, who looks after Parker.[19]\n* Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon / Electro:  \nAn Oscorp electrical engineer from an alternate reality who gained electric powers after an accident involving genetically modified electric eels. Foxx reprises his role from Marc Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* (2014).[17][20] The character was redesigned for *No Way Home*, foregoing his original blue Ultimate Marvel-based design in favor of a yellow one more similar to his mainstream comic book appearance.[21]\n* Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin:  \nA scientist and the CEO of Oscorp from an alternate reality who tested an unstable strength enhancer on himself. He developed an insane split personality as a result and uses advanced Oscorp armor and equipment. Dafoe reprises his role from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy.[22] Dafoe felt Green Goblin had advanced from his portrayal in *Spider-Man* (2002) and had \"a few more tricks up [his] sleeves\" in this film.[23] Dafoe was digitally de-aged for the role,[24] and the character also obtains upgrades to his costume to make him more closely resemble his comic book counterpart.[23]\n* Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus:  \nA scientist from an alternate reality with four artificially intelligent mechanical tentacles fused to his body after an accident. Molina reprises his role from Raimi's *Spider-Man 2* (2004),[25] with this film continuing from the character's story prior to his death in that film. Molina was surprised by this approach because he had aged in the years since he made that film; digital de-aging was also used to make him look physically the same as in *Spider-Man 2*.[26] The mechanical tentacles were created completely through CGI, rather than blending them with puppetry as in *Spider-Man 2*.[27][24]\n* Benedict Wong as Wong: Strange's mentor and friend who became the new Sorcerer Supreme during Strange's absence in the Blip.[28][19]\n* Tony Revolori as Eugene \"Flash\" Thompson: Parker's classmate and former rival.[29]\n* Marisa Tomei as May Parker:  \nParker's aunt.[30] While developing the story, the writers realized that May would play a role similar to Uncle Ben's role in other incarnations of Spider-Man. As such, the thematic and often-paraphrasingly-quoted idiom \"with great power, there must also come great responsibility\" is said by May, since she has been the \"moral guide\" for Parker in the MCU.[31]\n* Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:  \nAn alternate version of Parker who is haunted by his failure to save his deceased girlfriend, Gwen Stacy.[32][31] Garfield reprises his role from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* films.[33][34] The other Spider-Men refer to him as \"Peter-Three\",[35] while Marvel's official website named him \"The Amazing Spider-Man\".[36] Garfield embraced his role as the middle brother of the group and was interested in exploring the idea of a tortured Parker following the events of *The Amazing Spider-Man 2*, including how lessons from those events could be passed to Holland's character.[31] He was grateful for the chance to \"tie up some loose ends\" for his incarnation of Parker, and described working with Holland and Maguire as an opportunity to have \"deeper conversations... about our experiences with the character\".[37] Parker ends up saving MJ during the climax in a similar way to how he fails to save Stacy in *The Amazing Spider-Man 2*; McKenna and co-writer Erik Sommers credited director Jon Watts for coming up with the idea while they watched a pre-visualization reel showcasing ideas for the climactic battle.[16]\n* Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:  \nAn alternate version of Parker who utilizes organic webbing instead of web shooters like his alternate counterparts.[38] Maguire reprises his role from Raimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy.[33][34] The other Spider-Men refer to him as \"Peter-Two\",[35] while Marvel's official website named him the \"Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man\".[36] Maguire wanted the film to reveal only minimal details about what happened to his character after the events of *Spider-Man 3* (2007).[31]\n\n\nRhys Ifans reprises his role as Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard, an Oscorp scientist from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* (2012) who transformed into a large reptilian monster while trying to regrow his missing arm. Thomas Haden Church reprises his role as Flint Marko / Sandman, a small-time thief from Raimi's *Spider-Man 3* who received an ability to transform into sand.[22] Both Ifans and Church returned to voice the characters, though footage at the end of the film when they revert to their human forms was archival footage from *The Amazing Spider-Man* and *Spider-Man 3*, respectively.[39] Watts served as a stand-in for Church on-set by providing motion-capture reference to the uncredited body double who physically replaced Church in the role.[40] Charlie Cox reprises his role as Matt Murdock from Marvel Television's Netflix series,[41] and Tom Hardy reprises his roles as Eddie Brock / Venom from Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) in an uncredited cameo appearance in the mid-credits scene.[42]\n\n\nReprising their roles from previous MCU *Spider-Man* films are Angourie Rice as Betty Brant, Parker's classmate and Ned's ex-girlfriend;[43] Hannibal Buress as Coach Wilson, Midtown School of Science and Technology's gym teacher;[44] Martin Starr as Roger Harrington, Parker's academic decathlon teacher;[45] J. B. Smoove as Julius Dell, Parker's teacher;[46] J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the host of *The Daily Bugle*;[47][48] and Gary Weeks as Department of Damage Control (DODC) agent Foster.[49] Jake Gyllenhaal appears as Quentin Beck / Mysterio via archive footage from *Far From Home*.[50] Also appearing in the film are Paula Newsome as an MIT administrator,[45] Arian Moayed as DODC agent Cleary,[50] Mary Rivera as Ned's grandmother,[45] and Cristo Fernández as a bartender serving Brock.[42] Tom Holland's brother Harry Holland was set to make a cameo as a thief, but his scenes were cut from the original theatrical release.[51] Lexi Rabe, who portrayed Stark's daughter Morgan in *Avengers: Endgame* (2019), also had an appearance that was not included in the theatrical release.[52]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lead actor Tom Holland and director Jon Watts in 2016\nDuring production on *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017), two sequels were being planned by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures.[53] In June 2017, star Tom Holland explained that each film would take place during a different year of high school for Peter Parker / Spider-Man, with the third being set during the character's senior year.[54] Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige noted in July 2019 that the third film would feature \"a Peter Parker story that has never been done before on film\" due to the ending of the second film, *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019), which publicly reveals that Parker is Spider-Man.[55]\n\n\nDevelopment on third and fourth MCU Spider-Man films had begun by August 2019, with Sony hoping Holland and director Jon Watts would return for both;[56] Holland was contracted to return for one more film, while Watts had completed his two-film deal and would need to sign on for any more films.[57][58] By then, Marvel Studios and its parent company The Walt Disney Studios had spent several months discussing expanding their deal with Sony. The existing deal had Marvel and Feige produce the Spider-Man films for Sony and receive 5% of their revenue. Sony wanted to expand the deal to include more films while keeping the same terms of the original agreement. Disney expressed concern with Feige's workload producing the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchise already and asked for a 25–50% stake in any future films Feige produced for Sony.[56][59][58] Unable to come to an agreement, Sony announced that it would be moving forward on the next Spider-Man film without Feige or Marvel's involvement. Their statement acknowledged that this could change in the future, thanked Feige for his work on the first two films, and said they appreciated \"the path [Feige] has helped put us on, which we will continue.\"[59] Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers were writing the screenplay for the third film by the time of Sony's announcement, after also doing so for *Far From Home*, but Watts was receiving offers to direct large films for other studios instead of returning to the franchise, including potentially working on a different property for Marvel Studios and Feige.[58]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman Tony Vinciquerra said that \"for the moment the door is closed\" on Spider-Man returning to the MCU, and confirmed that the character would be integrated with Sony's own shared universe—Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU)—moving forward. Responding to backlash from fans following the announcement, Vinciquerra added that \"the Marvel people are terrific people, we have great respect for them, but on the other hand we have some pretty terrific people of our own. [Feige] didn't do all the work ... we're pretty capable of doing what we have to do here.\"[60] However, after this fan reaction continued at Disney's biennial convention D23, and at the urging of Holland who personally spoke to Disney CEO Bob Iger and Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group chairman Tom Rothman,[61] the companies returned to negotiations.[62] Sony and Disney announced a new agreement at the end of September which would allow Marvel Studios and Feige to produce another MCU Spider-Man film for Sony with Amy Pascal, scheduled for July 16, 2021.[5] Disney was reportedly co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of its profits, while retaining the character's merchandising rights.[5][62] Feige said he was \"thrilled\" that the character would remain in the MCU and said \"all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working\" on the franchise. The agreement also allowed Holland's Spider-Man to appear in a future Marvel Studios film as well as crossing over to Sony's own shared universe,[5] with the latter interaction described as \"a 'call and answer' between the two franchises as they acknowledge details between the two in what would loosely be described as a shared detailed universe\". Sony described their previous films with Marvel Studios as a \"great collaboration\", and said \"our mutual desire to continue was equal to that of the many fans.\"[62] At the time of the new agreement, Watts was in final negotiations to direct the film.[63]\n\n\nDiscussing the new deal in October, Iger attributed it to the efforts of Holland as well as the fan response to the end of the original deal. He felt that both Sony and Disney had initially forgotten that \"there are other people who actually matter\" while they were negotiating.[64] Rothman said the deal was a \"win-win-win. A win for Sony, a win for Disney, a win for the fans.\" He felt the initial reports on the negotiations did not necessarily line up with the actual discussions that were taking place, and said the final deal would have eventuated without the reports and fan discourse.[65] Zendaya was confirmed to be reprising her role as MJ from the previous films in the sequel.[9]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nMcKenna and Sommers began working on the script in earnest by December 2019.[31][16] They considered featuring Kraven the Hunter as the film's main antagonist,[31] an idea that Watts had expressed interest in and pitched to Holland,[66][67] before gravitating towards a story idea similar to *It's a Wonderful Life* (1946) in which Parker makes a wish regarding his now public identity. That idea introduced Dr. Stephen Strange to the story, and the duo began exploring the idea of the multiverse and potentially revisiting characters from past *Spider-Man* films. Initially they thought this would just be a tease for fans but they ultimately decided to fully integrate the past characters into the plot. Sommers said, \"Once it was collectively decided that we were going to take this swing, we had to commit and we had to do what was right for the story.\" They optimistically wrote for all the characters they wanted in the film before those actors were confirmed to be returning.[31] Initial drafts of the film included every major character from past *Spider-Man* films returning, but this was narrowed down because the pair felt they had \"bit[ten] off more than [they] could chew\". The duo worked hard to prevent the film from just being \"a bunch of fan service\" by using the returning characters to help tell Peter Parker's story instead of just creating \"curtain calls for everybody\".[16] Norman Osborn / Green Goblin from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy was not the main villain of the film in the first version of the script, despite still appearing as an antagonist; after the film lost \"other characters\", McKenna and Sommers concluded that the Green Goblin \"had to be\" the main villain and rewrote the script to give him a second chance to replicate his actions in *Spider-Man* (2002), but in a darker way related to Holland's version of Spider-Man.[68] America Chavez had been considered to appear in the film at one point to serve in the sorcerer's apprentice-type role that eventually became part of Ned Leeds's role in the film; she would go on to appear in *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (2022).[69]\n\n\nBy the end of 2019, filming was expected to begin in mid-2020.[70] In April 2020, Sony rescheduled *No Way Home*'s release to November 5, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[71] Although the film was originally meant to be set after the events of *Multiverse of Madness*, release date changes meant *No Way Home* would be released first which meant aspects of the plot had to be rewritten,[72] including Strange no longer having firsthand knowledge of the multiverse. McKenna felt this made it \"even more frightening, to start fooling around with these things, because it's the fear of the unknown\".[16] In June, Marisa Tomei confirmed that she would return as May Parker along with Watts as director. She was hopeful that May's work as a community organizer would be featured in the film.[30] Also in June, Charlie Cox, who portrayed Matt Murdock / Daredevil in Marvel Television's Netflix series, was contacted by Feige about reprising his role in upcoming Marvel Studios projects starting with appearances in *No Way Home* and the Disney+ series *She-Hulk: Attorney at Law*.[73][74] The next month, Holland said production was planned to take place from late 2020 to February 2021,[75] and Sony shifted the film's release date to December 17, 2021.[76] Tony Revolori was also confirmed to be reprising his role as Flash Thompson.[29] In early October, Jacob Batalon and Benedict Cumberbatch were set to reprise their MCU roles of Ned Leeds and Strange, while Jamie Foxx was set to return as Max Dillon / Electro from Marc Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* (2014), with filming beginning later in the month.[17][12] Immediately prior to the beginning of filming, several other key actors in the film had yet to sign on. According to Holland, the film needed \"all or none\" of the actors in order to be produced.[72]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSecond unit filming occurred from October 14 to 16, 2020, in New York City,[77][78][79] under the working title *Serenity Now*,[80][78] to capture visual effects plates and establishing shots.[77] Filming occurred in the Astoria, Sunnyside, and Long Island City neighborhoods in Queens.[81][79] On October 23, filming occurred in Greenwich Village in Manhattan.[82]\n\n\nThe production moved to Atlanta by October 25, with Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya joining for principal photography,[83][84] after Holland finished shooting Sony's *Uncharted* (2022) two days earlier.[85][77][86] Mauro Fiore served as cinematographer on the film,[87] replacing Seamus McGarvey,[88] who had to leave the production after contracting COVID-19. McGarvey also had a conflict with the film *Cyrano* (2021) following *No Way Home*'s pandemic-caused production delay,[89] as principal photography was originally planned to start in July 2020.[90][91][75] Shooting in Atlanta occurred at Trilith Studios, with strict safety measures in place on the soundstages to prevent exposure to COVID-19.[92] To reduce interactions between cast and crew members on set during the pandemic, the production reportedly relied on \"innovative new technology\" that scanned actors into a visual effects system that can apply make-up and costumes to actors during post-production.[93] A light system was also in-place to signal when the cast could take off their masks for filming and when masks would be required for the cast and crew members to wear while set work was being done.[94] Cumberbatch began shooting his scenes in Atlanta by late November, before beginning work on *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* which began filming that month in London.[95][96] Filming ran for seven-to-eight weeks using the working titles *Serenity Now* and *The November Project*, before a break during the 2020 Christmas season.[97][86][98]\n\n\nBy December 2020, Alfred Molina was set to reprise his role as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man 2* (2004),[25] with Tobey Maguire reprising his role as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy and Andrew Garfield returning as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* films.[31] A cameo appearance of Maguire and Garfield alongside Holland as their respective Spider-Men had previously been considered for the Sony Pictures Animation film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* (2018), but was cut then because Sony felt at that moment that it would be too risky and confusing.[99] At that time, *Collider* reported that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film alongside Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson from Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy from the *Amazing Spider-Man* films.[100] The first draft of the script included other characters from the *Spider-Man* and *Amazing Spider-Man* films, but the writers felt that including too many characters would negatively affect the story.[16] The rumors about returning actors led to speculation and commentary, with Richard Newby of *The Hollywood Reporter* believing that a crossover-style film could \"lessen the impact\" of Sony's successful animated *Into the Spider-Verse* film.[101] His colleague Graeme McMillan felt a \"Spider-Verse\" crossover would allow Marvel to \"clean up some loose ends ... and fulfill some fan dreams in the process\", especially if Marvel and Sony's negotiations meant that they wanted to separate Spider-Man from the MCU.[102] */Film*'s Hoai-Tran Bui feared the film was becoming over-crowded and wished that Holland could lead a Spider-Man film without a \"bigger A-list star showing him the ropes\",[103] while Adam B. Vary of *Variety* noted that these reports were not confirmed and questioned whether the returning actors would be making more than cameo appearances.[104] Shortly after, Holland denied that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film.[86] Many of the actors returning from previous *Spider-Man* films were brought to set in cloaks in order to help prevent their involvements in the film from leaking.[105] Around Christmas 2020, McKenna and Sommers rewrote the introductions of Maguire and Garfield as well as much of the third act in time for those actors to start filming. They had not been able to focus on those scenes earlier because they were busy during filming of much of the first and second acts in the previous months.[16]\n\n\nFeige confirmed in December 2020 that the film would have connections to *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness*.[106] A month later he discussed the fact that the film's title had not yet been announced, acknowledging that it was being referred to by some as *Spider-Man 3* and revealing that Marvel was referring to it as *Homecoming 3* internally.[107] Cox had shot material for the film by then.[41] An Atlanta set photo indicated that the film would be set during the Christmas season.[108] Filming occurred at Frederick Douglass High School from January 22 to 24.[109][*additional citation(s) needed*] The next month, Holland described it as \"the most ambitious standalone superhero\" film,[97] and again denied the rumors that Maguire and Garfield would appear.[110][8] At the end of February, the film's title was revealed to be *Spider-Man: No Way Home*, continuing the naming convention of the past two films of featuring \"home\" in the title.[111] Filming took place at Midtown High School from March 19 to 21.[109][112] The Atlanta Public Schools system had stopped allowing buildings in the district for use as filming locations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but gave this film an exception since both the Frederick Douglass and Midtown schools were previously used as filming locations in *Spider-Man: Homecoming*.[109] Hannibal Buress was revealed to be reprising his role as gym teacher Coach Wilson,[112] with Buress releasing a music video in August 2021 revealing that he had filmed scenes in Atlanta.[44] Holland said *No Way Home* had more \"visceral\" fight sequences than the previous two films, with more hand-to-hand combat.[27] Filming wrapped on March 26, 2021.[113][114]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nActors reprising their roles from earlier *Spider-Man* films include Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx as Electro, Thomas Haden Church as Sandman, Rhys Ifans as Lizard, and J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.\n\nIn April 2021, Molina confirmed that he was appearing in the film, explaining that he had been told not to talk about his role in the film during production but he realized that his appearance had been widely rumored and reported on.[26] Later that month, J. B. Smoove revealed that he was returning as Julius Dell from *Far From Home*,[46] while Cox stated that he was not involved with the film.[115] In early May, Garfield denied that he had been asked to appear in the film, but later said \"never say never\",[116][117] while Angourie Rice was revealed to be returning as Betty Brant.[43] Later that month, Stone denied her involvement in the film.[118]\n\n\nSony Pictures Group President Sanford Panitch acknowledged in May that there had been confusion and frustration from fans regarding the relationship between the SSU and the MCU, but stated that there was a plan to clarify this. He believed it was already \"getting a little more clear for people [as to] where we're headed\" at that time and added that the release of *No Way Home* would reveal more of this plan. Vary commented that the apparent introduction of multiverse elements in *No Way Home* could be what would allow Holland to appear in both the MCU and the SSU.[119] The official trailer for *No Way Home* confirmed the involvements of Jon Favreau as Harold \"Happy\" Hogan and Benedict Wong as Wong, reprising their roles from past MCU films,[19] as well as J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson from *Far From Home* (Simmons previously played a different version of the character in the Raimi trilogy as well).[47] It was also confirmed that the characters Electro and Green Goblin would appear in the film,[19][20][120] with the implication that this incarnation of Green Goblin would be Willem Dafoe's version from the Raimi films.[120] In September 2021, Garfield again denied he was in the film, saying, \"No matter what I say... it's either going to be really disappointing for people or it's going to be really exciting\".[121] Garfield later described his denials as \"rather stressful but also weirdly enjoyable\".[122]\n\n\nIn early October, many commentators expected Tom Hardy to reprise his roles as Eddie Brock and Venom from *Venom* (2018) and *Venom: Let There Be Carnage* (2021), after the *Let There Be Carnage* mid-credits scene showed the characters being transported from their universe (the SSU) to the MCU.[123][124][125] Feige said there was a lot of coordination between the *Let There Be Carnage* and *No Way Home* teams to create the scene,[126] which was directed by Watts during the production of *No Way Home*.[16] Hardy ultimately appeared as Brock in the film's mid-credits scene,[42] though there had been discussions about integrating him into the film's final battle.[16] Later that month, *Empire*'s issue on *No Way Home* stated that the film would include the returns of Doctor Octopus, Electro, Dafoe's Green Goblin, Thomas Haden Church's Flint Marko / Sandman from Raimi's *Spider-Man 3* (2007), and Rhys Ifans's Curt Connors / Lizard from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* (2012).[127] Watts said these were still unconfirmed rumors and was in \"no hurry to confirm or deny appearances\" of the characters,[127] while Feige said the rumors were fun for fans but audiences should not expect them all to come true.[128] The film's second trailer confirmed the involvements of Dafoe, Church, and Ifans.[22]\n\n\nAt the beginning of November, Jorge Lendeborg Jr. revealed that he would be reprising his role as Jason Ionello from *Homecoming* and *Far From Home* in a similar role to those films that would have \"very little to do with the core\" story.[129] By the middle of the month, additional photography had been completed for the film.[130] Pascal described *No Way Home* as \"the culmination of the *Homecoming* trilogy\",[131] and Arian Moayed revealed that he had a role in the film.[132] Dunst said she was not in the film,[133] but would \"never say no\" to reprising her role of Mary Jane Watson.[134] A teaser trailer for *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* was included at the end of the film as a post-credits scene,[135] before being released online shortly after *No Way Home*'s theatrical release.[136]\n\n\nJeffrey Ford and Leigh Folsom Boyd served as the film's editors.[137] The visual effects were provided by Cinesite, Clear Angle Studios, Crafty Apes, Digital Domain, Folks VFX, Framestore, Luma Pictures, Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies, Mr. X, Perception, Secret Lab, Sony Pictures Imageworks, and SSVFX.[138]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (soundtrack)\n\nIn November 2020, *Homecoming* and *Far From Home* composer Michael Giacchino was confirmed to be returning for *No Way Home*.[139][140] The film's score album was released digitally on December 17, 2021, with a track titled \"Arachnoverture\" released as a single on December 9 and another titled \"Exit Through the Lobby\" released the following day.[141] Giacchino references themes from previous *Spider-Man* films by Hans Zimmer, James Horner, Christopher Young,[142] and Danny Elfman, as well as his own themes from *Doctor Strange* (2016).[143] Regarding the use of these other themes, Giacchino did not want their use to be fan service and finding ways to include them in a \"very targeted\" way. He and Watts were \"very much in alignment in terms of when to use them and when not to use them for their maximum effect\".[144]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Sony entered a promotional partnership with Hyundai Motor Group to showcase their new models and technologies in the film;[145] Hyundai later released a commercial, titled \"Only Way Home\", that was directed by Watts to promote the film and the Ioniq 5 electric-powered SUV (which appears in the film along with the Hyundai Tucson), with Holland and Batalon starring.[146] In late February 2021, Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya released three stills featuring their characters from the film alongside fake logos with the titles *Spider-Man: Phone Home*, *Spider-Man: Home-Wrecker*, and *Spider-Man: Home Slice*, respectively.[147] The film's official title was announced the next day with a video showing Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya leaving Watts's office (where they supposedly received the fake titles). Batalon and Zendaya note that Holland could not be trusted with the actual title since he had \"accidentally\" revealed the second film's title. The video ends on a whiteboard showing the film's true title, among various other titles featuring the word \"home\" that were apparently considered.[111] Jennifer Bisset of *CNET* suggested the fake titles and logos could represent the villains in the film, including Foxx's Electro and Molina's Doctor Octopus,[147] while *TheWrap*'s Umberto Gonzalez called them funny \"bait-and-switch fakes\", and noted the *Phone Home* title referenced a line from *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982).[148] Gregory Lawrence of *Collider* felt the *Home-Wrecker* title could point to the film feeling like a 1990s thriller film, and said the fake titles were a \"solid goof\" to excite fans. He also compared the stills to the \"terrifying/awe-inspiring wonder\" of Steven Spielberg films and *The Goonies* (1985),[149] while Germain Lussier from *io9* said they gave off \"subtle *National Treasure*, *Indiana Jones* vibes\".[150] In July 2021, Marvel revealed various toys and figurines for the film, including Funko Pops, Marvel Legends figures, and Lego sets.[151]\n\n\nAt the end of August 2021, when asked about the lack of trailer and official images or descriptions for the film, Feige stated that the film was not being \"any more or less secret than any of our other projects\" and reaffirmed that a trailer would be released before the film's premiere in theaters.[152] Though Sony handles the marketing for the film, their marketing team is in coordination with Disney's to ensure each knows when the other is releasing MCU-related content so it is a \"win-win for everybody\".[153] On August 22, an apparent leak of the first trailer was shared on social media,[154][155][156] which *The Hollywood Reporter* deemed \"legitimate\" after Sony worked to have various copies of the trailer taken down.[154] Adam Chitwood at *Collider* noted the built up online \"fervor\" surrounding the trailer and felt that it would not be able to \"live up to the hype fans have built up in their minds\". Chitwood continued that the other 2021 film releases from Marvel Studios had not seen a similar level of demand as *No Way Home*, pointing out that all of the rumored castings had positioned the film to be a \"once-in-a-lifetime moviegoing experience\" if they were accurate. He also wondered if Sony was wary of committing marketing that noted the film's December 2021 release date amid the resurgence of the COVID-19 Delta variant.[157]\n\n\nThe film's teaser trailer was officially released on August 23 during Sony's CinemaCon 2021 panel.[20] *Entertainment Weekly*'s Devan Coggan noted that the trailer confirmed the multiverse's role in the film, including elements from the Raimi and Webb films,[6] while Ethan Anderton from */Film* called the trailer \"nothing short of thrilling\" since it confirmed many of the previous rumors about the film.[158] Austen Goslin at *Polygon* conversely felt much of what had been rumored did not get revealed in the trailer, feeling that the rumors were either false or Marvel was still intending to keep them a secret.[159] Anderton's colleague Joshua Meyer called the trailer \"a doozy... packed with jaw-dropping moments\" and noted how the film would be adapting the \"One More Day\" comic book storyline;[160] Newby had previously noted the apparent adaption of \"One More Day\" and \"One Moment in Time\" storylines following the reveal of Cumberbatch's casting.[101] Many commentators noted the possible teases of Spider-Man villains Sandman and the Lizard in the trailer as an indication of the Sinister Six forming in the film.[47][120][161] Vinnie Mancuso at *Collider* was excited to see the return of Molina and the potential for Dafoe's involvement, but called it a \"cheap pop\" since it was doing \"a disservice to the stories you're trying to tell in the present by reminding the audience how much better things used to be\". He also felt the trailer played into \"Marvel's ongoing reluctance to let Tom Holland's Spider-Man star in his own Spider-Man movies\" since the trailer gave Parker \"zero memorable moments\" amongst all of its elements.[162] The trailer had 355.5 million global views in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period. This surpassed the record of *Avengers: Endgame* (289 million views) and more than doubled the views for the *Spider-Man: Far From Home* trailer (135 million). It also generated the largest 24-hour social media conversation volume of all-time globally with 4.5 million mentions, made up of 2.91 million in the United States, and 1.5 million internationally; these both exceeded *Avengers: Endgame*'s mentions (1.94 million in the United States, 1.38 million internationally).[163]\n\n\nThe second official trailer premiered at a fan screening at the Regal Sherman Oaks theater in Los Angeles on November 16, 2021.[164] Goslin felt the trailer \"reveals the full extent of Marvel's Spider-Man multiverse\",[165] while his colleague Matt Patches noted the missing appearance of Maguire's or Garfield's Spider-Man in the trailer but felt that it was \"entirely possible the actors appear in *No Way Home*\".[166] Jason Robbins of *Collider* was disappointed by the trailer, saying it was \"what we expected, but less\", since it just showed the returning villains and had no confirmation of Maguire or Garfield or \"further insight into the multiverse\".[48] Some commentators said parts of the trailer appeared as though Maguire and Garfield had been edited out of the footage, such as a shot in which the Lizard appears to be struck by an invisible force.[167][168] On November 24, Sony began releasing several videos on TikTok as part of their *The Daily Bugle* viral marketing campaign featuring Simmons and Rice.[169] In December 2021, the first minute of the film premiered exclusively on *Late Night with Seth Meyers*,[170] while a newsstand for *The Daily Bugle* was set up in New York City in partnership with Liberty Mutual to promote the film.[171] Other marketing partners include the video games *Fortnite* and *PUBG Mobile*, which featured special in-game Spider-Man themed props and costumes, Asus, whose Republic of Gamers (ROG) laptop is used by Ned in the film, Xiaomi, iQOO, Continental AG, and Tampico Beverages. The film had a total promotional marketing value of $202 million.[172]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Spider-Man: No Way Home* had its world premiere at Fox Village Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on December 13, 2021.[173][174] The film was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland on December 15,[175] and in the United States on December 17, where it opened in 4,325 theaters including in IMAX and other premium large formats.[176] It was previously set for release on July 16, 2021,[5] but was pushed back to November 5,[71] before it was further shifted to the December 2021 date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[76] It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.[177]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Sony and CJ 4DPlex announced a deal to release 15 of Sony's films over three years in the ScreenX format, including *No Way Home*.[178] In November 2021, the film was reported to be getting a theatrical release in China, making it the first Phase Four film to do so as *Black Widow*, *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings*, and *Eternals* were not released in the country,[179] though as of February 2022[update], there is no release date,[180] in part because of diplomatic tensions between China and the United States,[181][180] including the U.S. diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.[181] Chinese authorities had requested for the Statue of Liberty to be removed from the film, which Sony refused.[182]\n\n\n\n#### *The More Fun Stuff Version*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Theatrical release poster for *The More Fun Stuff Version*. It was considered an improvement from the original poster since it featured all the characters previously kept secret with the marketing of the original release.[183][184][185]\nAn extended cut of the film, subtitled *The More Fun Stuff Version*, was announced in June 2022. The re-release celebrates 60 years of Spider-Man in comics and 20 years of Spider-Man in film,[186] and features approximately 13 minutes of additional and deleted scenes. The additions include: an introduction by Holland, Maguire, and Garfield; additional scenes of Parker and May being interrogated by the Department of Damage Control; the scene with Holland's brother Harry as a thief that was cut from the original release; *Daily Bugle* reports of Parker's first day back at school and the arrivals of Dillon and Marko; additional scenes of Parker at school; Brant interviewing Parker, his teachers, and his classmates; additional scenes in the basement of the New York Sanctum; a scene featuring May, Parker, and the villains in an elevator while on the way to Hogan's apartment; an additional scene with Murdock and Hogan; additional scenes of the three Parkers; and a new post-credits scene, replacing the *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* teaser trailer, which showcases the effects of Strange's second spell.[187]\n\n\n*The More Fun Stuff Version* was released in theaters beginning August 31, 2022, in Indonesia, followed by the United States and Canada, among other countries, on September 1, and later in a number of other markets through October 6.[188][189] The poster for the extended cut was considered an improvement from the original release's marketing, since it was able to feature all of the characters previously kept a secret leading up to the film's release.[183][184][185] Shrishty Mishra at *Collider* said it was an \"*Avengers*-style poster [with] a perfect blend of the multiverse feels, combined with the 'Where's Waldo' effect\".[183] Anthony Lund of *MovieWeb* called it an \"epic poster that [the fans] have been calling out for\".[190] *ComicBook.com*'s Russ Burlingame said the poster was what \"we've all been waiting for\" and \"a big change in the way [Sony] initially promoted the movie\" since they \"continued to play coy\" on the cameos after the film had released.[185]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External images |\n| --- |\n| ![image icon](image) of course, we got THE meme... presents the home media announcement tweet and 1960s TV series meme homage image from SpiderManMovie's Twitter |\n| ![image icon](image) The Spider-Man pointing meme, via The Origins of the Iconic 'Spider-Man' Pointing' Meme, Nerdist Industries |\n\n\n*Spider-Man: No Way Home* was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on digital download on March 15, 2022,[191] and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on April 12. Digitally, the film was also available in a three-film bundle including all of Marvel Studios' Spider-Man films, as well as an eight-film bundle including Holland, Maguire, and Garfield's films.[192] Sony moved the digital release up to March 15 from March 22, following Blu-ray versions of the film being leaked to torrent sites.[193][191] The home media includes a gag reel and various behind-the-scenes featurettes, including two roundtable discussions: one with Dafoe, Molina, and Foxx, and another with Holland, Maguire, and Garfield.[194] It has the most pre-release digital purchases on Vudu, surpassing the purchases for *Avengers: Endgame*. To announce the home media release dates, Sony and the film's social media accounts posted a photo of Holland, Maguire, and Garfield recreating a popular meme from the 1967 *Spider-Man* television series of multiple Spider-Men pointing at one another; the tweets of the image garnered more than 10,000 retweets within minutes of being posted.[195] Within its first week of release, the film sold over 2.1 million digital units in the United States, equaling $42 million; this was a record for a film's first week available on digital release.[196] It was also the highest-selling film on physical media for 2022 in the US according to The NPD Group.[197]\n\n\nThe film was released on Starz following its theatrical and home media releases, the last film released by Sony with an exclusive limited streaming video on demand (SVOD) release on Starz. Following films would be released on Netflix after their theatrical and home media releases, through 2026.[198][199] Additionally, Sony signed a deal with Disney in April 2021 giving the latter access to Sony's legacy content, including past Spider-Man films and Marvel content in the SSU, to stream on Disney+ and Hulu and appear on Disney's linear television networks. Disney's access to Sony's titles to be released from 2022 through 2026 would come following their availability on Netflix.[200][201] In February 2022, Sony expanded their pre-existing deal with WarnerMedia for making their films available on HBO Max and HBO across Central and Eastern Europe, which included *No Way Home*.[202] *The More Fun Stuff Version* was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on digital on October 18, 2022 as *Spider-Man: No Way Home – Extended Cut*,[203] when it also began streaming on Starz.[204]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Spider-Man: No Way Home* grossed $814.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.108 billion in other territories for a worldwide total of $1.922 billion.[3][4] It is the highest-grossing film of 2021,[205] the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time,[206] the third-highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada,[207] the highest-grossing *Spider-Man* film, and the highest-grossing film released by Sony.[208] *No Way Home* is also the first film since *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* (2019) to gross over $1 billion,[209] becoming the third-fastest to reach that milestone and the first to do so during the COVID-19 pandemic.[210] It surpassed *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* (2017) to become Sony Pictures' highest-grossing film in North America.[208] Based on a final projected worldwide gross of $1.75 billion (a figure that was surpassed), *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the film's final net profit at $610 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs versus box office grosses and home media revenues.[211] It returned the global revenue of Cineworld, the world's second-largest cinema operator, to 88% of 2019 levels.[212]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, *Spider-Man: No Way Home* earned $121.85 million (which included $50 million from its Thursday night previews) on its opening day, becoming the second-highest opening film after *Avengers: Endgame* ($157.4 million) and the highest-opening film for a December release. In its opening weekend, it grossed $260 million, surpassing *Avengers: Infinity War* ($257.7 million) to become the second-highest domestic box office opening of all time.[213] As of January 9, 2022[update], an estimated 54.4 million people have seen *Spider-Man: No Way Home* in theaters in the United States and Canada.[214] The film remained at the top of the box office for three additional weekends until it was dethroned in its fifth weekend by *Scream*.[215][216][214][217] In its sixth weekend of release, *Spider-Man: No Way Home* reclaimed the top spot at the box office.[218] The film once again held onto the number one spot in its seventh weekend of release.[219] In March 2022, the film surpassed $800 million in the United States and Canada, becoming the third film to do so after *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (2015) and *Avengers: Endgame*. Comscore Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian called the film \"arguably the most important movie to the movie theater industry ever\", as it helped show the viability of the movie theater industry and the benefit of theatrical release windows while the industry recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic.[196] The film dropped to the 11th spot on its 15th weekend.[220] *Spider-Man: No Way Home* returned to first place at the box office, earning $1.8 million on the first day of the release of *The More Fun Stuff Version*,[221] and went on to finish third with $6.5 million over the four-day Labor Day weekend, finishing behind *Top Gun: Maverick* and *Bullet Train*.[222] It was the highest opening weekend box office gross for a re-released MCU film, surpassing *Avengers: Endgame* ($5.5 million) and *Spider-Man: Far From Home* ($4 million).[223]\n\n\n*Spider-Man: No Way Home* earned $43.6 million from 15 markets on its opening day, with Sony holding the best opening-day record in South Korea, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Italy, and Taiwan. In South Korea, the film grossed $5.28 million on its opening day, thereby beating *Spider-Man: Far From Home*'s opening day in the country by over 11% and the biggest day-one figure for any film during the pandemic. In the United Kingdom, the film beat *No Time to Die*'s opening box office record at £7.6 million ($10.1 million).[224] In India, the film's box office on its opening day was ₹320 million (equivalent to ₹360 million or US$4.3 million in 2023) to ₹345 million (equivalent to ₹390 million or US$4.6 million in 2023), beating *Endgame* and the Indian film *Sooryavanshi* (2021).[225] In its five-day opening weekend, the film grossed $340.8 million from 60 markets.[226] In Latin America as of January 16, 2022, it became the all-time highest-grossing film in Mexico ($72 million), and the second all-time highest in Brazil ($50.4 million), Central America ($12.6 million) and Ecuador ($7.9 million).[227] As of February 27, 2022[update], the film's largest markets are the United Kingdom ($127.3 million), Mexico ($76.2 million), Australia ($67.9 million), France ($65.2 million), and South Korea ($63.1 million).[228]\n\n\n\n#### Pre-sale ticket records[edit]\n\n\nTickets went on sale the midnight of November 29, 2021, with several ticket websites such as Fandango and AMC Theatres crashing due to the high influx of users attempting to purchase tickets.[229] Ticket sales on Fandango surpassed those for *Black Widow* in just two hours, and by the end of the day it became the best first-day advance ticket sale since *Endgame*,[230] while also surpassing the 24-hour ticket sales of *Avengers: Infinity War*, *Star Wars: The Last Jedi* (2017), *Spider-Man: Far From Home*, *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* and *Rogue One* (2016).[231] *No Way Home* had the second-highest one-day ticket sales on AMC, with CEO Adam Aron attributing this to Spider-Man-themed non-fungible tokens (NFTs).[231]\n\n\nThe film also set records in Mexico with $7 million in the first-day ticket sale, which was 40% above *Endgame*. In the United Kingdom, the film outsold *No Time to Die* three times in the same twelve-day span before their release, while Brazil's ticket sale was 5% above *Endgame* at the same point. The film also passed the presale records of *The Rise of Skywalker* in Poland and *No Time to Die* in Portugal. Other markets with the best presale records include Spain, Brazil, and Central America.[232]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 93%, with an average score of 7.9/10, based on 430 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A bigger, bolder *Spider-Man* sequel, *No Way Home* expands the franchise's scope and stakes without losing sight of its humor and heart.\"[233] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 60 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[234] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the first live-action Spider-Man film and the fourth MCU film overall to earn the score after *The Avengers* (2012), *Black Panther* (2018), and *Avengers: Endgame*.[213] PostTrak reported 96% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 91% saying they would definitely recommend it.[213]\n\n\nAmelia Emberwing of *IGN* gave the film 8 out of 10, stating that its \"impact on the universe as a whole, as well as the overall emotional beats, all feel earned\" while praising the performances of Dafoe, Molina, and Foxx.[235] Pete Hammond of *Deadline Hollywood* praised Watts's direction and wrote, \"Holland, Zendaya, and Batalon are a priceless trio, and the various villains and 'others' who pop in and out make this pure movie fun of the highest order. Fans will be in heaven\".[236] Peter Debruge of *Variety* praised Garfield's and Maguire's performances and felt the film \"provides enough resolution for the past two decades of Spider-Man adventures that audiences who've tuned out along the way will be rewarded for giving this one a shot\".[33] Writing for *Den of Geek*, Don Kaye gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, for its action sequences, performances and chemistry of the cast, stating that \"*No Way Home* channels the entire spectrum of Spider-Man movies while setting the character on a course all his own at last\".[237] Jennifer Bisset of *CNET* praised the action sequences, performances, and story, writing: \"A Russo Brothers influence can almost be felt ushering Holland's third Spider-Man movie into new, weightier territory. If the character is to become the next Tony Stark, this is the way to etch a few more scars into a more interesting hero's facade. If you came for the biggest movie of the year, you'll definitely leave satisfied\".[238]\n\n\nKevin Maher of *The Times* gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, saying that it was \"As satisfying to watch as it is perilous to discuss\", and described it as \"a dynamite blast of smarty-pants postmodernism that never once abandons its emotional core.\"[239] Benjamin Lee of *The Guardian* gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, praising Watts for \"bringing back numerous baddies from the previous Spider-Man universes, delivering a propulsive, slickly choreographed adventure that will appease a broad fanbase this Christmas\" but feeling that the script \"lacks the expected fizz, that sense of shaggy fun struggling to break through a more robotic plot\".[240] Kate Erbland of *IndieWire* gave the film a \"B−\", feeling that Watts's work was \"satisfying, emotional, and occasionally unsteady\". She found that the script spent \"far too long dwelling on the machinations of people and plans we already know, throwing in some awkward misdirection and simply delaying the inevitable\".[241] *The Hollywood Reporter*'s John DeFore felt that the inclusion of \"multiversal mayhem\" addressed the \"Iron Man-ification of the character\" that made Holland-centric films \"least fun\".[242]\n\n\n*CNN*'s Brian Lowry praised the humor and wrote, \"What's already apparent, though, is that this movie was conceived to be savored and enjoyed. And in what has become an increasingly elusive phenomenon, that will include whoops and hollers from appreciative fans in theaters, where *Spider-Man* will first reveal its secrets, and then, more than likely, shows off its legs.\"[243] Richard Roeper of *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film 3 out of 4 and praised the performances of Holland and Zendaya, writing: \"There's nothing new or particularly memorable about the serviceable CGI and practical effects, but we remain invested in the outcome in large part because Holland remains the best of the cinematic Spider-Men, while Zendaya lends heart and smarts and warmth to every moment she's onscreen. We continue to root for these two to make it, even if the multiverse isn't always on their side.\"[244] In contrast, Bilge Ebiri of *Vulture* called the film \"aggressively mediocre\", criticizing the action, comedy and writing, but praising Dafoe – describing him as \"once again gets to have some modest fun with his character's divided self\" – and Garfield, calling him a \"genuine delight\" and naming his the film's best performance.[245] Hannah Strong of *Little White Lies* criticized the film for poor character development particularly in regard to Holland's Peter Parker character stating,\"It's grating seeing the same character repeatedly fail to learn any lessons or show even a modicum of personal growth\". The same review was also generally critical of the film prioritizing fan service over good storytelling.[246]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Spider-Man: No Way Home*\n\n*No Way Home* was nominated for an Academy Award,[247] three Visual Effects Society awards (winning one),[248][249] a Costume Designers Guild Award,[250] a Golden Reel Award,[251] three Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards (winning all),[252] five Critics' Choice Super Awards (winning three),[253][254] and nine Saturn Awards (winning one),[255] among others. The film was disqualified from consideration for the 75th British Academy Film Awards because it was not made available on BAFTA's streaming service, reportedly due to Sony being concerned about piracy.[256] As part of the ceremony's \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest, the three Spider-Men teaming up was one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment,[257] and the film was the favorite to win the \"Fan Favorite\" film contest according to a Morning Consult survey.[258] It ended up finishing second and fourth, respectively.[259]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nBy August 2019, a fourth film in the franchise was in development alongside *No Way Home*.[56] In February 2021, Holland said *No Way Home* was the final film under his contract but he hoped to continue playing Spider-Man in the future if asked.[260] That October, Holland said *No Way Home* was being treated as \"the end of a franchise\" that began with *Homecoming*, with any additional solo films featuring the MCU Spider-Man characters to be different from the first trilogy of films and feature a tonal change.[27] A month later, Holland said he was unsure if he should continue making Spider-Man films and felt he would have \"done something wrong\" if he was still portraying the character in his thirties. He expressed interest in a film focusing on the Miles Morales version of Spider-Man instead. Despite this, Pascal hoped to continue working with Holland on future Spider-Man films.[72] Later in November, Pascal said there were plans for another trilogy of Spider-Man films starring Holland, with work on the first of those about to begin,[131] though Sony did not yet have official plans for further MCU Spider-Man films.[261]\n\n\nFeige confirmed in December that he and Pascal, along with Sony and Disney, were actively beginning to develop the story for the next *Spider-Man* film following Parker's \"momentous decision\" in *No Way Home*. He promised that the partnership between Sony and Disney would not break down again as it did during the development of *No Way Home*.[262] In April 2022, following Watts' exit as director of Marvel Studios' *Fantastic Four* in order to take a break from blockbuster films, *Deadline Hollywood* reported that Sony still expected Watts (along with Holland and Zendaya) to eventually return for the next MCU *Spider-Man* film.[263] Feige said in February 2023 that they had a story for the film with \"big ideas\" and that writers had begun work on it.[264] Pascal said at the end of May that the film was still in development but that work was put on hold because of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike that began earlier that month, and that work would resume after the strike concluded.[265] By that time, Holland reiterated that the film was in early stages of development and that he had been involved in meetings about it, which were also put on hold because of the writers' strike.[266]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As depicted in *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019)\n2. **^** As depicted in *Spider-Man* (2002), *Spider-Man 2* (2004), and *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* (2014), respectively\n3. **^** Brock was teleported to the MCU by Strange's first spell as seen in the Sony's Spider-Man Universe film *Venom: Let There Be Carnage* (2021).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Spider-Man: No Way Home* (12A)\". *British Board of Film Classification*.

It is the sequel to *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017) and *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. It stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei, Andrew Garfield, and Tobey Maguire. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) to use magic to make his identity as Spider-Man a secret again following its public revelation at the end of *Far From Home*. When the spell is corrupted because of Parker's actions, the multiverse is broken open, which allows visitors from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe.\n\n\nA third MCU Spider-Man film was planned during the production of *Homecoming* in 2017. Negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter their deal—in which they produce the Spider-Man films together—ended with Marvel Studios leaving the project in August 2019, but a negative fan reaction led to a new deal between the companies a month later. Watts, McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return, and filming took place from October 2020 to March 2021 in New York City and Atlanta. *No Way Home* serves as a crossover between the MCU and the *Spider-Man* films directed by Sam Raimi and Marc Webb, featuring several actors reprising their roles from those films, including previous Spider-Man actors Maguire and Garfield. The involvement of both actors was the subject of wide speculation and numerous leaks despite the efforts of Sony, Marvel, and the cast to conceal their involvement.\n\n\n*Spider-Man: No Way Home* premiered at the Fox Village Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on December 13, 2021, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 17, as part of Phase Four of the MCU. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $1.9 billion worldwide, surpassing its predecessor as the highest-grossing film released by Sony Pictures. It became the highest-grossing film of 2021, the sixth-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest grossing Spider-Man film, and set several other box office records, including those for films released during the COVID-19 pandemic. The film received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 94th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. An extended version of the film, subtitled *The More Fun Stuff Version*, had a global theatrical release in September 2022. A sequel is in development.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nAfter Quentin Beck frames Peter Parker for his murder and reveals Peter's identity as Spider-Man,[a] Peter, his girlfriend Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson, best friend Ned Leeds, and his aunt, May Parker are interrogated by the Department of Damage Control. Lawyer Matt Murdock gets Peter's charges dropped, but the group grapples with negative publicity. \n\n\nAfter Peter, MJ, and Ned's MIT applications are rejected, Peter goes to the New York Sanctum to ask Stephen Strange for help. Strange starts casting a spell that would make everyone forget Peter is Spider-Man, but it is corrupted when Peter repeatedly requests alterations to let his loved ones retain their memories, ultimately causing Strange to contain the spell to stop it.\n\n\nAt Strange's suggestion, Peter tries to convince an MIT administrator to reconsider the applications of MJ and Ned, but is attacked by Otto Octavius. Octavius rips nanotechnology from Peter's Iron Spider suit, which bonds with his mechanical tentacles and allows Peter to control them. As Norman Osborn arrives and attacks, Strange teleports Peter back to the Sanctum and locks Octavius in a cell next to Curt Connors. \n\n\nStrange explains that the corrupted spell summoned people from other universes within the multiverse who know Spider-Man's identity. He orders Peter, MJ, and Ned to find and capture them; they locate and retrieve Max Dillon and Flint Marko at a military research facility.\n\n\nOsborn reclaims control of himself from his split Green Goblin personality and destroys the Goblin mask. He goes to a F.E.A.S.T. building, where May comforts him before Peter retrieves him. While discussing their battles with their versions of Spider-Man, Osborn, Octavius, and Dillon realize they were pulled from their universes sometime before their deaths.[b]\n\n\nStrange prepares to reverse the contained spell and send the villains back to their respective universes, but Peter argues that they should first cure the villains of the insanity that would lead to their deaths, to possibly change their fates upon their return. When Strange refuses, Peter steals the spell, traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension, and, with May, takes the villains to Happy Hogan's apartment, where he uses Stark Industries technology to cure Octavius. \n\n\nBefore Peter can cure anyone else, his spider-sense goes off. He then realizes that the Goblin persona has retaken control of Osborn, who convinces the uncured villains to betray Peter. As Dillon, Marko, and Connors escape, the Goblin fatally injures May. Before she dies, May tells Peter that \"with great power, there must also come great responsibility\".\n\n\nNed discovers that he can create portals using Strange's sling ring, which he and MJ use to try to locate Peter. They instead find alternate versions of Peter from the villains' universes who were also summoned by Strange's spell and who are nicknamed \"Peter-Two\" and \"Peter-Three\". The group finds this universe's Peter, nicknamed \"Peter-One\", who is ready to give up and send the villains home to die. The alternate Peters share stories of losing loved ones and encourage Peter-One to fight in May's honor, and the three Peters develop cures for the villains.\n\n\nThe group lure Dillon, Marko, and Connors to the Statue of Liberty. Peter-One and Peter-Two cure Connors and Marko, while Octavius arrives to help cure Dillon, and Ned frees Strange from the Mirror Dimension. The Goblin appears and unleashes the contained spell, which breaks apart the barriers between universes, pulling in countless others who know Parker's identity. \n\n\nStrange attempts to hold them off while an enraged Peter-One tries to kill the Goblin. Peter-Two stops him, but gets stabbed by the Goblin. Peter-Three helps Peter-One inject the Goblin with his cure, restoring Osborn's sanity. Peter-One realizes that the only way to protect the multiverse is to erase himself from everyone's memory and requests Strange to do so, while promising MJ and Ned that he will find them again. Strange reluctantly casts the spell, and everyone returns to their respective universes—including Eddie Brock,[c] who unknowingly leaves behind a piece of the Venom symbiote.\n\n\nTwo weeks later, Peter visits MJ to reintroduce himself to her and Ned, but he decides against it. While mourning at May's grave, he has a conversation with Hogan and is inspired to carry on, making a new suit and resuming his vigilantism.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAndrew Garfield (top) and Tobey Maguire (bottom) return as their respective versions of Spider-Man from previous film franchises. Their involvement was kept secret by Marvel and Sony despite fan speculation and leaks before the film's premiere.\n\n* Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:  \nA teenager and Avenger who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[5] The film explores the fallout of *Spider-Man: Far From Home*'s (2019) mid-credits scene, in which Parker's identity as Spider-Man is exposed,[6] and Parker is more pessimistic in contrast to previous Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films. Holland said Parker feels defeated and insecure and was excited to explore the darker side of the character.[7] The adjustment back to portraying Parker, including raising his voice pitch and returning to the mindset of a \"naïve, charming teenager\", was strange for Holland after taking on more mature roles such as in *Cherry* (2021).[8]\n* Zendaya as Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson:  \nParker's classmate and girlfriend.[9][10][11] The character's full name is revealed in the film, having previously just been known as Michelle Jones, bringing her closer to the comics counterpart Mary Jane Watson.[10]\n* Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange:  \nA neurosurgeon who became a Master of the Mystic Arts following a career-ending car accident.[12][13] Holland felt Strange was not a mentor to Parker, unlike Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark in *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017), but instead saw them as colleagues and noted their relationship breaks down throughout the course of the film.[14] Cumberbatch felt there was a close relationship between Strange and Parker because both are neighborhood superheroes with a shared history.[15] Co-writer Chris McKenna described Strange as the voice of reason in the film.[16]\n* Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds: Parker's best friend.[17][10] Batalon lost 102 pounds (46 kg) for his role in this film.[18]\n* Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan: The head of security for Stark Industries and former driver and bodyguard of Tony Stark, who looks after Parker.[19]\n* Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon / Electro:  \nAn Oscorp electrical engineer from an alternate reality who gained electric powers after an accident involving genetically modified electric eels. Foxx reprises his role from Marc Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* (2014).[17][20] The character was redesigned for *No Way Home*, foregoing his original blue Ultimate Marvel-based design in favor of a yellow one more similar to his mainstream comic book appearance.[21]\n* Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin:  \nA scientist and the CEO of Oscorp from an alternate reality who tested an unstable strength enhancer on himself. He developed an insane split personality as a result and uses advanced Oscorp armor and equipment. Dafoe reprises his role from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy.[22] Dafoe felt Green Goblin had advanced from his portrayal in *Spider-Man* (2002) and had \"a few more tricks up [his] sleeves\" in this film.[23] Dafoe was digitally de-aged for the role,[24] and the character also obtains upgrades to his costume to make him more closely resemble his comic book counterpart.[23]\n* Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus:  \nA scientist from an alternate reality with four artificially intelligent mechanical tentacles fused to his body after an accident. Molina reprises his role from Raimi's *Spider-Man 2* (2004),[25] with this film continuing from the character's story prior to his death in that film. Molina was surprised by this approach because he had aged in the years since he made that film; digital de-aging was also used to make him look physically the same as in *Spider-Man 2*.[26] The mechanical tentacles were created completely through CGI, rather than blending them with puppetry as in *Spider-Man 2*.[27][24]\n* Benedict Wong as Wong: Strange's mentor and friend who became the new Sorcerer Supreme during Strange's absence in the Blip.[28][19]\n* Tony Revolori as Eugene \"Flash\" Thompson: Parker's classmate and former rival.[29]\n* Marisa Tomei as May Parker:  \nParker's aunt.[30] While developing the story, the writers realized that May would play a role similar to Uncle Ben's role in other incarnations of Spider-Man. As such, the thematic and often-paraphrasingly-quoted idiom \"with great power, there must also come great responsibility\" is said by May, since she has been the \"moral guide\" for Parker in the MCU.[31]\n* Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:  \nAn alternate version of Parker who is haunted by his failure to save his deceased girlfriend, Gwen Stacy.[32][31] Garfield reprises his role from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* films.[33][34] The other Spider-Men refer to him as \"Peter-Three\",[35] while Marvel's official website named him \"The Amazing Spider-Man\".[36] Garfield embraced his role as the middle brother of the group and was interested in exploring the idea of a tortured Parker following the events of *The Amazing Spider-Man 2*, including how lessons from those events could be passed to Holland's character.[31] He was grateful for the chance to \"tie up some loose ends\" for his incarnation of Parker, and described working with Holland and Maguire as an opportunity to have \"deeper conversations... about our experiences with the character\".[37] Parker ends up saving MJ during the climax in a similar way to how he fails to save Stacy in *The Amazing Spider-Man 2*; McKenna and co-writer Erik Sommers credited director Jon Watts for coming up with the idea while they watched a pre-visualization reel showcasing ideas for the climactic battle.[16]\n* Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:  \nAn alternate version of Parker who utilizes organic webbing instead of web shooters like his alternate counterparts.[38] Maguire reprises his role from Raimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy.[33][34] The other Spider-Men refer to him as \"Peter-Two\",[35] while Marvel's official website named him the \"Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man\".[36] Maguire wanted the film to reveal only minimal details about what happened to his character after the events of *Spider-Man 3* (2007).[31]\n\n\nRhys Ifans reprises his role as Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard, an Oscorp scientist from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* (2012) who transformed into a large reptilian monster while trying to regrow his missing arm. Thomas Haden Church reprises his role as Flint Marko / Sandman, a small-time thief from Raimi's *Spider-Man 3* who received an ability to transform into sand.[22] Both Ifans and Church returned to voice the characters, though footage at the end of the film when they revert to their human forms was archival footage from *The Amazing Spider-Man* and *Spider-Man 3*, respectively.[39] Watts served as a stand-in for Church on-set by providing motion-capture reference to the uncredited body double who physically replaced Church in the role.[40] Charlie Cox reprises his role as Matt Murdock from Marvel Television's Netflix series,[41] and Tom Hardy reprises his roles as Eddie Brock / Venom from Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) in an uncredited cameo appearance in the mid-credits scene.[42]\n\n\nReprising their roles from previous MCU *Spider-Man* films are Angourie Rice as Betty Brant, Parker's classmate and Ned's ex-girlfriend;[43] Hannibal Buress as Coach Wilson, Midtown School of Science and Technology's gym teacher;[44] Martin Starr as Roger Harrington, Parker's academic decathlon teacher;[45] J. B. Smoove as Julius Dell, Parker's teacher;[46] J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the host of *The Daily Bugle*;[47][48] and Gary Weeks as Department of Damage Control (DODC) agent Foster.[49] Jake Gyllenhaal appears as Quentin Beck / Mysterio via archive footage from *Far From Home*.[50] Also appearing in the film are Paula Newsome as an MIT administrator,[45] Arian Moayed as DODC agent Cleary,[50] Mary Rivera as Ned's grandmother,[45] and Cristo Fernández as a bartender serving Brock.[42] Tom Holland's brother Harry Holland was set to make a cameo as a thief, but his scenes were cut from the original theatrical release.[51] Lexi Rabe, who portrayed Stark's daughter Morgan in *Avengers: Endgame* (2019), also had an appearance that was not included in the theatrical release.[52]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lead actor Tom Holland and director Jon Watts in 2016\nDuring production on *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017), two sequels were being planned by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures.[53] In June 2017, star Tom Holland explained that each film would take place during a different year of high school for Peter Parker / Spider-Man, with the third being set during the character's senior year.[54] Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige noted in July 2019 that the third film would feature \"a Peter Parker story that has never been done before on film\" due to the ending of the second film, *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019), which publicly reveals that Parker is Spider-Man.[55]\n\n\nDevelopment on third and fourth MCU Spider-Man films had begun by August 2019, with Sony hoping Holland and director Jon Watts would return for both;[56] Holland was contracted to return for one more film, while Watts had completed his two-film deal and would need to sign on for any more films.[57][58] By then, Marvel Studios and its parent company The Walt Disney Studios had spent several months discussing expanding their deal with Sony. The existing deal had Marvel and Feige produce the Spider-Man films for Sony and receive 5% of their revenue. Sony wanted to expand the deal to include more films while keeping the same terms of the original agreement. Disney expressed concern with Feige's workload producing the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchise already and asked for a 25–50% stake in any future films Feige produced for Sony.[56][59][58] Unable to come to an agreement, Sony announced that it would be moving forward on the next Spider-Man film without Feige or Marvel's involvement. Their statement acknowledged that this could change in the future, thanked Feige for his work on the first two films, and said they appreciated \"the path [Feige] has helped put us on, which we will continue.\"[59] Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers were writing the screenplay for the third film by the time of Sony's announcement, after also doing so for *Far From Home*, but Watts was receiving offers to direct large films for other studios instead of returning to the franchise, including potentially working on a different property for Marvel Studios and Feige.[58]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman Tony Vinciquerra said that \"for the moment the door is closed\" on Spider-Man returning to the MCU, and confirmed that the character would be integrated with Sony's own shared universe—Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU)—moving forward. Responding to backlash from fans following the announcement, Vinciquerra added that \"the Marvel people are terrific people, we have great respect for them, but on the other hand we have some pretty terrific people of our own. [Feige] didn't do all the work ... we're pretty capable of doing what we have to do here.\"[60] However, after this fan reaction continued at Disney's biennial convention D23, and at the urging of Holland who personally spoke to Disney CEO Bob Iger and Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group chairman Tom Rothman,[61] the companies returned to negotiations.[62] Sony and Disney announced a new agreement at the end of September which would allow Marvel Studios and Feige to produce another MCU Spider-Man film for Sony with Amy Pascal, scheduled for July 16, 2021.[5] Disney was reportedly co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of its profits, while retaining the character's merchandising rights.[5][62] Feige said he was \"thrilled\" that the character would remain in the MCU and said \"all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working\" on the franchise. The agreement also allowed Holland's Spider-Man to appear in a future Marvel Studios film as well as crossing over to Sony's own shared universe,[5] with the latter interaction described as \"a 'call and answer' between the two franchises as they acknowledge details between the two in what would loosely be described as a shared detailed universe\". Sony described their previous films with Marvel Studios as a \"great collaboration\", and said \"our mutual desire to continue was equal to that of the many fans.\"[62] At the time of the new agreement, Watts was in final negotiations to direct the film.[63]\n\n\nDiscussing the new deal in October, Iger attributed it to the efforts of Holland as well as the fan response to the end of the original deal. He felt that both Sony and Disney had initially forgotten that \"there are other people who actually matter\" while they were negotiating.[64] Rothman said the deal was a \"win-win-win. A win for Sony, a win for Disney, a win for the fans.\" He felt the initial reports on the negotiations did not necessarily line up with the actual discussions that were taking place, and said the final deal would have eventuated without the reports and fan discourse.[65] Zendaya was confirmed to be reprising her role as MJ from the previous films in the sequel.[9]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nMcKenna and Sommers began working on the script in earnest by December 2019.[31][16] They considered featuring Kraven the Hunter as the film's main antagonist,[31] an idea that Watts had expressed interest in and pitched to Holland,[66][67] before gravitating towards a story idea similar to *It's a Wonderful Life* (1946) in which Parker makes a wish regarding his now public identity. That idea introduced Dr. Stephen Strange to the story, and the duo began exploring the idea of the multiverse and potentially revisiting characters from past *Spider-Man* films. Initially they thought this would just be a tease for fans but they ultimately decided to fully integrate the past characters into the plot. Sommers said, \"Once it was collectively decided that we were going to take this swing, we had to commit and we had to do what was right for the story.\" They optimistically wrote for all the characters they wanted in the film before those actors were confirmed to be returning.[31] Initial drafts of the film included every major character from past *Spider-Man* films returning, but this was narrowed down because the pair felt they had \"bit[ten] off more than [they] could chew\". The duo worked hard to prevent the film from just being \"a bunch of fan service\" by using the returning characters to help tell Peter Parker's story instead of just creating \"curtain calls for everybody\".[16] Norman Osborn / Green Goblin from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy was not the main villain of the film in the first version of the script, despite still appearing as an antagonist; after the film lost \"other characters\", McKenna and Sommers concluded that the Green Goblin \"had to be\" the main villain and rewrote the script to give him a second chance to replicate his actions in *Spider-Man* (2002), but in a darker way related to Holland's version of Spider-Man.[68] America Chavez had been considered to appear in the film at one point to serve in the sorcerer's apprentice-type role that eventually became part of Ned Leeds's role in the film; she would go on to appear in *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (2022).[69]\n\n\nBy the end of 2019, filming was expected to begin in mid-2020.[70] In April 2020, Sony rescheduled *No Way Home*'s release to November 5, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[71] Although the film was originally meant to be set after the events of *Multiverse of Madness*, release date changes meant *No Way Home* would be released first which meant aspects of the plot had to be rewritten,[72] including Strange no longer having firsthand knowledge of the multiverse. McKenna felt this made it \"even more frightening, to start fooling around with these things, because it's the fear of the unknown\".[16] In June, Marisa Tomei confirmed that she would return as May Parker along with Watts as director. She was hopeful that May's work as a community organizer would be featured in the film.[30] Also in June, Charlie Cox, who portrayed Matt Murdock / Daredevil in Marvel Television's Netflix series, was contacted by Feige about reprising his role in upcoming Marvel Studios projects starting with appearances in *No Way Home* and the Disney+ series *She-Hulk: Attorney at Law*.[73][74] The next month, Holland said production was planned to take place from late 2020 to February 2021,[75] and Sony shifted the film's release date to December 17, 2021.[76] Tony Revolori was also confirmed to be reprising his role as Flash Thompson.[29] In early October, Jacob Batalon and Benedict Cumberbatch were set to reprise their MCU roles of Ned Leeds and Strange, while Jamie Foxx was set to return as Max Dillon / Electro from Marc Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* (2014), with filming beginning later in the month.[17][12] Immediately prior to the beginning of filming, several other key actors in the film had yet to sign on. According to Holland, the film needed \"all or none\" of the actors in order to be produced.[72]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSecond unit filming occurred from October 14 to 16, 2020, in New York City,[77][78][79] under the working title *Serenity Now*,[80][78] to capture visual effects plates and establishing shots.[77] Filming occurred in the Astoria, Sunnyside, and Long Island City neighborhoods in Queens.[81][79] On October 23, filming occurred in Greenwich Village in Manhattan.[82]\n\n\nThe production moved to Atlanta by October 25, with Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya joining for principal photography,[83][84] after Holland finished shooting Sony's *Uncharted* (2022) two days earlier.[85][77][86] Mauro Fiore served as cinematographer on the film,[87] replacing Seamus McGarvey,[88] who had to leave the production after contracting COVID-19. McGarvey also had a conflict with the film *Cyrano* (2021) following *No Way Home*'s pandemic-caused production delay,[89] as principal photography was originally planned to start in July 2020.[90][91][75] Shooting in Atlanta occurred at Trilith Studios, with strict safety measures in place on the soundstages to prevent exposure to COVID-19.[92] To reduce interactions between cast and crew members on set during the pandemic, the production reportedly relied on \"innovative new technology\" that scanned actors into a visual effects system that can apply make-up and costumes to actors during post-production.[93] A light system was also in-place to signal when the cast could take off their masks for filming and when masks would be required for the cast and crew members to wear while set work was being done.[94] Cumberbatch began shooting his scenes in Atlanta by late November, before beginning work on *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* which began filming that month in London.[95][96] Filming ran for seven-to-eight weeks using the working titles *Serenity Now* and *The November Project*, before a break during the 2020 Christmas season.[97][86][98]\n\n\nBy December 2020, Alfred Molina was set to reprise his role as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man 2* (2004),[25] with Tobey Maguire reprising his role as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy and Andrew Garfield returning as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* films.[31] A cameo appearance of Maguire and Garfield alongside Holland as their respective Spider-Men had previously been considered for the Sony Pictures Animation film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* (2018), but was cut then because Sony felt at that moment that it would be too risky and confusing.[99] At that time, *Collider* reported that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film alongside Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson from Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy from the *Amazing Spider-Man* films.[100] The first draft of the script included other characters from the *Spider-Man* and *Amazing Spider-Man* films, but the writers felt that including too many characters would negatively affect the story.[16] The rumors about returning actors led to speculation and commentary, with Richard Newby of *The Hollywood Reporter* believing that a crossover-style film could \"lessen the impact\" of Sony's successful animated *Into the Spider-Verse* film.[101] His colleague Graeme McMillan felt a \"Spider-Verse\" crossover would allow Marvel to \"clean up some loose ends ... and fulfill some fan dreams in the process\", especially if Marvel and Sony's negotiations meant that they wanted to separate Spider-Man from the MCU.[102] */Film*'s Hoai-Tran Bui feared the film was becoming over-crowded and wished that Holland could lead a Spider-Man film without a \"bigger A-list star showing him the ropes\",[103] while Adam B. Vary of *Variety* noted that these reports were not confirmed and questioned whether the returning actors would be making more than cameo appearances.[104] Shortly after, Holland denied that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film.[86] Many of the actors returning from previous *Spider-Man* films were brought to set in cloaks in order to help prevent their involvements in the film from leaking.[105] Around Christmas 2020, McKenna and Sommers rewrote the introductions of Maguire and Garfield as well as much of the third act in time for those actors to start filming. They had not been able to focus on those scenes earlier because they were busy during filming of much of the first and second acts in the previous months.[16]\n\n\nFeige confirmed in December 2020 that the film would have connections to *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness*.[106] A month later he discussed the fact that the film's title had not yet been announced, acknowledging that it was being referred to by some as *Spider-Man 3* and revealing that Marvel was referring to it as *Homecoming 3* internally.[107] Cox had shot material for the film by then.[41] An Atlanta set photo indicated that the film would be set during the Christmas season.[108] Filming occurred at Frederick Douglass High School from January 22 to 24.[109][*additional citation(s) needed*] The next month, Holland described it as \"the most ambitious standalone superhero\" film,[97] and again denied the rumors that Maguire and Garfield would appear.[110][8] At the end of February, the film's title was revealed to be *Spider-Man: No Way Home*, continuing the naming convention of the past two films of featuring \"home\" in the title.[111] Filming took place at Midtown High School from March 19 to 21.[109][112] The Atlanta Public Schools system had stopped allowing buildings in the district for use as filming locations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but gave this film an exception since both the Frederick Douglass and Midtown schools were previously used as filming locations in *Spider-Man: Homecoming*.[109] Hannibal Buress was revealed to be reprising his role as gym teacher Coach Wilson,[112] with Buress releasing a music video in August 2021 revealing that he had filmed scenes in Atlanta.[44] Holland said *No Way Home* had more \"visceral\" fight sequences than the previous two films, with more hand-to-hand combat.[27] Filming wrapped on March 26, 2021.[113][114]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nActors reprising their roles from earlier *Spider-Man* films include Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx as Electro, Thomas Haden Church as Sandman, Rhys Ifans as Lizard, and J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.\n\nIn April 2021, Molina confirmed that he was appearing in the film, explaining that he had been told not to talk about his role in the film during production but he realized that his appearance had been widely rumored and reported on.[26] Later that month, J. B. Smoove revealed that he was returning as Julius Dell from *Far From Home*,[46] while Cox stated that he was not involved with the film.[115] In early May, Garfield denied that he had been asked to appear in the film, but later said \"never say never\",[116][117] while Angourie Rice was revealed to be returning as Betty Brant.[43] Later that month, Stone denied her involvement in the film.[118]\n\n\nSony Pictures Group President Sanford Panitch acknowledged in May that there had been confusion and frustration from fans regarding the relationship between the SSU and the MCU, but stated that there was a plan to clarify this. He believed it was already \"getting a little more clear for people [as to] where we're headed\" at that time and added that the release of *No Way Home* would reveal more of this plan. Vary commented that the apparent introduction of multiverse elements in *No Way Home* could be what would allow Holland to appear in both the MCU and the SSU.[119] The official trailer for *No Way Home* confirmed the involvements of Jon Favreau as Harold \"Happy\" Hogan and Benedict Wong as Wong, reprising their roles from past MCU films,[19] as well as J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson from *Far From Home* (Simmons previously played a different version of the character in the Raimi trilogy as well).[47] It was also confirmed that the characters Electro and Green Goblin would appear in the film,[19][20][120] with the implication that this incarnation of Green Goblin would be Willem Dafoe's version from the Raimi films.[120] In September 2021, Garfield again denied he was in the film, saying, \"No matter what I say... it's either going to be really disappointing for people or it's going to be really exciting\".[121] Garfield later described his denials as \"rather stressful but also weirdly enjoyable\".[122]\n\n\nIn early October, many commentators expected Tom Hardy to reprise his roles as Eddie Brock and Venom from *Venom* (2018) and *Venom: Let There Be Carnage* (2021), after the *Let There Be Carnage* mid-credits scene showed the characters being transported from their universe (the SSU) to the MCU.[123][124][125] Feige said there was a lot of coordination between the *Let There Be Carnage* and *No Way Home* teams to create the scene,[126] which was directed by Watts during the production of *No Way Home*.[16] Hardy ultimately appeared as Brock in the film's mid-credits scene,[42] though there had been discussions about integrating him into the film's final battle.[16] Later that month, *Empire*'s issue on *No Way Home* stated that the film would include the returns of Doctor Octopus, Electro, Dafoe's Green Goblin, Thomas Haden Church's Flint Marko / Sandman from Raimi's *Spider-Man 3* (2007), and Rhys Ifans's Curt Connors / Lizard from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* (2012).[127] Watts said these were still unconfirmed rumors and was in \"no hurry to confirm or deny appearances\" of the characters,[127] while Feige said the rumors were fun for fans but audiences should not expect them all to come true.[128] The film's second trailer confirmed the involvements of Dafoe, Church, and Ifans.[22]\n\n\nAt the beginning of November, Jorge Lendeborg Jr. revealed that he would be reprising his role as Jason Ionello from *Homecoming* and *Far From Home* in a similar role to those films that would have \"very little to do with the core\" story.[129] By the middle of the month, additional photography had been completed for the film.[130] Pascal described *No Way Home* as \"the culmination of the *Homecoming* trilogy\",[131] and Arian Moayed revealed that he had a role in the film.[132] Dunst said she was not in the film,[133] but would \"never say no\" to reprising her role of Mary Jane Watson.[134] A teaser trailer for *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* was included at the end of the film as a post-credits scene,[135] before being released online shortly after *No Way Home*'s theatrical release.[136]\n\n\nJeffrey Ford and Leigh Folsom Boyd served as the film's editors.[137] The visual effects were provided by Cinesite, Clear Angle Studios, Crafty Apes, Digital Domain, Folks VFX, Framestore, Luma Pictures, Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies, Mr. X, Perception, Secret Lab, Sony Pictures Imageworks, and SSVFX.[138]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (soundtrack)\n\nIn November 2020, *Homecoming* and *Far From Home* composer Michael Giacchino was confirmed to be returning for *No Way Home*.[139][140] The film's score album was released digitally on December 17, 2021, with a track titled \"Arachnoverture\" released as a single on December 9 and another titled \"Exit Through the Lobby\" released the following day.[141] Giacchino references themes from previous *Spider-Man* films by Hans Zimmer, James Horner, Christopher Young,[142] and Danny Elfman, as well as his own themes from *Doctor Strange* (2016).[143] Regarding the use of these other themes, Giacchino did not want their use to be fan service and finding ways to include them in a \"very targeted\" way. He and Watts were \"very much in alignment in terms of when to use them and when not to use them for their maximum effect\".[144]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Sony entered a promotional partnership with Hyundai Motor Group to showcase their new models and technologies in the film;[145] Hyundai later released a commercial, titled \"Only Way Home\", that was directed by Watts to promote the film and the Ioniq 5 electric-powered SUV (which appears in the film along with the Hyundai Tucson), with Holland and Batalon starring.[146] In late February 2021, Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya released three stills featuring their characters from the film alongside fake logos with the titles *Spider-Man: Phone Home*, *Spider-Man: Home-Wrecker*, and *Spider-Man: Home Slice*, respectively.[147] The film's official title was announced the next day with a video showing Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya leaving Watts's office (where they supposedly received the fake titles). Batalon and Zendaya note that Holland could not be trusted with the actual title since he had \"accidentally\" revealed the second film's title. The video ends on a whiteboard showing the film's true title, among various other titles featuring the word \"home\" that were apparently considered.[111] Jennifer Bisset of *CNET* suggested the fake titles and logos could represent the villains in the film, including Foxx's Electro and Molina's Doctor Octopus,[147] while *TheWrap*'s Umberto Gonzalez called them funny \"bait-and-switch fakes\", and noted the *Phone Home* title referenced a line from *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982).[148] Gregory Lawrence of *Collider* felt the *Home-Wrecker* title could point to the film feeling like a 1990s thriller film, and said the fake titles were a \"solid goof\" to excite fans. He also compared the stills to the \"terrifying/awe-inspiring wonder\" of Steven Spielberg films and *The Goonies* (1985),[149] while Germain Lussier from *io9* said they gave off \"subtle *National Treasure*, *Indiana Jones* vibes\".[150] In July 2021, Marvel revealed various toys and figurines for the film, including Funko Pops, Marvel Legends figures, and Lego sets.[151]\n\n\nAt the end of August 2021, when asked about the lack of trailer and official images or descriptions for the film, Feige stated that the film was not being \"any more or less secret than any of our other projects\" and reaffirmed that a trailer would be released before the film's premiere in theaters.[152] Though Sony handles the marketing for the film, their marketing team is in coordination with Disney's to ensure each knows when the other is releasing MCU-related content so it is a \"win-win for everybody\".[153] On August 22, an apparent leak of the first trailer was shared on social media,[154][155][156] which *The Hollywood Reporter* deemed \"legitimate\" after Sony worked to have various copies of the trailer taken down.[154] Adam Chitwood at *Collider* noted the built up online \"fervor\" surrounding the trailer and felt that it would not be able to \"live up to the hype fans have built up in their minds\". Chitwood continued that the other 2021 film releases from Marvel Studios had not seen a similar level of demand as *No Way Home*, pointing out that all of the rumored castings had positioned the film to be a \"once-in-a-lifetime moviegoing experience\" if they were accurate. He also wondered if Sony was wary of committing marketing that noted the film's December 2021 release date amid the resurgence of the COVID-19 Delta variant.[157]\n\n\nThe film's teaser trailer was officially released on August 23 during Sony's CinemaCon 2021 panel.[20] *Entertainment Weekly*'s Devan Coggan noted that the trailer confirmed the multiverse's role in the film, including elements from the Raimi and Webb films,[6] while Ethan Anderton from */Film* called the trailer \"nothing short of thrilling\" since it confirmed many of the previous rumors about the film.[158] Austen Goslin at *Polygon* conversely felt much of what had been rumored did not get revealed in the trailer, feeling that the rumors were either false or Marvel was still intending to keep them a secret.[159] Anderton's colleague Joshua Meyer called the trailer \"a doozy... packed with jaw-dropping moments\" and noted how the film would be adapting the \"One More Day\" comic book storyline;[160] Newby had previously noted the apparent adaption of \"One More Day\" and \"One Moment in Time\" storylines following the reveal of Cumberbatch's casting.[101] Many commentators noted the possible teases of Spider-Man villains Sandman and the Lizard in the trailer as an indication of the Sinister Six forming in the film.[47][120][161] Vinnie Mancuso at *Collider* was excited to see the return of Molina and the potential for Dafoe's involvement, but called it a \"cheap pop\" since it was doing \"a disservice to the stories you're trying to tell in the present by reminding the audience how much better things used to be\". He also felt the trailer played into \"Marvel's ongoing reluctance to let Tom Holland's Spider-Man star in his own Spider-Man movies\" since the trailer gave Parker \"zero memorable moments\" amongst all of its elements.[162] The trailer had 355.5 million global views in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period. This surpassed the record of *Avengers: Endgame* (289 million views) and more than doubled the views for the *Spider-Man: Far From Home* trailer (135 million). It also generated the largest 24-hour social media conversation volume of all-time globally with 4.5 million mentions, made up of 2.91 million in the United States, and 1.5 million internationally; these both exceeded *Avengers: Endgame*'s mentions (1.94 million in the United States, 1.38 million internationally).[163]\n\n\nThe second official trailer premiered at a fan screening at the Regal Sherman Oaks theater in Los Angeles on November 16, 2021.[164] Goslin felt the trailer \"reveals the full extent of Marvel's Spider-Man multiverse\",[165] while his colleague Matt Patches noted the missing appearance of Maguire's or Garfield's Spider-Man in the trailer but felt that it was \"entirely possible the actors appear in *No Way Home*\".[166] Jason Robbins of *Collider* was disappointed by the trailer, saying it was \"what we expected, but less\", since it just showed the returning villains and had no confirmation of Maguire or Garfield or \"further insight into the multiverse\".[48] Some commentators said parts of the trailer appeared as though Maguire and Garfield had been edited out of the footage, such as a shot in which the Lizard appears to be struck by an invisible force.[167][168] On November 24, Sony began releasing several videos on TikTok as part of their *The Daily Bugle* viral marketing campaign featuring Simmons and Rice.[169] In December 2021, the first minute of the film premiered exclusively on *Late Night with Seth Meyers*,[170] while a newsstand for *The Daily Bugle* was set up in New York City in partnership with Liberty Mutual to promote the film.[171] Other marketing partners include the video games *Fortnite* and *PUBG Mobile*, which featured special in-game Spider-Man themed props and costumes, Asus, whose Republic of Gamers (ROG) laptop is used by Ned in the film, Xiaomi, iQOO, Continental AG, and Tampico Beverages. The film had a total promotional marketing value of $202 million.[172]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Spider-Man: No Way Home* had its world premiere at Fox Village Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on December 13, 2021.[173][174] The film was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland on December 15,[175] and in the United States on December 17, where it opened in 4,325 theaters including in IMAX and other premium large formats.[176] It was previously set for release on July 16, 2021,[5] but was pushed back to November 5,[71] before it was further shifted to the December 2021 date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[76] It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.[177]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Sony and CJ 4DPlex announced a deal to release 15 of Sony's films over three years in the ScreenX format, including *No Way Home*.[178] In November 2021, the film was reported to be getting a theatrical release in China, making it the first Phase Four film to do so as *Black Widow*, *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings*, and *Eternals* were not released in the country,[179] though as of February 2022[update], there is no release date,[180] in part because of diplomatic tensions between China and the United States,[181][180] including the U.S. diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.[181] Chinese authorities had requested for the Statue of Liberty to be removed from the film, which Sony refused.[182]\n\n\n\n#### *The More Fun Stuff Version*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Theatrical release poster for *The More Fun Stuff Version*. It was considered an improvement from the original poster since it featured all the characters previously kept secret with the marketing of the original release.[183][184][185]\nAn extended cut of the film, subtitled *The More Fun Stuff Version*, was announced in June 2022. The re-release celebrates 60 years of Spider-Man in comics and 20 years of Spider-Man in film,[186] and features approximately 13 minutes of additional and deleted scenes. The additions include: an introduction by Holland, Maguire, and Garfield; additional scenes of Parker and May being interrogated by the Department of Damage Control; the scene with Holland's brother Harry as a thief that was cut from the original release; *Daily Bugle* reports of Parker's first day back at school and the arrivals of Dillon and Marko; additional scenes of Parker at school; Brant interviewing Parker, his teachers, and his classmates; additional scenes in the basement of the New York Sanctum; a scene featuring May, Parker, and the villains in an elevator while on the way to Hogan's apartment; an additional scene with Murdock and Hogan; additional scenes of the three Parkers; and a new post-credits scene, replacing the *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* teaser trailer, which showcases the effects of Strange's second spell.[187]\n\n\n*The More Fun Stuff Version* was released in theaters beginning August 31, 2022, in Indonesia, followed by the United States and Canada, among other countries, on September 1, and later in a number of other markets through October 6.[188][189] The poster for the extended cut was considered an improvement from the original release's marketing, since it was able to feature all of the characters previously kept a secret leading up to the film's release.[183][184][185] Shrishty Mishra at *Collider* said it was an \"*Avengers*-style poster [with] a perfect blend of the multiverse feels, combined with the 'Where's Waldo' effect\".[183] Anthony Lund of *MovieWeb* called it an \"epic poster that [the fans] have been calling out for\".[190] *ComicBook.com*'s Russ Burlingame said the poster was what \"we've all been waiting for\" and \"a big change in the way [Sony] initially promoted the movie\" since they \"continued to play coy\" on the cameos after the film had released.[185]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External images |\n| --- |\n| ![image icon](image) of course, we got THE meme... presents the home media announcement tweet and 1960s TV series meme homage image from SpiderManMovie's Twitter |\n| ![image icon](image) The Spider-Man pointing meme, via The Origins of the Iconic 'Spider-Man' Pointing' Meme, Nerdist Industries |\n\n\n*Spider-Man: No Way Home* was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on digital download on March 15, 2022,[191] and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on April 12. Digitally, the film was also available in a three-film bundle including all of Marvel Studios' Spider-Man films, as well as an eight-film bundle including Holland, Maguire, and Garfield's films.[192] Sony moved the digital release up to March 15 from March 22, following Blu-ray versions of the film being leaked to torrent sites.[193][191] The home media includes a gag reel and various behind-the-scenes featurettes, including two roundtable discussions: one with Dafoe, Molina, and Foxx, and another with Holland, Maguire, and Garfield.[194] It has the most pre-release digital purchases on Vudu, surpassing the purchases for *Avengers: Endgame*. To announce the home media release dates, Sony and the film's social media accounts posted a photo of Holland, Maguire, and Garfield recreating a popular meme from the 1967 *Spider-Man* television series of multiple Spider-Men pointing at one another; the tweets of the image garnered more than 10,000 retweets within minutes of being posted.[195] Within its first week of release, the film sold over 2.1 million digital units in the United States, equaling $42 million; this was a record for a film's first week available on digital release.[196] It was also the highest-selling film on physical media for 2022 in the US according to The NPD Group.[197]\n\n\nThe film was released on Starz following its theatrical and home media releases, the last film released by Sony with an exclusive limited streaming video on demand (SVOD) release on Starz. Following films would be released on Netflix after their theatrical and home media releases, through 2026.[198][199] Additionally, Sony signed a deal with Disney in April 2021 giving the latter access to Sony's legacy content, including past Spider-Man films and Marvel content in the SSU, to stream on Disney+ and Hulu and appear on Disney's linear television networks. Disney's access to Sony's titles to be released from 2022 through 2026 would come following their availability on Netflix.[200][201] In February 2022, Sony expanded their pre-existing deal with WarnerMedia for making their films available on HBO Max and HBO across Central and Eastern Europe, which included *No Way Home*.[202] *The More Fun Stuff Version* was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on digital on October 18, 2022 as *Spider-Man: No Way Home – Extended Cut*,[203] when it also began streaming on Starz.[204]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Spider-Man: No Way Home* grossed $814.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.108 billion in other territories for a worldwide total of $1.922 billion.[3][4] It is the highest-grossing film of 2021,[205] the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time,[206] the third-highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada,[207] the highest-grossing *Spider-Man* film, and the highest-grossing film released by Sony.[208] *No Way Home* is also the first film since *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* (2019) to gross over $1 billion,[209] becoming the third-fastest to reach that milestone and the first to do so during the COVID-19 pandemic.[210] It surpassed *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* (2017) to become Sony Pictures' highest-grossing film in North America.[208] Based on a final projected worldwide gross of $1.75 billion (a figure that was surpassed), *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the film's final net profit at $610 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs versus box office grosses and home media revenues.[211] It returned the global revenue of Cineworld, the world's second-largest cinema operator, to 88% of 2019 levels.[212]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, *Spider-Man: No Way Home* earned $121.85 million (which included $50 million from its Thursday night previews) on its opening day, becoming the second-highest opening film after *Avengers: Endgame* ($157.4 million) and the highest-opening film for a December release. In its opening weekend, it grossed $260 million, surpassing *Avengers: Infinity War* ($257.7 million) to become the second-highest domestic box office opening of all time.[213] As of January 9, 2022[update], an estimated 54.4 million people have seen *Spider-Man: No Way Home* in theaters in the United States and Canada.[214] The film remained at the top of the box office for three additional weekends until it was dethroned in its fifth weekend by *Scream*.[215][216][214][217] In its sixth weekend of release, *Spider-Man: No Way Home* reclaimed the top spot at the box office.[218] The film once again held onto the number one spot in its seventh weekend of release.[219] In March 2022, the film surpassed $800 million in the United States and Canada, becoming the third film to do so after *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (2015) and *Avengers: Endgame*. Comscore Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian called the film \"arguably the most important movie to the movie theater industry ever\", as it helped show the viability of the movie theater industry and the benefit of theatrical release windows while the industry recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic.[196] The film dropped to the 11th spot on its 15th weekend.[220] *Spider-Man: No Way Home* returned to first place at the box office, earning $1.8 million on the first day of the release of *The More Fun Stuff Version*,[221] and went on to finish third with $6.5 million over the four-day Labor Day weekend, finishing behind *Top Gun: Maverick* and *Bullet Train*.[222] It was the highest opening weekend box office gross for a re-released MCU film, surpassing *Avengers: Endgame* ($5.5 million) and *Spider-Man: Far From Home* ($4 million).[223]\n\n\n*Spider-Man: No Way Home* earned $43.6 million from 15 markets on its opening day, with Sony holding the best opening-day record in South Korea, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Italy, and Taiwan. In South Korea, the film grossed $5.28 million on its opening day, thereby beating *Spider-Man: Far From Home*'s opening day in the country by over 11% and the biggest day-one figure for any film during the pandemic. In the United Kingdom, the film beat *No Time to Die*'s opening box office record at £7.6 million ($10.1 million).[224] In India, the film's box office on its opening day was ₹320 million (equivalent to ₹360 million or US$4.3 million in 2023) to ₹345 million (equivalent to ₹390 million or US$4.6 million in 2023), beating *Endgame* and the Indian film *Sooryavanshi* (2021).[225] In its five-day opening weekend, the film grossed $340.8 million from 60 markets.[226] In Latin America as of January 16, 2022, it became the all-time highest-grossing film in Mexico ($72 million), and the second all-time highest in Brazil ($50.4 million), Central America ($12.6 million) and Ecuador ($7.9 million).[227] As of February 27, 2022[update], the film's largest markets are the United Kingdom ($127.3 million), Mexico ($76.2 million), Australia ($67.9 million), France ($65.2 million), and South Korea ($63.1 million).[228]\n\n\n\n#### Pre-sale ticket records[edit]\n\n\nTickets went on sale the midnight of November 29, 2021, with several ticket websites such as Fandango and AMC Theatres crashing due to the high influx of users attempting to purchase tickets.[229] Ticket sales on Fandango surpassed those for *Black Widow* in just two hours, and by the end of the day it became the best first-day advance ticket sale since *Endgame*,[230] while also surpassing the 24-hour ticket sales of *Avengers: Infinity War*, *Star Wars: The Last Jedi* (2017), *Spider-Man: Far From Home*, *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* and *Rogue One* (2016).[231] *No Way Home* had the second-highest one-day ticket sales on AMC, with CEO Adam Aron attributing this to Spider-Man-themed non-fungible tokens (NFTs).[231]\n\n\nThe film also set records in Mexico with $7 million in the first-day ticket sale, which was 40% above *Endgame*. In the United Kingdom, the film outsold *No Time to Die* three times in the same twelve-day span before their release, while Brazil's ticket sale was 5% above *Endgame* at the same point. The film also passed the presale records of *The Rise of Skywalker* in Poland and *No Time to Die* in Portugal. Other markets with the best presale records include Spain, Brazil, and Central America.[232]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 93%, with an average score of 7.9/10, based on 430 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A bigger, bolder *Spider-Man* sequel, *No Way Home* expands the franchise's scope and stakes without losing sight of its humor and heart.\"[233] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 60 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[234] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the first live-action Spider-Man film and the fourth MCU film overall to earn the score after *The Avengers* (2012), *Black Panther* (2018), and *Avengers: Endgame*.[213] PostTrak reported 96% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 91% saying they would definitely recommend it.[213]\n\n\nAmelia Emberwing of *IGN* gave the film 8 out of 10, stating that its \"impact on the universe as a whole, as well as the overall emotional beats, all feel earned\" while praising the performances of Dafoe, Molina, and Foxx.[235] Pete Hammond of *Deadline Hollywood* praised Watts's direction and wrote, \"Holland, Zendaya, and Batalon are a priceless trio, and the various villains and 'others' who pop in and out make this pure movie fun of the highest order. Fans will be in heaven\".[236] Peter Debruge of *Variety* praised Garfield's and Maguire's performances and felt the film \"provides enough resolution for the past two decades of Spider-Man adventures that audiences who've tuned out along the way will be rewarded for giving this one a shot\".[33] Writing for *Den of Geek*, Don Kaye gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, for its action sequences, performances and chemistry of the cast, stating that \"*No Way Home* channels the entire spectrum of Spider-Man movies while setting the character on a course all his own at last\".[237] Jennifer Bisset of *CNET* praised the action sequences, performances, and story, writing: \"A Russo Brothers influence can almost be felt ushering Holland's third Spider-Man movie into new, weightier territory. If the character is to become the next Tony Stark, this is the way to etch a few more scars into a more interesting hero's facade. If you came for the biggest movie of the year, you'll definitely leave satisfied\".[238]\n\n\nKevin Maher of *The Times* gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, saying that it was \"As satisfying to watch as it is perilous to discuss\", and described it as \"a dynamite blast of smarty-pants postmodernism that never once abandons its emotional core.\"[239] Benjamin Lee of *The Guardian* gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, praising Watts for \"bringing back numerous baddies from the previous Spider-Man universes, delivering a propulsive, slickly choreographed adventure that will appease a broad fanbase this Christmas\" but feeling that the script \"lacks the expected fizz, that sense of shaggy fun struggling to break through a more robotic plot\".[240] Kate Erbland of *IndieWire* gave the film a \"B−\", feeling that Watts's work was \"satisfying, emotional, and occasionally unsteady\". She found that the script spent \"far too long dwelling on the machinations of people and plans we already know, throwing in some awkward misdirection and simply delaying the inevitable\".[241] *The Hollywood Reporter*'s John DeFore felt that the inclusion of \"multiversal mayhem\" addressed the \"Iron Man-ification of the character\" that made Holland-centric films \"least fun\".[242]\n\n\n*CNN*'s Brian Lowry praised the humor and wrote, \"What's already apparent, though, is that this movie was conceived to be savored and enjoyed. And in what has become an increasingly elusive phenomenon, that will include whoops and hollers from appreciative fans in theaters, where *Spider-Man* will first reveal its secrets, and then, more than likely, shows off its legs.\"[243] Richard Roeper of *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film 3 out of 4 and praised the performances of Holland and Zendaya, writing: \"There's nothing new or particularly memorable about the serviceable CGI and practical effects, but we remain invested in the outcome in large part because Holland remains the best of the cinematic Spider-Men, while Zendaya lends heart and smarts and warmth to every moment she's onscreen. We continue to root for these two to make it, even if the multiverse isn't always on their side.\"[244] In contrast, Bilge Ebiri of *Vulture* called the film \"aggressively mediocre\", criticizing the action, comedy and writing, but praising Dafoe – describing him as \"once again gets to have some modest fun with his character's divided self\" – and Garfield, calling him a \"genuine delight\" and naming his the film's best performance.[245] Hannah Strong of *Little White Lies* criticized the film for poor character development particularly in regard to Holland's Peter Parker character stating,\"It's grating seeing the same character repeatedly fail to learn any lessons or show even a modicum of personal growth\". The same review was also generally critical of the film prioritizing fan service over good storytelling.[246]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Spider-Man: No Way Home*\n\n*No Way Home* was nominated for an Academy Award,[247] three Visual Effects Society awards (winning one),[248][249] a Costume Designers Guild Award,[250] a Golden Reel Award,[251] three Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards (winning all),[252] five Critics' Choice Super Awards (winning three),[253][254] and nine Saturn Awards (winning one),[255] among others. The film was disqualified from consideration for the 75th British Academy Film Awards because it was not made available on BAFTA's streaming service, reportedly due to Sony being concerned about piracy.[256] As part of the ceremony's \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest, the three Spider-Men teaming up was one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment,[257] and the film was the favorite to win the \"Fan Favorite\" film contest according to a Morning Consult survey.[258] It ended up finishing second and fourth, respectively.[259]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nBy August 2019, a fourth film in the franchise was in development alongside *No Way Home*.[56] In February 2021, Holland said *No Way Home* was the final film under his contract but he hoped to continue playing Spider-Man in the future if asked.[260] That October, Holland said *No Way Home* was being treated as \"the end of a franchise\" that began with *Homecoming*, with any additional solo films featuring the MCU Spider-Man characters to be different from the first trilogy of films and feature a tonal change.[27] A month later, Holland said he was unsure if he should continue making Spider-Man films and felt he would have \"done something wrong\" if he was still portraying the character in his thirties. He expressed interest in a film focusing on the Miles Morales version of Spider-Man instead. Despite this, Pascal hoped to continue working with Holland on future Spider-Man films.[72] Later in November, Pascal said there were plans for another trilogy of Spider-Man films starring Holland, with work on the first of those about to begin,[131] though Sony did not yet have official plans for further MCU Spider-Man films.[261]\n\n\nFeige confirmed in December that he and Pascal, along with Sony and Disney, were actively beginning to develop the story for the next *Spider-Man* film following Parker's \"momentous decision\" in *No Way Home*. He promised that the partnership between Sony and Disney would not break down again as it did during the development of *No Way Home*.[262] In April 2022, following Watts' exit as director of Marvel Studios' *Fantastic Four* in order to take a break from blockbuster films, *Deadline Hollywood* reported that Sony still expected Watts (along with Holland and Zendaya) to eventually return for the next MCU *Spider-Man* film.[263] Feige said in February 2023 that they had a story for the film with \"big ideas\" and that writers had begun work on it.[264] Pascal said at the end of May that the film was still in development but that work was put on hold because of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike that began earlier that month, and that work would resume after the strike concluded.[265] By that time, Holland reiterated that the film was in early stages of development and that he had been involved in meetings about it, which were also put on hold because of the writers' strike.[266]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As depicted in *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019)\n2. **^** As depicted in *Spider-Man* (2002), *Spider-Man 2* (2004), and *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* (2014), respectively\n3. **^** Brock was teleported to the MCU by Strange's first spell as seen in the Sony's Spider-Man Universe film *Venom: Let There Be Carnage* (2021).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Spider-Man: No Way Home* (12A)\". *British Board of Film Classification*.

It is the second Spider-Man film reboot and the 16th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts from a screenplay by the writing teams of Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, Watts and Christopher Ford, and Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. Tom Holland stars as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Michael Keaton, Jon Favreau, Gwyneth Paltrow, Zendaya, Donald Glover, Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Bokeem Woodbine, Tyne Daly, Marisa Tomei, and Robert Downey Jr. In the film, Peter Parker tries to balance high school life with being Spider-Man while facing the Vulture (Keaton).\n\n\nIn February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony reached a deal to share the film rights for Spider-Man, integrating the character into the established MCU. The following June, Holland was cast as the title character, and Watts was hired to direct. This was followed shortly by the hiring of Daley and Goldstein. In April 2016, the film's title was revealed, along with additional cast, including Downey in his MCU role of Tony Stark / Iron Man. Principal photography began in June 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, and continued in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City. The other screenwriters were revealed during filming, which concluded in Berlin in October 2016. The production team made efforts to differentiate the film from previous Spider-Man films.\n\n\n*Spider-Man: Homecoming* premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 28, 2017, and was released in the United States on July 7, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. *Homecoming* grossed over $880 million worldwide, becoming the second-most-successful Spider-Man film and the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2017. It received praise for the light tone, its focus on Parker's high school life, and the performances, particularly of Holland and Keaton. Two sequels have been released: *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019) and *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (2021). A new trilogy of live-action films from Sony and Marvel Studios is in development.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the Battle of New York in 2012,[a] Adrian Toomes and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city, but their operation is taken over by the Department of Damage Control (DODC), a partnership between Tony Stark and the U.S. government. Enraged at being driven out of business, Toomes persuades his employees to keep the Chitauri technology they have already scavenged and use it to create and sell advanced weapons, including a flying Vulture suit Toomes uses to steal Chitauri power cells.\n\n\nEight years later,[b] Peter Parker is drafted into the Avengers by Stark to help with an internal dispute in Germany,[c] but resumes his studies at the Midtown School of Science and Technology when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full-time Avenger. Parker quits his school's academic decathlon team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. His best friend, Ned, eventually discovers his secret identity.\n\n\nParker comes across Toomes' associates Jackson Brice / Shocker and Herman Schultz selling weapons to local criminal Aaron Davis. Parker saves Davis before being caught by Toomes in the Vulture suit and dropped in a lake, nearly drowning after becoming tangled in a parachute built into his suit. He is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against further involvement with the criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of their weapons and Schultz becomes the new Shocker.\n\n\nParker and Ned study a weapon Brice left behind, removing its power core. When a tracking device on Schultz leads to Maryland, Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a DODC truck but is trapped inside, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, he races to the Washington Monument, where the core is activated and explodes, trapping Ned and their friends in an elevator. Parker saves them, including his classmate and crush Liz. Days later, in New York City, aboard the Staten Island Ferry, Parker captures Toomes' new buyer Mac Gargan but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers, but confiscates his suit as punishment for his recklessness.\n\n\nParker returns to his high school life and asks Liz to go to the homecoming dance with him. On the night of the dance, he discovers that Toomes is Liz's father. Deducing Parker's secret identity, Toomes threatens him. Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a DODC plane transporting weapons from Avengers Tower to the team's new headquarters in Upstate New York. He leaves the dance and dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit. Though he is ambushed outside by Schultz, he defeats him with Ned's help. He races to Toomes' lair, where Toomes attacks Parker, destroying the building's support columns, and leaves Parker to die, trapped in the rubble of the collapsed building. Parker escapes and intercepts the plane, steering it to crash on the beach at Coney Island. He and Toomes continue fighting, ending with Parker saving Toomes' life after the damaged Vulture suit explodes. Parker leaves Toomes for the police along with the plane's cargo. After her father's arrest, Liz moves away. Parker declines an invitation from Stark to join the Avengers full time, and Stark proposes to Pepper Potts. Stark also returns the Spider-Man suit to Parker, who puts it on just as his aunt May walks in.\n\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, an incarcerated Gargan approaches Toomes in prison, saying he has heard that the latter knows Spider-Man's real identity, though Toomes denies this.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)(L–R) Tom Holland, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Jacob Batalon, Zendaya, and director Jon Watts promoting *Spider-Man: Homecoming* at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con\n* Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:  \nA 15-year-old who gained spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[9] Producers Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal were impressed by Holland's performances in *The Impossible* (2012), *Wolf Hall* (2015), and *In the Heart of the Sea* (2015).[10] Holland took inspiration from previous Spider-Man actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, but also hoped to deliver something \"new and exciting\" with his take on the character,[11] the first to focus on Parker as \"dealing with everyday problems that a 15-year-old deals with as well as trying to save the city.\"[12] Holland attended The Bronx High School of Science in the Bronx for a few days to prepare for the role,[13] where other students did not believe he was cast as Spider-Man. Holland felt this would carry over well to the film, where other characters do not suspect Parker of being Spider-Man.[14] It took 25 to 45 minutes for Holland to get into costume, depending on if he had to wear a stunt harness underneath the suit.[13] Holland initially signed for six MCU films, including three Spider-Man films.[15]\n* Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes / Vulture:  \nA salvager-turned-arms-trafficker after his company is forced out of business. He uses a suit with mechanical wings forged from Chitauri technology.[16] Toomes is revealed to be the father of Liz, Parker's love interest.[17] Director Jon Watts wanted him to be a \"regular guy\", closer to John C. Reilly's Nova Corpsman Rhomann Dey from *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014) than other MCU villains like Thanos and Ultron, to go with Spider-Man as a \"regular kid who becomes a superhero\".[16][18] This helped avoid Toomes drawing the attention of the Avengers, and provided someone that Parker would be able to defeat while still learning to use his abilities.[19] Keaton said Toomes was not completely villainous, as \"there's parts of him that you go, 'You know what? I might see his point.'\"[20] Co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll likened Toomes to \"the dark Tony Stark\",[16] a \"businessman with a family. He wants to look out for his kids ... He doesn't have these big delusions of grandeur where he wants to take over the world, or replace the government, or even defeat the Avengers or anything. He just wants his shot at the good life.\"[21] Keaton was not hesitant to portray another comic book character after playing Batman in Tim Burton's 1989 film and its 1992 sequel.[20]\n* Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan:  \nThe former head of security for Stark Industries and Tony Stark's driver and bodyguard.[22] Hogan is \"looking after\" Parker in the film, with Favreau saying that Parker \"needs someone to help him out\".[23] Favreau previously portrayed Hogan in the *Iron Man* films, having also directed the first two of those, and described returning as just an actor as fun, allowing him \"to maintain the relationship with the MCU ... Especially when the filmmakers are taking care of you, and taking care of the characters and the story.\"[24]\n* Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts: Tony Stark's fiancée and the CEO of Stark Industries.[25]\n* Zendaya as Michelle:  \nOne of Parker's classmates, also known as \"MJ\".[26][27] Zendaya, calling her awkward but intellectual, said that \"she just feels like she doesn't need to talk to people\" because of her intelligence.[28] She added that it was \"refreshing\" that Michelle was weird and different, feeling that \"a lot of young people—especially young women—can relate to that.\"[29] Watts likened the character to Ally Sheedy's Allison Reynolds from *The Breakfast Club* (1985) or Linda Cardellini's Lindsay Weir from *Freaks and Geeks* (1999–2000).[21] The character is not a direct adaptation of Mary Jane Watson, but was given the initials \"MJ\" to \"remind you of that dynamic\",[30] with the writers \"plant[ing] the seeds in this movie\" for comparisons to Watson, but also making her \"wholly different\".[31] Feige added that Michelle is \"not obsessed with\" Parker like Watson is at times in the comics, \"she's just observant\".[30] Her full name, Michelle Jones-Watson, was revealed in the sequel *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (2021).[32]\n* Donald Glover as Aaron Davis:  \nA criminal looking to purchase weapons from Toomes.[33][34] Davis is the uncle of Miles Morales, an inheritor of the Spider-Man mantle, in the comics. Glover voiced Morales in the *Ultimate Spider-Man* television series, and campaigned to portray Spider-Man in a film in 2010. Watts was aware of the campaign, and as soon as he was hired he asked Feige about casting Glover. The role was designed as \"a surprise treat for fans\", with Davis mentioning his nephew to set up Morales potentially appearing in a future MCU film.[34] Watts insisted Glover accept the part, assuring him that if he declined the offer, he would have scrapped Davis from the film.[35]\n* Jacob Batalon as Ned:  \nParker's best friend,[26][36][37] who is a \"complete gamer\".[38] Batalon described him as \"the quintessential best guy, the best man, the number two guy, the guy in the chair\" for Parker.[39] Marvel used Ned Leeds as a basis for the character, who does not have a last name in the script or film, but essentially created their own character with him. Carroll said that Ned and other characters in the film are composites of several of their favorites from Spider-Man comics,[37] notably Ganke Lee, who is Miles Morales' best friend in *Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man*.[40] He is given the last name \"Leeds\" in the sequel *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019),[41] which was confirmed in *No Way Home*.[32]\n* Laura Harrier as Liz: A senior, Parker's love interest, and Toomes' daughter,[42][43] with a \"type-A\" personality.[21]\n* Tony Revolori as Flash:  \nParker's rival and classmate.[43][44] It was noted that the character is generally depicted as a white bully in the comics; the Guatemalan American actor received death threats upon his casting.[43][45] Revolori worked hard \"to do him justice\", as he is an important character to the fans.[43] Rather than being a physically imposing jock, Flash Thompson was re-imagined as \"a rich, smug kid\" to reflect modern views of bullying,[46] by crafting him more into a social media bully and rival for Parker opposed to a jock;[45] this depiction was largely informed by Holland's visit to The Bronx High School of Science.[13] Revolori said that Flash has to work hard to match Parker's intelligence, which is \"one of the reasons he doesn't like Peter. Everyone else seems to like Peter, so he's like, why don't they like me like they like him?\" Revolori gained 60 lb (27 kg) for the role.[45]\n* Bokeem Woodbine as Herman Schultz / Shocker: An accomplice of Toomes' who is the second person to use modified, vibro-blast shooting versions of Brock Rumlow's gauntlets.[47][21]\n* Tyne Daly as Anne Marie Hoag: The head of the U.S. Department of Damage Control.[48][49]\n* Marisa Tomei as May Parker:  \nPeter's aunt.[50][51] First reports of Tomei's casting caused backlash on social media, with comic book fans opining that the actress was \"too young and attractive to portray the character\",[52] especially after the character had previously been depicted by actresses older than Tomei. Regarding the casting, *Captain America: Civil War* (2016) co-writer Stephen McFeely said that, for the MCU, they were trying to make Peter \"as naturalistic as possible...That's partly why his aunt isn't 80 years old; if she's the sister of his dead mother, why does she have to be two generations ahead?\"[53] Carroll added that the creative team was looking for more of a \"big sister\" or someone closer in age to Peter Parker in the casting process.[54] After researching the character, Tomei did make \"a case to age me up, but no they didn't do it\".[55] Tomei felt there was a \"blank slate\" from which she could develop the character, and talked to Watts about May being \"a community organizer or invested in the neighborhood\" to indicate where Peter's values come from.[56]\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:  \nA self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own invention who is Parker's mentor and the creator of the U.S. Department of Damage Control.[21][57] Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group chairman Tom Rothman noted that, beyond the commercial advantage of featuring Downey in the film, the inclusion of Stark was important due to the relationship established between him and Parker in *Captain America: Civil War*.[58] Watts noted that after Stark's actions in *Civil War*, introducing Parker to life as an Avenger, there are \"a lot of repercussions to that. Is it a first step towards Tony as some sort of mentor figure? Is he comfortable with that?\"[59] Co-writer Jonathan Goldstein compared Stark to Ethan Hawke's father character in *Boyhood* (2014).[19]\n\n\nAdditionally, Kerry Condon and Chris Evans reprise their roles as F.R.I.D.A.Y. and Steve Rogers / Captain America from previous MCU films, respectively.[60][61] Rogers appears in public service announcements played at Parker's school.[61] Garcelle Beauvais portrays Doris Toomes, Adrian's wife and Liz's mother,[62][63] and Jennifer Connelly provides the voice of Karen, the A.I. in Parker's suit.[60] Hemky Madera appears as Mr. Delmar, the owner of a local bodega, while Gary Weeks portrays Damage Control agent Foster.[64] Logan Marshall-Green plays Jackson Brice, the first Shocker, who is an accomplice of Toomes' who uses modified, vibro-blast shooting versions of Brock Rumlow's gauntlets.[21][65][66] Other business partners of Toomes' include: Michael Chernus as Phineas Mason,[16][67] Michael Mando as Mac Gargan,[49][68] and Christopher Berry as Randy Vale.[64][69]\n\n\nFaculty at Parker's high school include: Kenneth Choi, who previously played Jim Morita in the MCU, as Jim's descendant Principal Morita;[66][70] Hannibal Buress as Coach Wilson,[71] the school's gym teacher, who he described as \"one of the dumbass characters that don't realize [Parker is] Spider-Man\";[72][73] Martin Starr, who reprises his previously unnamed role from *The Incredible Hulk* (2008),[74] as Mr. Harrington,[66] a teacher and academic decathlon coach;[75][76] Selenis Leyva as Ms. Warren;[77][78] Tunde Adebimpe as Mr. Cobbwell;[64] and John Penick as Mr. Hapgood.[79] Parker's classmates include: Isabella Amara as Sally;[80][81] Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as Jason Ionello;[80][82] Josie Totah[d] as Seymour;[80][83] Abraham Attah as Abraham;[66][84] Tiffany Espensen as Cindy;[62][85] Angourie Rice as Betty Brant;[86][87] Michael Barbieri as Charles;[82][88][89] and Ethan Dizon as Tiny.[82] Martha Kelly appears in the film as a tour guide,[64][90] Zach Cherry appears as a street vendor who asks Spider-Man to \"do a flip\",[91] and Kirk Thatcher makes a cameo appearance as a \"punk\", an homage to his role in *Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home* (1986).[92] Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee also has a cameo, as a New York City apartment resident named Gary who witnesses Parker's confrontation with a neighbor.[93][94]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Amazing Spider-Man 2 § Cancelled sequels and spin-offs\n\n> \n> There are so many things from the comics that haven't been done yet ... stories [that Spider-Man is] in high school for a lot of it.

Discussions between Sony and Marvel broke down, and Sony planned to proceed with its own slate of Spider-Man films.[96] However, in February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that they would release a new Spider-Man film, with Kevin Feige and Pascal producing (the latter through her company Pascal Pictures).[97][98] The character would first appear in an earlier Marvel Cinematic Universe film,[97] later revealed to be *Captain America: Civil War* (2016).[99] Marvel Studios would explore opportunities to integrate MCU characters into future Spider-Man films, which Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, and have final creative control over.[97] Both studios have the ability to terminate the agreement at any point, and no money was exchanged with the deal. However, a small adjustment was made to a 2011 deal that gave Marvel full control of Spider-Man's merchandising rights, in exchange for a one-time payment of $175 million to Sony and paying up to $35 million for each future Spider-Man film rather than receiving their previous five percent of a Spider-Man film's revenue—Marvel could now reduce their $35 million payment if the co-produced film grossed more than $750 million.[100] Marvel Studios still received five percent of first dollar gross for the film.[101] Lone Star Funds also co-financed the film with Sony, via its LSC Film Corporation deal,[102] covering 25 percent of the $175 million budget,[103] while Columbia Pictures officially served as co-producer with Marvel Studios.[104] Sony also paid Marvel Studios an undisclosed producer fee.[105]\n\n\nMarvel had been working to add Spider-Man to the Marvel Cinematic Universe since at least October 2014, when they announced their slate of Phase Three films, with Feige saying, \"Marvel doesn't announce anything officially until it's set in stone. So we went forward with that Plan A in October, with the Plan B being, if [the deal] were to happen with Sony, how it would all shift. We've been thinking about [the Spider-Man film] as long as we've been thinking about Phase Three.\"[106] Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach, producers for *The Amazing Spider-Man* series, were set to serve as executive producers,[107] with neither director Marc Webb nor actor Andrew Garfield returning for the new film.[108] Sony was reportedly looking for an actor younger than Garfield to play Spider-Man,[107] with Logan Lerman and Dylan O'Brien considered front-runners.[109] In March 2015, Drew Goddard was being considered to write and direct the film,[110][111] while O'Brien said he had not been approached for the role.[112] Goddard, who was previously attached to a Sony film based on the Sinister Six, later said he declined to work on the new film as he thought he \"didn't really have an idea\" for it and struggled with the idea of working on a new film after spending a year working on the Sinister Six film and being in that mindset.[113] The following month, while promoting *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), Feige said the character of Peter Parker would be around 15 to 16 years old in the film,[95] which would not be an origin story, since \"there have been two retellings of that origin in the last [thirteen years, so] we are going to take it for granted that people know that, and the specifics\".[106] Parker's Uncle Ben is still referenced in the film,[114] but not by name.[115] There was some discussion to include a direct reference to Ben when Peter is getting ready for his homecoming by the revelation that his wardrobe consisted of Ben's clothes, but the writers desisted because they felt that the moment veered away from Parker's character arc and made Ben's death feel like a \"throwaway line\".[116] Later in April, Nat Wolff, Asa Butterfield, Tom Holland, Timothée Chalamet, and Liam James were under consideration by Sony and Marvel to play Spider-Man,[117] with Holland and Butterfield as the front-runners.[118]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Jonathan Levine, Ted Melfi, Jason Moore, the writing team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, and Jared Hess were being considered to direct the film.[119] Butterfield, Holland, Judah Lewis, Matt Lintz, Charlie Plummer, and Charlie Rowe screen tested for the lead role against Robert Downey Jr., who portrays Tony Stark / Iron Man in the MCU, for \"chemistry\".[120][121] The six were chosen out of a search of over 1,500 actors to test in front of Feige, Pascal, and the Russo brothers—the directors of *Captain America: Civil War*.[121] Lintz would later be cast as Bruno Carrelli in the Marvel Studios Disney+ series *Ms. Marvel* (2022).[122] By early June 2015, Levine and Melfi had become the favorites to direct the film, with Daley and Goldstein, and Jon Watts also in consideration,[123] while Feige and Pascal narrowed the actors considered to Holland and Rowe, with both screen testing with Downey again. Holland also tested with Chris Evans, who portrays Steve Rogers / Captain America in the MCU, and emerged as the favorite.[120] On June 23, Marvel and Sony officially announced that Holland would star as Spider-Man and that Watts would direct the film.[10] The Russos \"were pretty vocal about who [*sic*] [they] wanted for the part\", pushing to cast an actor close to the age of Peter Parker to differentiate from the previous portrayals. They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background.[99] Watts was able to read the *Civil War* script, talk with the Russos, and was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes in that film.[115] He was able to \"see what they were doing with it\" and provide \"ideas about this and that\",[124] including what Parker's bedroom and wardrobe looked like \"so that my movie transitions seamlessly with theirs\".[115] On joining the MCU and directing the film, Watts said he was excited to explore the \"ground level\" of the MCU, a world where characters like the Avengers exist but have only been depicted in previous films at \"the Penthouse level of the Marvel world\".[21]\n\n\nBefore getting the job of director, Watts created images of Nick Fury as Parker's mentor in the story in early \"mood reels\" saying, \"I don't know what the situation would be, but that would be a person he'd want to get in trouble with.\"[125] Feige said the films of John Hughes would be a major influence and that Parker's personal growth and development would be just as important as his role as Spider-Man. He noted that \"at that age, in high school, everything feels like life or death\". He also said that the film hoped to use one of Spider-Man's rogues that have not been seen in film yet,[126] and that filming would begin in June 2016.[127] In July 2015, it was reported that Marisa Tomei had been offered the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt.[50] It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay,[128] and were given three days to present Marvel with their pitch;[129] both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay.[130] The pair had proposed a take on the character that was \"diametrically opposed\" to the previous Spider-Man films, creating a laundry list of all the elements seen in those films and actively trying to avoid re-using them. They chose to focus on the high school aspects of the character rather than the \"drama and weight of the tragedy that leads to the origin of Spider-Man\". They felt this would differentiate him from the other MCU superheroes as well.[19] Daley said the film was about Parker \"finding his place\" in the MCU, with the writing team wanting the film to focus on him \"coming to terms with his new abilities and not yet being good with them, and carrying with him some real human fears and weaknesses\", such as a fear of heights when he has to scale the Washington Monument. Daley noted, \"Even within the context of this movie, I don't think you would feel that fear of heights or even the vertigo the audience feels in that scene if you establish him as swinging from skyscrapers at the top of the movie.\"[17] The writers also wanted to avoid the skyscrapers of Manhattan because of how often they were used in the other films, and instead wrote the character into locations such as \"the suburbs, on a golf course, the Staten Island Ferry, Coney Island, and even Washington, D.C.\" One of the first sequences they pitched was \"seeing Spider-Man attached to a plane 10,000 feet up in the air, where he had absolutely no safety net. ... you're familiar with the sort of areas he's been in, [so] why not turn it on its head and make it something different that people haven't seen before?\"[19] The pair conceded that the film took a more grounded, \"low-stakes\" approach than previous films, which avoided having to explain why the Avengers were not helping, since a world-threatening problem would logically require the \"big guys\".[17]\n\n\nMarvel encouraged Daley and Goldstein to express their own sense of humor in the script, with Daley saying, \"When you're seeing the world through the eyes of a fun, funny kid, you can really embrace that voice, and not give him the cookie-cutter one-liners that you're so accustomed to hearing from Peter Parker.\" Inspired by their experiences working on sitcoms, the writers also looked to create \"a network of strong characters\" to surround Parker with in the film.[19] In October 2015, Watts said he was looking to make the film a coming-of-age story to see the growth of Parker, citing *Can't Buy Me Love* (1987), *Say Anything...* (1989), and *Almost Famous* (2000) as some of his favorite films in that genre.[131] It was this aspect of the film that had initially got Watts interested in directing it, as he had already been looking to make a coming-of-age story when he heard that the new Spider-Man would be younger than previous incarnations.[132] Watts re-read the original Spider-Man comics in preparation for the film, and \"came to a new realization\" about the character's original popularity, feeling that he introduced a new perspective to the comics that had already established \"a crazy spectacular Marvel Universe ... to give a regular person's perspective on it\". He felt that this was also the responsibility of this film since it had to introduce Spider-Man to the already established MCU.[115] Specific comics that Watts noted as potential influences were *Ultimate Spider-Man* and *Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane*.[132] In December, Oliver Scholl signed on to be the production designer for the film.[133]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Watts promoting *Spider-Man: Homecoming* at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con\nWatts wanted to heavily pre-visualize the film, especially its action sequences, as he does on all his films. For *Homecoming*, Watts worked with a team to \"figure out the visual language for the action sequences and ... try stuff out before\" filming began to help Watts practice given his lack of experience working on large-scale films. For the \"web-slinging\" sequences, Watts wanted to avoid the big \"swoopy\" camera moves that had been previously used and instead \"keep it all as grounded as possible. So, whether it was shooting with a drone camera or a helicopter or a cable-cam, or even just handheld, up on a roof chasing after him, I wanted it to feel like we were there with him.\"[132]\n\n\nIn January 2016, Sony shifted the film's release date from July 28, 2017, to July 7, 2017,[134] and said the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3D in post-production.[135] J. K. Simmons expressed interest in reprising his role as J. Jonah Jameson from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* films.[136] In early March, Zendaya was cast in the film as Michelle, and Tomei was confirmed as May Parker.[51][137] The following month, Feige confirmed that characters from previous MCU films would appear,[138] and clarified that the deal formed with Sony does not specify which characters can and cannot crossover.[139] He noted that the sharing between the studios was done with \"good faith\" in order \"to have more toys to play with as we put together a story\",[7] and that \"the agreement was that it is very much a Sony Pictures movie... we are the creative producers. We are the ones hiring the actor, introducing him in [*Civil War*], and then working right now on the script and soon to be shooting.\"[139] Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman further added that Sony has final greenlight authority, but were deferring creatively to Marvel.[140] At CinemaCon 2016, Sony announced the title of the film to be *Spider-Man: Homecoming*,[141][142] a reference to the common high school tradition homecoming as well as the character \"coming home\" to Marvel and the MCU.[142] Tony Revolori – who had auditioned for Peter Parker[143] – and Laura Harrier joined the cast as classmates of Parker's,[42][144] and Downey Jr. was revealed to be in the film as Stark.[57][145] Watts noted that Stark \"was always a part of\" the film's story because of his interactions with Parker in *Civil War*.[132] Downey Jr. was paid $10 million for his involvement.[146]\n\n\nAlso in April, Michael Keaton entered talks to play a villain,[147] but dropped out of discussions shortly thereafter due to scheduling conflicts with *The Founder* (2016).[148][149] At this point, John Leguizamo was approached to fill the role and entered negotiations to do so.[150] Keaton soon reentered talks for the role after a change in schedule for *The Founder*,[149][151] which necessitated Marvel to ask Leguizamo if he would step away from the role in order to cast Keaton;[150] Keaton closed the deal in late May.[151] Marvel offered to cast Leguizamo in another role, which he considered \"tiny\" and declined.[150] Mark Hamill was interested in playing the film's villain in case Keaton turned down the offer, but Keaton reconsidered the offer in time.[152] In June, Michael Barbieri was cast as a friend of Parker's,[88][89] Kenneth Choi was cast as Parker's high school principal,[70] and Logan Marshall-Green was cast as another villain alongside Keaton's character,[65][68] while Donald Glover and Martin Starr joined the cast in undisclosed roles.[33][75] Watts said that he wanted the cast to reflect Queens as \"one of [the] most diverse places in the world\",[124] with Feige adding that \"we want everyone to recognize themselves in every portion of our universe. [With this cast] especially, it really feels like this is absolutely what has to happen and continue.\"[43] This is also different from the previous films, which were \"set in a lily-white Queens high school\".[153] Additionally, Marvel made a conscious decision to mostly avoid including or referencing characters who appeared in previous *Spider-Man* films, outside of major ones like Peter and May Parker, and Flash Thompson. This included the *Daily Bugle*, with co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll saying, \"We toyed with it for a while, but again, we didn't want to go down that road right away, and if we do do a *Daily Bugle*, we want to do it in a way that feels contemporary\".[114] This also included the character Mary Jane Watson, but Zendaya's Michelle was eventually given the initials \"MJ\" as a nod to that character. Feige said that the point of this is \"to have fun with [references] while at the same time having it be different characters that can provide a different dynamic\".[30]\n\n\nSpider-Man's costume in the film has more technical improvements than the previous suits, including the logo on the chest being a remote drone, an AI system similar to Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S., a holographic interface, a parachute, a tracking device for Stark to track Parker, a heater, an airbag, the ability to light up, and the ability to augment reality with the eyepieces. Stark also builds in a \"training wheels\" protocol, to initially limit Parker's access to all of its features. Carroll noted Marvel went through the comics and \"pull[ed] out all the sort of fun and wacky things the suit did\" to include in the *Homecoming* suit.[154] Spider-Man's web-shooters have various settings, first teased at the end of *Civil War*, which Carroll explained allowed him to \"adjust the spray\" to different settings like the spinning web, web ball, or ricochet web. He compared this to a DSLR camera.[114]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on June 20, 2016,[155] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[156] under the working title *Summer of George*.[157] Salvatore Totino served as director of photography.[158] Filming also took place in Atlanta, with locations including Grady High School,[159] Downtown Atlanta,[160] the Atlanta Marriott Marquis,[161] Piedmont Park, the Georgia World Congress Center,[162] and the West End neighborhood.[163] Holland said building New York sets in Atlanta was cheaper than actually filming in New York, a location closely associated with the character, though the production may \"end up [in New York] for one week or two\".[164] A replica of the Staten Island Ferry was built in Atlanta, with the ability to open and close in half in 10 to 12 seconds and be flooded with 40,000 gallons of water in 8 seconds.[165] Additional filming also occurred at two magnet schools in the Van Nuys and Reseda neighborhoods of Los Angeles.[166]\n\n\nCasting continued after the start of production, with the inclusion of Isabella Amara, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., Josie Totah,[80] Hannibal Buress,[72] Selenis Leyva,[77] Abraham Attah,[84] Michael Mando,[68] Tyne Daly,[48] Garcelle Beauvais, Tiffany Espensen,[62] and Angourie Rice in unspecified roles,[86] with Bokeem Woodbine joining as an additional villain.[47] At San Diego Comic-Con International 2016, Marvel confirmed the castings of Keaton, Zendaya, Glover, Harrier, Revolori, Daly, and Woodbine, while revealing Zendaya, Harrier, and Revolori's roles as Michelle, Liz Allan, and Flash Thompson, respectively,[26][36][43][167] and announcing the casting of Jacob Batalon as Ned.[36][37] It was also revealed that the Vulture would be the film's villain, while the writing teams of Watts and Christopher Ford, and Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, joined Goldstein and Daley in writing the screenplay,[36] from Goldstein and Daley's story. Eric Pearson, a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the Marvel One-Shot films, did uncredited work on the film as well.[168] Watts praised Goldstein and Daley's drafts as \"really fun and funny\", and said that they \"sort of established the broad strokes of the movie\", with him and Ford, close friends since childhood, then re-writing the script based on specific ideas that Watts had and things that he wanted to film, which he said was a \"pretty substantial structural pass, rearranging things and building it into the sort of story arc we wanted it to be.\" McKenna and Sommers then joined the film to deal with changes to the script during filming, as \"it's all a little bit flexible when you get to set. You try things out, and you just need someone to be writing while you're shooting.\"[132]\n\n\nHarrier noted that the young actors in the film \"constantly refer to ourselves as *The Breakfast Club*\".[26] Shortly after, Martha Kelly joined the cast in an unspecified role.[90] In August, Michael Chernus was cast as Phineas Mason / Tinkerer,[67] while Jona Xiao joined the cast in an unspecified role,[169] and Buress said he was playing a gym teacher.[73] By September 2016, Jon Favreau was reprising his role as Happy Hogan from the *Iron Man* series,[22] and filming concluded in Atlanta and moved to New York City. Locations in the latter area included Astoria, Queens, St. George, Staten Island, Manhattan,[170][171][172] and Franklin K. Lane High School in Brooklyn.[114] Additionally, UFC fighter Tyron Woodley said he had been considered for a villain role in the film, but had to drop out due to a prior commitment with Fox Sports.[173] Principal photography wrapped on October 2, 2016, in New York City,[174] with some additional filming taking place later in the month in Berlin, Germany, near the Brandenburg Gate.[175]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2016, Feige confirmed that Keaton would play Adrian Toomes / Vulture,[18][176] while Woodbine was revealed as Herman Schultz / Shocker.[21][177] In March 2017, Harrier said the film was undergoing re-shoots,[178] and Evans was set to appear as Steve Rogers / Captain America in an instructional fitness video.[61] Watts was inspired by The President's Fitness Challenge for this, feeling that Captain America would be the obvious version of that for the MCU. He then started brainstorming other public service announcements (PSA) starring Captain America, about \"just anything you could think of, we had poor Captain America do it\". Watts said that many of the additional PSA videos would be featured on the home media of the film.[179] According to Goldstein, additional videos featuring other Avengers were planned at some point.[180] Watts confirmed that the company Stark creates that leads Toomes on his villainous path in the film is Damage Control, which Watts felt \"just fit in with our overall philosophy with the kind of story we wanted to tell\" and created a lot of practical questions Watts wanted to use \"to drive the story\".[59]\n\n\nThe film features multiple post-credit scenes.[59][181] The first gives the Vulture a chance at redemption, showing him protect Parker from another villain. Watts said this \"was a really interesting thing in the development of the story. You couldn't just rely on the tropes of the villain being a murderer and killing a bunch of people. He had to be redeemable in some capacity in the end and that he believes everything he said, especially about his family.\" The second post-credits scene is an additional Captain America PSA, where he talks about the value of patience—a meta-referential joke at the expense of the audience, who have just waited through the film's credits to see the scene.[182] This was a \"last-minute addition\" to the film.[183] Watts completed work on *Homecoming* at the beginning of June 2017, approving the final visual effects shots. He stated that he had never been told that he could not do something by Marvel or Sony, saying, \"You assume you'll have to fight for every little weird thing you wanna do, but I didn't really ever run into that. I got to do kind of everything I wanted to.\"[132] That month, Starr explained that he was playing the academic decathlon coach at Parker's high school,[76] and Marshall-Green was said to be portraying another Shocker.[184]\n\n\nIn July, Feige discussed specific moments in the film, including an homage to *The Amazing Spider-Man* issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige \"wanted to see in a movie for a long, long time\".[185] Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, \"We have [Parker] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem.\"[17] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of *Iron Man* (2008) when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, \"What does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique.\"[186] Goldstein added that it \"diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [and] lets her become part of what's really his life.\"[17] Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, feeling that if it did not work, the film would not work. The team \"worked backwards and forwards from that moment ... You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [and it] doesn't seem like something out of left field\".[185] Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, \"more than anything else, [what] I was looking forward to, and I got to have a lot of fun shooting that stuff\".[182] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were \"giddy when we first came up with [that twist], because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time.\"[17]\n\n\n\n#### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Trixter used a LIDAR scan of Grand Central Terminal from *The Avengers* to help create their CGI version (bottom), adding to the elements filmed on set (top).[187]\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Marvel Studios' Spider-Man: Homecoming End Credits Final Main on End Title Sequence presents the film's main-on-end title sequence, YouTube video from Perception's channel |\n\n\nVisual effects for the film were completed by Sony Pictures Imageworks, Industrial Light & Magic, Luma Pictures, Digital Domain, Cantina Creative, Iloura, Trixter,[188] and Method Studios.[165] Executive producer Victoria Alonso initially did not want Imageworks, which worked on all previous Spider-Man films, to work on *Homecoming*, in order to give it a different look than those earlier films. She changed her mind after seeing what she called \"phenomenal\" test material from the vendor.[189] The film's main-on-end title sequence was designed by Perception.[190]\n\n\nTrixter contributed over 300 shots for the film, including the opening scene at Grand Central Terminal, the sequence that retells the events of *Civil War* from Parker's perspective, the sequence where Toomes takes Liz and Parker to the dance, the school battle between Parker and Schultz, and the scene around and within the Avengers compound. They also worked on both Spider-Man suits and the spider tracer. Trixter created additional salvage workers to populate the Grand Central scene, whose clothes and proportions were able to be altered to create variation. For the battle between Parker and Schultz, Trixter used an all-digital Spider-Man in his homemade suit, which came from Imageworks, with Trixter applying a rigging, muscle, and cloth system to it \"to mimic the appearance of the rather loose training suit\". They also created the effects for Schultz's gauntlets and had to change the setting from the Atlanta set to Queens, by using a CGI school and adding 360 degrees of matte paintings for the mid to far-distance elements. Trixter received concept art and basic geometry that was used previously for the Avengers compound, but ended up remodeling it for the way it appears in *Homecoming*. Models and textures for Spider-Man's Avengers costume were created by Framestore for use in a future MCU film, with Trixter creating the vault that it appears in. Trixter VFX supervisor Dominik Zimmerle said the idea was \"to have a clean, high tech, presentation Vault for the new suit. It should appear distinctively 'Stark' originated\".[187]\n\n\nDigital Domain worked on the Staten Island Ferry battle, creating the CGI versions of Spider-Man, the Vulture suit, Iron Man, and Spider-Man's drone. Digital Domain was able to LIDAR an actual Staten Island Ferry, as well as the version created on set, to help with creating their digital version.[165] Lou Pecora, visual effects supervisor at Digital Domain, called that sequence \"brutal\" because \"the way they were shot, it was lit to be a certain time of day, and afterwards it was decided to change that time of day.\"[191] Sony Pictures Imageworks created much of the third act of the film when Parker confronts Toomes on the plane and beach in his homemade suit, and Toomes is in an upgraded Vulture suit. Some elements of Vulture's first suit were shared with Imageworks, but the remainder were created by them \"based on a maquette\". For the plane's cloaking ability, Imageworks was inspired by Adaptiv IR Camouflage tank cloaking system by BAE Systems, which \"uses a series of titles to cloak against infrared\". For their web design, which was based on the one created for *Civil War*, Digital Domain referenced polar bear hair because of its translucent nature. Imageworks also looked to the *Civil War* webs, as well as to those they had created for previous Spider-Man films, in which \"the web[s] had [...] tiny barbs that aided in hooking on to things.\" For this film, they \"dialed back the barbs\" to line up more closely with the other web designs created for this film.[165] Method Studios worked on the Washington Monument sequence.[189] Iron Man's armor in the film, the Mark XLVII, is a recolored version of the MK XLVI armor introduced in *Civil War*; this was done because Sony did not have the budget to create a new Iron Man suit. Feige requested the color scheme resemble the Ultimate Iron Man armor from the comics.[192]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spider-Man: Homecoming (soundtrack)\n\nWhile promoting *Doctor Strange* in early November 2016, Feige accidentally revealed that Michael Giacchino, who composed the music for that film, would compose the score for *Homecoming* as well. Giacchino soon confirmed this himself.[193] Recording for the soundtrack began on April 11, 2017.[194] The score includes the theme from the 1960s animated series.[195] The soundtrack was released by Sony Masterworks on July 7, 2017.[196]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nWatts, Holland, Batalon, Harrier, Revolori, and Zendaya appeared at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con to show an exclusive clip of the film,[36][197] which also had a panel at Comic Con Experience 2016.[198] The first trailer for *Homecoming* premiered on *Jimmy Kimmel Live!* on December 8, 2016,[199] and was released online alongside an international version, which Feige thought was different enough that \"it would be fun for people to see both.\"[18] The shots of Vulture descending through a hotel atrium and Spider-Man swinging with Iron Man flying beside him were created specifically for the trailer. Watts explained that the Vulture shot was created for Comic-Con and \"was never meant to be in the movie\", but he was able to repurpose the angle for Vulture's reveal in the film. The Spider-Man and Iron Man shot was created because the marketing team wanted a shot of the two together, and existing shots \"just didn't look that great\" then. The trailer shot used a background plate taken when filming the subway in Queens.[115] The two trailers were viewed over 266 million times globally within a week.[103]\n\n\nOn March 28, 2017, a second trailer debuted after screening at CinemaCon 2017 the night before.[200] Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at *BoxOffice.com*, noted that the new *Justice League* trailer had received more Twitter mentions in that week but there was \"clearer enthusiasm for *Spider-Man*\". The *Homecoming* trailer was second for the week of March 20–26 in new conversations (85,859) behind *Justice League* (201,267), according to comScore's PreAct service, which is \"a tracking service utilizing social data to create context of the ever-evolving role of digital communication on feature films\".[201] An exclusive clip from the film was seen during the 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards.[202] On May 24, Sony and Marvel released a third domestic and international trailer.[203] Ethan Anderton of /Film enjoyed both trailers, stating *Homecoming* \"has the potential to be the best Spider-Man movie yet. Having the webslinger as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe just feels right\".[204] TechCrunch's Darrell Etherington agreed, saying, \"You may have feelings about a tech-heavy Spider-Man suit or other aspects of this interpretation of the character, but it's still shaping up to be better than any Spider-Man depicted in movies in recent memory.\"[205] Ana Dumaraog for Screen Rant said the second trailer \"arguably showed too much of the movie's overarching narrative\", but the third \"perfectly shows the right amount of new and old footage\". She also appreciated the attention to detail that Watts and the writers put into the film, as highlighted by the trailers.[206] Siddhant Adlakha of Birth.Movies.Death also felt the trailers were giving away too many details,[207] but enjoyed them overall, especially the \"vlogging\" aspect.[208] Collider's Dave Trombore expressed similar sentiments to Adlakha.[209] After the trailers' release, comScore and its PreAct service noted *Homecoming* was the top film for new social media conversations, that week and the week of May 29.[210][211]\n\n\nAlongside the release of the third trailers were domestic and international release posters.[203] The domestic poster was criticized for its \"floating head\" style,[207][212] which offers \"a chaotic mess of people looking in different directions, with little sense of what the film will deliver\".[212] Dan Auty for GameSpot called it a \"star studded hot mess\",[212] while *Vanity Fair*'s Katey Rich felt the poster was \"too bogged down by the many different threads of the Marvel universe to highlight anything that's made *Spider-Man: Homecoming* seem special so far\".[213] Adlakha felt the posters released for the film \"have been alright thus far, but these ones probably tell general audiences to expect a very bloated movie\". Adlakha was more positive of the international poster, which he felt was more \"comicbook-y\" and \"looks like it could be an actual scene from the film\".[207] Both Rich and Adlakha criticized the fact that Holland, Keaton, and Downey appeared twice on the domestic poster, both in and out of costume.[207][213] Sony partnered with ESPN CreativeWorks to create cross-promotional television ads for *Homecoming* and the 2017 NBA Finals, which were filmed by Watts. The ads were made to \"weave in a highlight from the game just moments\" after it occurred.[214] The promos see Holland, Downey Jr., and Favreau reprise their roles from the film, with cameo appearances from Stan Lee, DJ Khaled, Tim Duncan, Magic Johnson, and Cari Champion.[103] Through June and July 2017, a *Homecoming*-inspired cafe opened in the Roppongi Hills complex in Tokyo, offering \"arachnid-themed foods and drinks, including a Spider Curry, Spider-Sense Latte and a sweet and refreshing Strawberry Spider Squash drink\", as well as a free, limited-edition sticker with any purchase.[215]\n\n\nFor the week ending on June 11, comScore and its PreAct service noted that new social media conversations for the film were second only to *Black Panther* and its new trailer;[216] *Homecoming* was then the number one film in the next two weeks.[217][218] That month, Sony released a mobile app allowing users to \"access\" Parker's phone and \"view his photos, videos, text messages, and hear voicemails from his friends\". The app also provided an \"AR Suit Explorer\" to learn more about the technology in the Spider-Man suit, and use photo filters, GIFs, and stickers of the character.[219] Sony and Dave & Buster's also announced an arcade game based on the film, playable exclusively at Dave & Buster's locations.[220] A tie-in comic, *Spider-Man: Homecoming Prelude*, was released on June 20, collecting two prelude issues.[221] On June 28, in partnership with Thinkmodo, a promotional prank was released in which Spider-Man (stuntman Chris Silcox) dropped from the ceiling in a coffee shop to scare customers; the video also featured a cameo appearance from Lee.[222] Sony also partnered with the mobile app Holo to let users add 3D holograms of Spider-Man, with Holland's voice and lines from the film, to real-world photos and videos.[223] Before the end of June, *Spider-Man: Homecoming—Virtual Reality Experience* was released on the PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive for free, produced by Sony Pictures VR and developed by CreateVR. It allows users to experience how it feels to be Spider-Man, with the ability to hit targets with his web-shooters and face off against the Vulture. It was also available at select Cinemark Theatres in the United States and at the CineEurope trade show in Barcelona.[224]\n\n\nAhead of the film's release, for the week ending on July 2, the film was the top film for the third consecutive week for new social media conversations, according to comScore, which also noted that *Spider-Man: Homecoming* had produced a total of 2.67 million conversations to date.[225] Other promotions included Audi and Dell (both also had product placement in the film), Pizza Hut, General Mills, Synchrony Bank, Movietickets.com, Goodwill, Baskin Robbins, Dunkin' Donuts, Danone Waters, Panasonic Batteries, M&M's, Mondelez, Asus, Bimbo, Jetstar, KEF, Kellogg's, Lieferheld, PepsiCo, Plus, Roady, Snickers, Sony Mobile, Oppo, Optus, and Doritos. Watts directed a commercial for Dell's marketing efforts as well, which earned 2.8 million views online. Goodwill hosted a build-your-own Spider-Man suit contest, with the winner attending the film's premiere. Overall, the campaign generated over $140 million in media value, greater than those for all previous Spider-Man films and Marvel Studios' first 2017 release, *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2*. This does not include merchandising for the film, which is controlled by Marvel and Disney.[226] Marketing of the film in China included partnering with Momo, iQiyi, Tencent QQ, Baidu, Mizone, CapitaLand, Xiaomi, HTC, and corporate parent Sony.[227][228] To help target the teenage audience, Holland \"recorded a high school entrance exam greeting\" while *The Rap of China* contestant PG One recorded a theme song.[227]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The world premiere of *Spider-Man: Homecoming* at TCL Chinese Theatre\n*Spider-Man: Homecoming* held its world premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 28, 2017,[229] and was released in the United Kingdom on July 5.[230] It opened in additional international markets on July 6,[231] with 23,400 screens (277 of which were IMAX) in 56 markets for its opening weekend.[232] The film was released in the United States on July 7,[134] in 4,348 theaters (392 were IMAX and IMAX 3D, and 601 were premium large-format),[10][135][233] including 3D screenings.[10] It was originally slated for release on July 28.[134] *Spider-Man: Homecoming* is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[234]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Spider-Man: Homecoming* was released on digital download by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on September 26, 2017, and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, Ultra HD Blu-ray, and DVD on October 17, 2017. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[235] The physical releases in its first week of sale were the top home media release, according to NPD VideoScan data. The Blu-ray version accounted for 79% of the sales, with 13% of total sales coming from the Ultra HD Blu-ray version.[236]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Sony signed a deal with Disney giving them access to their legacy content, including past Spider-Man films and Marvel content in Sony's Spider-Man Universe, to stream on Disney+ and Hulu and appear on Disney's linear television networks. Disney's access to Sony's titles would come following their availability on Netflix. *Homecoming* had previously been available on Starz and FX.[237][238] The film became available on Disney+ in the United Kingdom and Australia on June 17, 2022,[239][240] and became available in the United States on May 12, 2023.[241]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Spider-Man: Homecoming* grossed over $334.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $546 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $880.2 million.[3] The film had the second-biggest global IMAX opening for a Sony film with $18 million.[232] In May 2017, a survey from Fandango indicated that *Homecoming* was the second-most-anticipated summer blockbuster behind *Wonder Woman*.[242] By September 24, 2017, the film had earned $874.4 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing superhero film of 2017, and the sixth-largest film based on a Marvel character.[243] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as $200.1 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it seventh on their list of 2017's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[244]\n\n\nThe film earned $50.9 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada (including $15.4 million from Thursday night previews),[103] and had a total weekend gross of $117 million, the top film for the weekend.[245] It was the second-highest opening for both a Spider-Man film and a Sony film, after *Spider-Man 3*'s $151.1 million debut in 2007.[103] Early projections for the film from *BoxOffice* had it earning $135 million in its opening weekend,[246] which was later adjusted to $125 million,[247] and *Deadline Hollywood* noting industry projections at anywhere between $90–120 million.[233] In its second weekend, the film fell to second behind *War for the Planet of the Apes* with $44.2 million, a 62% decline in earnings, which was similar to the declines *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* and *Spider-Man 3* had in their second weekends. Additionally, *Homecoming*'s domestic gross reached $208.3 million, which surpassed the total domestic gross of *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* ($202.9 million).[248] The film fell to third in its third weekend.[249] By July 26, *Homecoming*'s domestic gross reached $262.1 million, surpassing the total domestic gross of *The Amazing Spider-Man* ($262 million),[250] leading to a fifth-place finish for its fourth weekend.[251] The next weekend, *Homecoming* finished sixth,[252] and finished seventh the following five weekends.[253][254][255][256][257] By September 3, 2017, the film had earned $325.1 million,[256] surpassing the $325 million projected amount for its total domestic gross.[246] In its eleventh weekend, *Homecoming* finished ninth.[258]\n\n\nOutside of the United States and Canada, *Spider-Man: Homecoming* earned $140.5 million its opening weekend from the 56 markets it opened in, with the film becoming number one in 50 of them. The $140.5 million was the highest opening ever for a Spider-Man film.[232] South Korea had the highest Wednesday opening day gross,[259] which contributed to a $25.4 million five-day opening in the country, the third-highest opening ever for a Hollywood film.[232] Brazil had the largest July opening day of all time, with $2 million,[259] leading to an opening weekend total of $8.9 million. The $7 million earned from IMAX showings was the top opening of all time for a Sony film internationally.[232] In its second weekend, the film opened in France at number one and number two in Germany. It earned an additional $11.9 million in South Korea, to bring its total in the country to $42.2 million. This made *Homecoming* the highest-grossing Spider-Man film and the top-grossing Hollywood film of 2017 in the country. Brazil contributed an additional $5.7 million, for a total of $19.4 million from the country, which was also the largest gross from a Spider-Man film.[260] The film's third weekend saw the Latin America region set a record as the highest-grossing Spider-Man film of all time, with a region total of $77.4 million. Brazil remained the top-grossing market for the region, with $25.7 million. In South Korea, the film became the 10th-highest-grossing international release of all time.[261] *Homecoming* opened at number one in Spain in its fourth weekend.[262] In its sixth weekend, the film opened at number one in Japan, with its $770,000 from IMAX the fourth-largest IMAX weekend for a Marvel film in the country.[263] The film opened at number one in China on September 8, 2017, grossing $23 million on its opening day, including Thursday previews, making it the third biggest opening day for a Marvel Cinematic Universe film, behind *Avengers: Age of Ultron* and *Captain America: Civil War*, and the largest opening day gross for a Sony film in the country.[227] The $70.8 million *Homecoming* earned in China for its opening weekend was the third-highest opening behind *Age of Ultron* and *Civil War*, with $6 million from IMAX, which was the best IMAX opening weekend in September, and the best IMAX opening weekend for a Sony film.[228] As of September 24, 2017[update], the film's largest markets were China ($115.7 million),[243] South Korea ($51.4 million), and the United Kingdom ($34.8 million).[264]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tom Holland's performance as Spider-Man received praise.\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 92%, with an average score of 7.6/10, based on 400 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"*Spider-Man: Homecoming* does whatever a second reboot can, delivering a colorful, fun adventure that fits snugly in the sprawling MCU without getting bogged down in franchise-building.\"[265] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[266] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 89% overall positive score and a 74% \"definite recommend\".[103]\n\n\nSara Stewart of the *New York Post* praised the film as \"an endearingly awkward kid brother to the glamorous *Wonder Woman*\", attributing much of the \"heavy-lifting\" to Holland's performance and the \"perfectly cast\" Keaton. She also noted Watts' focus on Parker's human side.[267] Mike Ryan at *Uproxx* felt *Homecoming* was the best *Spider-Man* film yet, specifically praising the light tone, younger and more optimistic portrayal of Parker, and Keaton's performance—Ryan named the Vulture twist reveal as one of his favorite scenes in the MCU. He said *Homecoming* is \"the kind of movie you leave and you're just in the best mood—and still will be days later.\"[268] Richard Roeper of the *Chicago Sun-Times* called the film unique and refreshing, praising its lower stakes and focus on the character's school life. He praised Holland as \"terrific and well-cast\", as well as the other cast members; Roeper believed that Keaton's performance is more interesting than the character otherwise could have been.[269] Owen Gleiberman of *Variety* felt the film was \"just distinctive enough\" from the previous *Spider-Man* films to become a \"sizable hit\", and highlighted its focus on making Peter Parker a realistically youthful and grounded character. He found Holland to be likable in the role and thought the Vulture twist was a positive direction for that character. He did criticize the vague take on Spider-Man's origin and powers, but \"the flying action has a casual flip buoyancy, and the movie does get you rooting for Peter.\"[1] At IndieWire, David Ehrlich criticized the film's superhero genre clichés and underwritten female characters, but praised the elements of the film that leaned into Parker's high school life and the humanity of the Vulture.[270]\n\n\nKenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* gave the film a mixed review, criticizing the \"juvenile\" depiction of Parker and Watts' \"unevenly orchestrated\" direction, but feeling that the film \"finds its pace and rhythm by the end\" and praising Keaton's performance.[271] *The Hollywood Reporter*'s John DeFore found the film to be \"occasionally exciting but often frustrating\", and suggested it might have worked better if less focus had been put on integrating the film with the MCU. DeFore did praise Holland's performance as \"winning\" despite the script, and called Zendaya a scene-stealer.[272] Mick LaSalle, writing for the *San Francisco Chronicle*, said the film was a \"pretty good Spider-Man movie\" that \"breaks no new ground\", not exploring the human side of the character enough and instead focusing on action that is not thrilling.[273] At *The Telegraph*, Robbie Collin argued that \"a little of the new Spider-Man went an exhilaratingly long way in *Captain America: Civil War* last year. But a lot of him goes almost nowhere in this slack and spiritless solo escapade.\" Collin criticized Watts' direction but was positive of the cast, including Holland, Keaton, Tomei, and Zendaya.[274]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\n | Teen Choice Awards | Choice Breakout Movie Star\n | Tom Holland | Nominated\n | [275] |\n| Zendaya | Nominated\n |\n| Choice Summer Movie\n | *Spider-Man: Homecoming* | Won\n |\n| Choice Summer Movie Actor\n | Tom Holland | Won\n |\n| Choice Summer Movie Actress\n | Zendaya | Won\n |\n| Washington D.C.

Tom Holland stars as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Michael Keaton, Jon Favreau, Gwyneth Paltrow, Zendaya, Donald Glover, Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Bokeem Woodbine, Tyne Daly, Marisa Tomei, and Robert Downey Jr. In the film, Peter Parker tries to balance high school life with being Spider-Man while facing the Vulture (Keaton).\n\n\nIn February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony reached a deal to share the film rights for Spider-Man, integrating the character into the established MCU. The following June, Holland was cast as the title character, and Watts was hired to direct. This was followed shortly by the hiring of Daley and Goldstein. In April 2016, the film's title was revealed, along with additional cast, including Downey in his MCU role of Tony Stark / Iron Man. Principal photography began in June 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, and continued in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City. The other screenwriters were revealed during filming, which concluded in Berlin in October 2016. The production team made efforts to differentiate the film from previous Spider-Man films.\n\n\n*Spider-Man: Homecoming* premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 28, 2017, and was released in the United States on July 7, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. *Homecoming* grossed over $880 million worldwide, becoming the second-most-successful Spider-Man film and the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2017. It received praise for the light tone, its focus on Parker's high school life, and the performances, particularly of Holland and Keaton. Two sequels have been released: *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019) and *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (2021). A new trilogy of live-action films from Sony and Marvel Studios is in development.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the Battle of New York in 2012,[a] Adrian Toomes and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city, but their operation is taken over by the Department of Damage Control (DODC), a partnership between Tony Stark and the U.S. government. Enraged at being driven out of business, Toomes persuades his employees to keep the Chitauri technology they have already scavenged and use it to create and sell advanced weapons, including a flying Vulture suit Toomes uses to steal Chitauri power cells.\n\n\nEight years later,[b] Peter Parker is drafted into the Avengers by Stark to help with an internal dispute in Germany,[c] but resumes his studies at the Midtown School of Science and Technology when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full-time Avenger. Parker quits his school's academic decathlon team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. His best friend, Ned, eventually discovers his secret identity.\n\n\nParker comes across Toomes' associates Jackson Brice / Shocker and Herman Schultz selling weapons to local criminal Aaron Davis. Parker saves Davis before being caught by Toomes in the Vulture suit and dropped in a lake, nearly drowning after becoming tangled in a parachute built into his suit. He is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against further involvement with the criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of their weapons and Schultz becomes the new Shocker.\n\n\nParker and Ned study a weapon Brice left behind, removing its power core. When a tracking device on Schultz leads to Maryland, Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a DODC truck but is trapped inside, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, he races to the Washington Monument, where the core is activated and explodes, trapping Ned and their friends in an elevator. Parker saves them, including his classmate and crush Liz. Days later, in New York City, aboard the Staten Island Ferry, Parker captures Toomes' new buyer Mac Gargan but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers, but confiscates his suit as punishment for his recklessness.\n\n\nParker returns to his high school life and asks Liz to go to the homecoming dance with him. On the night of the dance, he discovers that Toomes is Liz's father. Deducing Parker's secret identity, Toomes threatens him. Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a DODC plane transporting weapons from Avengers Tower to the team's new headquarters in Upstate New York. He leaves the dance and dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit. Though he is ambushed outside by Schultz, he defeats him with Ned's help. He races to Toomes' lair, where Toomes attacks Parker, destroying the building's support columns, and leaves Parker to die, trapped in the rubble of the collapsed building. Parker escapes and intercepts the plane, steering it to crash on the beach at Coney Island. He and Toomes continue fighting, ending with Parker saving Toomes' life after the damaged Vulture suit explodes. Parker leaves Toomes for the police along with the plane's cargo. After her father's arrest, Liz moves away. Parker declines an invitation from Stark to join the Avengers full time, and Stark proposes to Pepper Potts. Stark also returns the Spider-Man suit to Parker, who puts it on just as his aunt May walks in.\n\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, an incarcerated Gargan approaches Toomes in prison, saying he has heard that the latter knows Spider-Man's real identity, though Toomes denies this.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)(L–R) Tom Holland, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Jacob Batalon, Zendaya, and director Jon Watts promoting *Spider-Man: Homecoming* at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con\n* Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:  \nA 15-year-old who gained spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[9] Producers Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal were impressed by Holland's performances in *The Impossible* (2012), *Wolf Hall* (2015), and *In the Heart of the Sea* (2015).[10] Holland took inspiration from previous Spider-Man actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, but also hoped to deliver something \"new and exciting\" with his take on the character,[11] the first to focus on Parker as \"dealing with everyday problems that a 15-year-old deals with as well as trying to save the city.\"[12] Holland attended The Bronx High School of Science in the Bronx for a few days to prepare for the role,[13] where other students did not believe he was cast as Spider-Man. Holland felt this would carry over well to the film, where other characters do not suspect Parker of being Spider-Man.[14] It took 25 to 45 minutes for Holland to get into costume, depending on if he had to wear a stunt harness underneath the suit.[13] Holland initially signed for six MCU films, including three Spider-Man films.[15]\n* Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes / Vulture:  \nA salvager-turned-arms-trafficker after his company is forced out of business. He uses a suit with mechanical wings forged from Chitauri technology.[16] Toomes is revealed to be the father of Liz, Parker's love interest.[17] Director Jon Watts wanted him to be a \"regular guy\", closer to John C. Reilly's Nova Corpsman Rhomann Dey from *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014) than other MCU villains like Thanos and Ultron, to go with Spider-Man as a \"regular kid who becomes a superhero\".[16][18] This helped avoid Toomes drawing the attention of the Avengers, and provided someone that Parker would be able to defeat while still learning to use his abilities.[19] Keaton said Toomes was not completely villainous, as \"there's parts of him that you go, 'You know what? I might see his point.'\"[20] Co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll likened Toomes to \"the dark Tony Stark\",[16] a \"businessman with a family. He wants to look out for his kids ... He doesn't have these big delusions of grandeur where he wants to take over the world, or replace the government, or even defeat the Avengers or anything. He just wants his shot at the good life.\"[21] Keaton was not hesitant to portray another comic book character after playing Batman in Tim Burton's 1989 film and its 1992 sequel.[20]\n* Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan:  \nThe former head of security for Stark Industries and Tony Stark's driver and bodyguard.[22] Hogan is \"looking after\" Parker in the film, with Favreau saying that Parker \"needs someone to help him out\".[23] Favreau previously portrayed Hogan in the *Iron Man* films, having also directed the first two of those, and described returning as just an actor as fun, allowing him \"to maintain the relationship with the MCU ... Especially when the filmmakers are taking care of you, and taking care of the characters and the story.\"[24]\n* Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts: Tony Stark's fiancée and the CEO of Stark Industries.[25]\n* Zendaya as Michelle:  \nOne of Parker's classmates, also known as \"MJ\".[26][27] Zendaya, calling her awkward but intellectual, said that \"she just feels like she doesn't need to talk to people\" because of her intelligence.[28] She added that it was \"refreshing\" that Michelle was weird and different, feeling that \"a lot of young people—especially young women—can relate to that.\"[29] Watts likened the character to Ally Sheedy's Allison Reynolds from *The Breakfast Club* (1985) or Linda Cardellini's Lindsay Weir from *Freaks and Geeks* (1999–2000).[21] The character is not a direct adaptation of Mary Jane Watson, but was given the initials \"MJ\" to \"remind you of that dynamic\",[30] with the writers \"plant[ing] the seeds in this movie\" for comparisons to Watson, but also making her \"wholly different\".[31] Feige added that Michelle is \"not obsessed with\" Parker like Watson is at times in the comics, \"she's just observant\".[30] Her full name, Michelle Jones-Watson, was revealed in the sequel *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (2021).[32]\n* Donald Glover as Aaron Davis:  \nA criminal looking to purchase weapons from Toomes.[33][34] Davis is the uncle of Miles Morales, an inheritor of the Spider-Man mantle, in the comics. Glover voiced Morales in the *Ultimate Spider-Man* television series, and campaigned to portray Spider-Man in a film in 2010. Watts was aware of the campaign, and as soon as he was hired he asked Feige about casting Glover. The role was designed as \"a surprise treat for fans\", with Davis mentioning his nephew to set up Morales potentially appearing in a future MCU film.[34] Watts insisted Glover accept the part, assuring him that if he declined the offer, he would have scrapped Davis from the film.[35]\n* Jacob Batalon as Ned:  \nParker's best friend,[26][36][37] who is a \"complete gamer\".[38] Batalon described him as \"the quintessential best guy, the best man, the number two guy, the guy in the chair\" for Parker.[39] Marvel used Ned Leeds as a basis for the character, who does not have a last name in the script or film, but essentially created their own character with him. Carroll said that Ned and other characters in the film are composites of several of their favorites from Spider-Man comics,[37] notably Ganke Lee, who is Miles Morales' best friend in *Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man*.[40] He is given the last name \"Leeds\" in the sequel *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019),[41] which was confirmed in *No Way Home*.[32]\n* Laura Harrier as Liz: A senior, Parker's love interest, and Toomes' daughter,[42][43] with a \"type-A\" personality.[21]\n* Tony Revolori as Flash:  \nParker's rival and classmate.[43][44] It was noted that the character is generally depicted as a white bully in the comics; the Guatemalan American actor received death threats upon his casting.[43][45] Revolori worked hard \"to do him justice\", as he is an important character to the fans.[43] Rather than being a physically imposing jock, Flash Thompson was re-imagined as \"a rich, smug kid\" to reflect modern views of bullying,[46] by crafting him more into a social media bully and rival for Parker opposed to a jock;[45] this depiction was largely informed by Holland's visit to The Bronx High School of Science.[13] Revolori said that Flash has to work hard to match Parker's intelligence, which is \"one of the reasons he doesn't like Peter. Everyone else seems to like Peter, so he's like, why don't they like me like they like him?\" Revolori gained 60 lb (27 kg) for the role.[45]\n* Bokeem Woodbine as Herman Schultz / Shocker: An accomplice of Toomes' who is the second person to use modified, vibro-blast shooting versions of Brock Rumlow's gauntlets.[47][21]\n* Tyne Daly as Anne Marie Hoag: The head of the U.S. Department of Damage Control.[48][49]\n* Marisa Tomei as May Parker:  \nPeter's aunt.[50][51] First reports of Tomei's casting caused backlash on social media, with comic book fans opining that the actress was \"too young and attractive to portray the character\",[52] especially after the character had previously been depicted by actresses older than Tomei. Regarding the casting, *Captain America: Civil War* (2016) co-writer Stephen McFeely said that, for the MCU, they were trying to make Peter \"as naturalistic as possible...That's partly why his aunt isn't 80 years old; if she's the sister of his dead mother, why does she have to be two generations ahead?\"[53] Carroll added that the creative team was looking for more of a \"big sister\" or someone closer in age to Peter Parker in the casting process.[54] After researching the character, Tomei did make \"a case to age me up, but no they didn't do it\".[55] Tomei felt there was a \"blank slate\" from which she could develop the character, and talked to Watts about May being \"a community organizer or invested in the neighborhood\" to indicate where Peter's values come from.[56]\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:  \nA self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own invention who is Parker's mentor and the creator of the U.S. Department of Damage Control.[21][57] Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group chairman Tom Rothman noted that, beyond the commercial advantage of featuring Downey in the film, the inclusion of Stark was important due to the relationship established between him and Parker in *Captain America: Civil War*.[58] Watts noted that after Stark's actions in *Civil War*, introducing Parker to life as an Avenger, there are \"a lot of repercussions to that. Is it a first step towards Tony as some sort of mentor figure? Is he comfortable with that?\"[59] Co-writer Jonathan Goldstein compared Stark to Ethan Hawke's father character in *Boyhood* (2014).[19]\n\n\nAdditionally, Kerry Condon and Chris Evans reprise their roles as F.R.I.D.A.Y. and Steve Rogers / Captain America from previous MCU films, respectively.[60][61] Rogers appears in public service announcements played at Parker's school.[61] Garcelle Beauvais portrays Doris Toomes, Adrian's wife and Liz's mother,[62][63] and Jennifer Connelly provides the voice of Karen, the A.I. in Parker's suit.[60] Hemky Madera appears as Mr. Delmar, the owner of a local bodega, while Gary Weeks portrays Damage Control agent Foster.[64] Logan Marshall-Green plays Jackson Brice, the first Shocker, who is an accomplice of Toomes' who uses modified, vibro-blast shooting versions of Brock Rumlow's gauntlets.[21][65][66] Other business partners of Toomes' include: Michael Chernus as Phineas Mason,[16][67] Michael Mando as Mac Gargan,[49][68] and Christopher Berry as Randy Vale.[64][69]\n\n\nFaculty at Parker's high school include: Kenneth Choi, who previously played Jim Morita in the MCU, as Jim's descendant Principal Morita;[66][70] Hannibal Buress as Coach Wilson,[71] the school's gym teacher, who he described as \"one of the dumbass characters that don't realize [Parker is] Spider-Man\";[72][73] Martin Starr, who reprises his previously unnamed role from *The Incredible Hulk* (2008),[74] as Mr. Harrington,[66] a teacher and academic decathlon coach;[75][76] Selenis Leyva as Ms. Warren;[77][78] Tunde Adebimpe as Mr. Cobbwell;[64] and John Penick as Mr. Hapgood.[79] Parker's classmates include: Isabella Amara as Sally;[80][81] Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as Jason Ionello;[80][82] Josie Totah[d] as Seymour;[80][83] Abraham Attah as Abraham;[66][84] Tiffany Espensen as Cindy;[62][85] Angourie Rice as Betty Brant;[86][87] Michael Barbieri as Charles;[82][88][89] and Ethan Dizon as Tiny.[82] Martha Kelly appears in the film as a tour guide,[64][90] Zach Cherry appears as a street vendor who asks Spider-Man to \"do a flip\",[91] and Kirk Thatcher makes a cameo appearance as a \"punk\", an homage to his role in *Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home* (1986).[92] Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee also has a cameo, as a New York City apartment resident named Gary who witnesses Parker's confrontation with a neighbor.[93][94]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Amazing Spider-Man 2 § Cancelled sequels and spin-offs\n\n> \n> There are so many things from the comics that haven't been done yet ... stories [that Spider-Man is] in high school for a lot of it.

That also makes him very, very different from any of our other characters in the MCU\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Kevin Feige, President of Marvel Studios[95]\n\nFollowing the November 2014 hacking of Sony's computers, emails between Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman Amy Pascal and president Doug Belgrad were released, stating that Sony wanted Marvel Studios to produce a new trilogy of Spider-Man films while Sony retained \"creative control, marketing, and distribution\". Discussions between Sony and Marvel broke down, and Sony planned to proceed with its own slate of Spider-Man films.[96] However, in February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that they would release a new Spider-Man film, with Kevin Feige and Pascal producing (the latter through her company Pascal Pictures).[97][98] The character would first appear in an earlier Marvel Cinematic Universe film,[97] later revealed to be *Captain America: Civil War* (2016).[99] Marvel Studios would explore opportunities to integrate MCU characters into future Spider-Man films, which Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, and have final creative control over.[97] Both studios have the ability to terminate the agreement at any point, and no money was exchanged with the deal. However, a small adjustment was made to a 2011 deal that gave Marvel full control of Spider-Man's merchandising rights, in exchange for a one-time payment of $175 million to Sony and paying up to $35 million for each future Spider-Man film rather than receiving their previous five percent of a Spider-Man film's revenue—Marvel could now reduce their $35 million payment if the co-produced film grossed more than $750 million.[100] Marvel Studios still received five percent of first dollar gross for the film.[101] Lone Star Funds also co-financed the film with Sony, via its LSC Film Corporation deal,[102] covering 25 percent of the $175 million budget,[103] while Columbia Pictures officially served as co-producer with Marvel Studios.[104] Sony also paid Marvel Studios an undisclosed producer fee.[105]\n\n\nMarvel had been working to add Spider-Man to the Marvel Cinematic Universe since at least October 2014, when they announced their slate of Phase Three films, with Feige saying, \"Marvel doesn't announce anything officially until it's set in stone. So we went forward with that Plan A in October, with the Plan B being, if [the deal] were to happen with Sony, how it would all shift. We've been thinking about [the Spider-Man film] as long as we've been thinking about Phase Three.\"[106] Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach, producers for *The Amazing Spider-Man* series, were set to serve as executive producers,[107] with neither director Marc Webb nor actor Andrew Garfield returning for the new film.[108] Sony was reportedly looking for an actor younger than Garfield to play Spider-Man,[107] with Logan Lerman and Dylan O'Brien considered front-runners.[109] In March 2015, Drew Goddard was being considered to write and direct the film,[110][111] while O'Brien said he had not been approached for the role.[112] Goddard, who was previously attached to a Sony film based on the Sinister Six, later said he declined to work on the new film as he thought he \"didn't really have an idea\" for it and struggled with the idea of working on a new film after spending a year working on the Sinister Six film and being in that mindset.[113] The following month, while promoting *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), Feige said the character of Peter Parker would be around 15 to 16 years old in the film,[95] which would not be an origin story, since \"there have been two retellings of that origin in the last [thirteen years, so] we are going to take it for granted that people know that, and the specifics\".[106] Parker's Uncle Ben is still referenced in the film,[114] but not by name.[115] There was some discussion to include a direct reference to Ben when Peter is getting ready for his homecoming by the revelation that his wardrobe consisted of Ben's clothes, but the writers desisted because they felt that the moment veered away from Parker's character arc and made Ben's death feel like a \"throwaway line\".[116] Later in April, Nat Wolff, Asa Butterfield, Tom Holland, Timothée Chalamet, and Liam James were under consideration by Sony and Marvel to play Spider-Man,[117] with Holland and Butterfield as the front-runners.[118]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Jonathan Levine, Ted Melfi, Jason Moore, the writing team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, and Jared Hess were being considered to direct the film.[119] Butterfield, Holland, Judah Lewis, Matt Lintz, Charlie Plummer, and Charlie Rowe screen tested for the lead role against Robert Downey Jr., who portrays Tony Stark / Iron Man in the MCU, for \"chemistry\".[120][121] The six were chosen out of a search of over 1,500 actors to test in front of Feige, Pascal, and the Russo brothers—the directors of *Captain America: Civil War*.[121] Lintz would later be cast as Bruno Carrelli in the Marvel Studios Disney+ series *Ms. Marvel* (2022).[122] By early June 2015, Levine and Melfi had become the favorites to direct the film, with Daley and Goldstein, and Jon Watts also in consideration,[123] while Feige and Pascal narrowed the actors considered to Holland and Rowe, with both screen testing with Downey again. Holland also tested with Chris Evans, who portrays Steve Rogers / Captain America in the MCU, and emerged as the favorite.[120] On June 23, Marvel and Sony officially announced that Holland would star as Spider-Man and that Watts would direct the film.[10] The Russos \"were pretty vocal about who [*sic*] [they] wanted for the part\", pushing to cast an actor close to the age of Peter Parker to differentiate from the previous portrayals. They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background.[99] Watts was able to read the *Civil War* script, talk with the Russos, and was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes in that film.[115] He was able to \"see what they were doing with it\" and provide \"ideas about this and that\",[124] including what Parker's bedroom and wardrobe looked like \"so that my movie transitions seamlessly with theirs\".[115] On joining the MCU and directing the film, Watts said he was excited to explore the \"ground level\" of the MCU, a world where characters like the Avengers exist but have only been depicted in previous films at \"the Penthouse level of the Marvel world\".[21]\n\n\nBefore getting the job of director, Watts created images of Nick Fury as Parker's mentor in the story in early \"mood reels\" saying, \"I don't know what the situation would be, but that would be a person he'd want to get in trouble with.\"[125] Feige said the films of John Hughes would be a major influence and that Parker's personal growth and development would be just as important as his role as Spider-Man. He noted that \"at that age, in high school, everything feels like life or death\". He also said that the film hoped to use one of Spider-Man's rogues that have not been seen in film yet,[126] and that filming would begin in June 2016.[127] In July 2015, it was reported that Marisa Tomei had been offered the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt.[50] It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay,[128] and were given three days to present Marvel with their pitch;[129] both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay.[130] The pair had proposed a take on the character that was \"diametrically opposed\" to the previous Spider-Man films, creating a laundry list of all the elements seen in those films and actively trying to avoid re-using them. They chose to focus on the high school aspects of the character rather than the \"drama and weight of the tragedy that leads to the origin of Spider-Man\". They felt this would differentiate him from the other MCU superheroes as well.[19] Daley said the film was about Parker \"finding his place\" in the MCU, with the writing team wanting the film to focus on him \"coming to terms with his new abilities and not yet being good with them, and carrying with him some real human fears and weaknesses\", such as a fear of heights when he has to scale the Washington Monument. Daley noted, \"Even within the context of this movie, I don't think you would feel that fear of heights or even the vertigo the audience feels in that scene if you establish him as swinging from skyscrapers at the top of the movie.\"[17] The writers also wanted to avoid the skyscrapers of Manhattan because of how often they were used in the other films, and instead wrote the character into locations such as \"the suburbs, on a golf course, the Staten Island Ferry, Coney Island, and even Washington, D.C.\" One of the first sequences they pitched was \"seeing Spider-Man attached to a plane 10,000 feet up in the air, where he had absolutely no safety net. ... you're familiar with the sort of areas he's been in, [so] why not turn it on its head and make it something different that people haven't seen before?\"[19] The pair conceded that the film took a more grounded, \"low-stakes\" approach than previous films, which avoided having to explain why the Avengers were not helping, since a world-threatening problem would logically require the \"big guys\".[17]\n\n\nMarvel encouraged Daley and Goldstein to express their own sense of humor in the script, with Daley saying, \"When you're seeing the world through the eyes of a fun, funny kid, you can really embrace that voice, and not give him the cookie-cutter one-liners that you're so accustomed to hearing from Peter Parker.\" Inspired by their experiences working on sitcoms, the writers also looked to create \"a network of strong characters\" to surround Parker with in the film.[19] In October 2015, Watts said he was looking to make the film a coming-of-age story to see the growth of Parker, citing *Can't Buy Me Love* (1987), *Say Anything...* (1989), and *Almost Famous* (2000) as some of his favorite films in that genre.[131] It was this aspect of the film that had initially got Watts interested in directing it, as he had already been looking to make a coming-of-age story when he heard that the new Spider-Man would be younger than previous incarnations.[132] Watts re-read the original Spider-Man comics in preparation for the film, and \"came to a new realization\" about the character's original popularity, feeling that he introduced a new perspective to the comics that had already established \"a crazy spectacular Marvel Universe ... to give a regular person's perspective on it\". He felt that this was also the responsibility of this film since it had to introduce Spider-Man to the already established MCU.[115] Specific comics that Watts noted as potential influences were *Ultimate Spider-Man* and *Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane*.[132] In December, Oliver Scholl signed on to be the production designer for the film.[133]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Watts promoting *Spider-Man: Homecoming* at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con\nWatts wanted to heavily pre-visualize the film, especially its action sequences, as he does on all his films. For *Homecoming*, Watts worked with a team to \"figure out the visual language for the action sequences and ... try stuff out before\" filming began to help Watts practice given his lack of experience working on large-scale films. For the \"web-slinging\" sequences, Watts wanted to avoid the big \"swoopy\" camera moves that had been previously used and instead \"keep it all as grounded as possible. So, whether it was shooting with a drone camera or a helicopter or a cable-cam, or even just handheld, up on a roof chasing after him, I wanted it to feel like we were there with him.\"[132]\n\n\nIn January 2016, Sony shifted the film's release date from July 28, 2017, to July 7, 2017,[134] and said the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3D in post-production.[135] J. K. Simmons expressed interest in reprising his role as J. Jonah Jameson from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* films.[136] In early March, Zendaya was cast in the film as Michelle, and Tomei was confirmed as May Parker.[51][137] The following month, Feige confirmed that characters from previous MCU films would appear,[138] and clarified that the deal formed with Sony does not specify which characters can and cannot crossover.[139] He noted that the sharing between the studios was done with \"good faith\" in order \"to have more toys to play with as we put together a story\",[7] and that \"the agreement was that it is very much a Sony Pictures movie... we are the creative producers. We are the ones hiring the actor, introducing him in [*Civil War*], and then working right now on the script and soon to be shooting.\"[139] Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman further added that Sony has final greenlight authority, but were deferring creatively to Marvel.[140] At CinemaCon 2016, Sony announced the title of the film to be *Spider-Man: Homecoming*,[141][142] a reference to the common high school tradition homecoming as well as the character \"coming home\" to Marvel and the MCU.[142] Tony Revolori – who had auditioned for Peter Parker[143] – and Laura Harrier joined the cast as classmates of Parker's,[42][144] and Downey Jr. was revealed to be in the film as Stark.[57][145] Watts noted that Stark \"was always a part of\" the film's story because of his interactions with Parker in *Civil War*.[132] Downey Jr. was paid $10 million for his involvement.[146]\n\n\nAlso in April, Michael Keaton entered talks to play a villain,[147] but dropped out of discussions shortly thereafter due to scheduling conflicts with *The Founder* (2016).[148][149] At this point, John Leguizamo was approached to fill the role and entered negotiations to do so.[150] Keaton soon reentered talks for the role after a change in schedule for *The Founder*,[149][151] which necessitated Marvel to ask Leguizamo if he would step away from the role in order to cast Keaton;[150] Keaton closed the deal in late May.[151] Marvel offered to cast Leguizamo in another role, which he considered \"tiny\" and declined.[150] Mark Hamill was interested in playing the film's villain in case Keaton turned down the offer, but Keaton reconsidered the offer in time.[152] In June, Michael Barbieri was cast as a friend of Parker's,[88][89] Kenneth Choi was cast as Parker's high school principal,[70] and Logan Marshall-Green was cast as another villain alongside Keaton's character,[65][68] while Donald Glover and Martin Starr joined the cast in undisclosed roles.[33][75] Watts said that he wanted the cast to reflect Queens as \"one of [the] most diverse places in the world\",[124] with Feige adding that \"we want everyone to recognize themselves in every portion of our universe. [With this cast] especially, it really feels like this is absolutely what has to happen and continue.\"[43] This is also different from the previous films, which were \"set in a lily-white Queens high school\".[153] Additionally, Marvel made a conscious decision to mostly avoid including or referencing characters who appeared in previous *Spider-Man* films, outside of major ones like Peter and May Parker, and Flash Thompson. This included the *Daily Bugle*, with co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll saying, \"We toyed with it for a while, but again, we didn't want to go down that road right away, and if we do do a *Daily Bugle*, we want to do it in a way that feels contemporary\".[114] This also included the character Mary Jane Watson, but Zendaya's Michelle was eventually given the initials \"MJ\" as a nod to that character. Feige said that the point of this is \"to have fun with [references] while at the same time having it be different characters that can provide a different dynamic\".[30]\n\n\nSpider-Man's costume in the film has more technical improvements than the previous suits, including the logo on the chest being a remote drone, an AI system similar to Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S., a holographic interface, a parachute, a tracking device for Stark to track Parker, a heater, an airbag, the ability to light up, and the ability to augment reality with the eyepieces. Stark also builds in a \"training wheels\" protocol, to initially limit Parker's access to all of its features. Carroll noted Marvel went through the comics and \"pull[ed] out all the sort of fun and wacky things the suit did\" to include in the *Homecoming* suit.[154] Spider-Man's web-shooters have various settings, first teased at the end of *Civil War*, which Carroll explained allowed him to \"adjust the spray\" to different settings like the spinning web, web ball, or ricochet web. He compared this to a DSLR camera.[114]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on June 20, 2016,[155] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[156] under the working title *Summer of George*.[157] Salvatore Totino served as director of photography.[158] Filming also took place in Atlanta, with locations including Grady High School,[159] Downtown Atlanta,[160] the Atlanta Marriott Marquis,[161] Piedmont Park, the Georgia World Congress Center,[162] and the West End neighborhood.[163] Holland said building New York sets in Atlanta was cheaper than actually filming in New York, a location closely associated with the character, though the production may \"end up [in New York] for one week or two\".[164] A replica of the Staten Island Ferry was built in Atlanta, with the ability to open and close in half in 10 to 12 seconds and be flooded with 40,000 gallons of water in 8 seconds.[165] Additional filming also occurred at two magnet schools in the Van Nuys and Reseda neighborhoods of Los Angeles.[166]\n\n\nCasting continued after the start of production, with the inclusion of Isabella Amara, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., Josie Totah,[80] Hannibal Buress,[72] Selenis Leyva,[77] Abraham Attah,[84] Michael Mando,[68] Tyne Daly,[48] Garcelle Beauvais, Tiffany Espensen,[62] and Angourie Rice in unspecified roles,[86] with Bokeem Woodbine joining as an additional villain.[47] At San Diego Comic-Con International 2016, Marvel confirmed the castings of Keaton, Zendaya, Glover, Harrier, Revolori, Daly, and Woodbine, while revealing Zendaya, Harrier, and Revolori's roles as Michelle, Liz Allan, and Flash Thompson, respectively,[26][36][43][167] and announcing the casting of Jacob Batalon as Ned.[36][37] It was also revealed that the Vulture would be the film's villain, while the writing teams of Watts and Christopher Ford, and Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, joined Goldstein and Daley in writing the screenplay,[36] from Goldstein and Daley's story. Eric Pearson, a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the Marvel One-Shot films, did uncredited work on the film as well.[168] Watts praised Goldstein and Daley's drafts as \"really fun and funny\", and said that they \"sort of established the broad strokes of the movie\", with him and Ford, close friends since childhood, then re-writing the script based on specific ideas that Watts had and things that he wanted to film, which he said was a \"pretty substantial structural pass, rearranging things and building it into the sort of story arc we wanted it to be.\" McKenna and Sommers then joined the film to deal with changes to the script during filming, as \"it's all a little bit flexible when you get to set. You try things out, and you just need someone to be writing while you're shooting.\"[132]\n\n\nHarrier noted that the young actors in the film \"constantly refer to ourselves as *The Breakfast Club*\".[26] Shortly after, Martha Kelly joined the cast in an unspecified role.[90] In August, Michael Chernus was cast as Phineas Mason / Tinkerer,[67] while Jona Xiao joined the cast in an unspecified role,[169] and Buress said he was playing a gym teacher.[73] By September 2016, Jon Favreau was reprising his role as Happy Hogan from the *Iron Man* series,[22] and filming concluded in Atlanta and moved to New York City. Locations in the latter area included Astoria, Queens, St. George, Staten Island, Manhattan,[170][171][172] and Franklin K. Lane High School in Brooklyn.[114] Additionally, UFC fighter Tyron Woodley said he had been considered for a villain role in the film, but had to drop out due to a prior commitment with Fox Sports.[173] Principal photography wrapped on October 2, 2016, in New York City,[174] with some additional filming taking place later in the month in Berlin, Germany, near the Brandenburg Gate.[175]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2016, Feige confirmed that Keaton would play Adrian Toomes / Vulture,[18][176] while Woodbine was revealed as Herman Schultz / Shocker.[21][177] In March 2017, Harrier said the film was undergoing re-shoots,[178] and Evans was set to appear as Steve Rogers / Captain America in an instructional fitness video.[61] Watts was inspired by The President's Fitness Challenge for this, feeling that Captain America would be the obvious version of that for the MCU. He then started brainstorming other public service announcements (PSA) starring Captain America, about \"just anything you could think of, we had poor Captain America do it\". Watts said that many of the additional PSA videos would be featured on the home media of the film.[179] According to Goldstein, additional videos featuring other Avengers were planned at some point.[180] Watts confirmed that the company Stark creates that leads Toomes on his villainous path in the film is Damage Control, which Watts felt \"just fit in with our overall philosophy with the kind of story we wanted to tell\" and created a lot of practical questions Watts wanted to use \"to drive the story\".[59]\n\n\nThe film features multiple post-credit scenes.[59][181] The first gives the Vulture a chance at redemption, showing him protect Parker from another villain. Watts said this \"was a really interesting thing in the development of the story. You couldn't just rely on the tropes of the villain being a murderer and killing a bunch of people. He had to be redeemable in some capacity in the end and that he believes everything he said, especially about his family.\" The second post-credits scene is an additional Captain America PSA, where he talks about the value of patience—a meta-referential joke at the expense of the audience, who have just waited through the film's credits to see the scene.[182] This was a \"last-minute addition\" to the film.[183] Watts completed work on *Homecoming* at the beginning of June 2017, approving the final visual effects shots. He stated that he had never been told that he could not do something by Marvel or Sony, saying, \"You assume you'll have to fight for every little weird thing you wanna do, but I didn't really ever run into that. I got to do kind of everything I wanted to.\"[132] That month, Starr explained that he was playing the academic decathlon coach at Parker's high school,[76] and Marshall-Green was said to be portraying another Shocker.[184]\n\n\nIn July, Feige discussed specific moments in the film, including an homage to *The Amazing Spider-Man* issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige \"wanted to see in a movie for a long, long time\".[185] Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, \"We have [Parker] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem.\"[17] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of *Iron Man* (2008) when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, \"What does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique.\"[186] Goldstein added that it \"diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [and] lets her become part of what's really his life.\"[17] Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, feeling that if it did not work, the film would not work. The team \"worked backwards and forwards from that moment ... You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [and it] doesn't seem like something out of left field\".[185] Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, \"more than anything else, [what] I was looking forward to, and I got to have a lot of fun shooting that stuff\".[182] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were \"giddy when we first came up with [that twist], because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time.\"[17]\n\n\n\n#### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Trixter used a LIDAR scan of Grand Central Terminal from *The Avengers* to help create their CGI version (bottom), adding to the elements filmed on set (top).[187]\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Marvel Studios' Spider-Man: Homecoming End Credits Final Main on End Title Sequence presents the film's main-on-end title sequence, YouTube video from Perception's channel |\n\n\nVisual effects for the film were completed by Sony Pictures Imageworks, Industrial Light & Magic, Luma Pictures, Digital Domain, Cantina Creative, Iloura, Trixter,[188] and Method Studios.[165] Executive producer Victoria Alonso initially did not want Imageworks, which worked on all previous Spider-Man films, to work on *Homecoming*, in order to give it a different look than those earlier films. She changed her mind after seeing what she called \"phenomenal\" test material from the vendor.[189] The film's main-on-end title sequence was designed by Perception.[190]\n\n\nTrixter contributed over 300 shots for the film, including the opening scene at Grand Central Terminal, the sequence that retells the events of *Civil War* from Parker's perspective, the sequence where Toomes takes Liz and Parker to the dance, the school battle between Parker and Schultz, and the scene around and within the Avengers compound. They also worked on both Spider-Man suits and the spider tracer. Trixter created additional salvage workers to populate the Grand Central scene, whose clothes and proportions were able to be altered to create variation. For the battle between Parker and Schultz, Trixter used an all-digital Spider-Man in his homemade suit, which came from Imageworks, with Trixter applying a rigging, muscle, and cloth system to it \"to mimic the appearance of the rather loose training suit\". They also created the effects for Schultz's gauntlets and had to change the setting from the Atlanta set to Queens, by using a CGI school and adding 360 degrees of matte paintings for the mid to far-distance elements. Trixter received concept art and basic geometry that was used previously for the Avengers compound, but ended up remodeling it for the way it appears in *Homecoming*. Models and textures for Spider-Man's Avengers costume were created by Framestore for use in a future MCU film, with Trixter creating the vault that it appears in. Trixter VFX supervisor Dominik Zimmerle said the idea was \"to have a clean, high tech, presentation Vault for the new suit. It should appear distinctively 'Stark' originated\".[187]\n\n\nDigital Domain worked on the Staten Island Ferry battle, creating the CGI versions of Spider-Man, the Vulture suit, Iron Man, and Spider-Man's drone. Digital Domain was able to LIDAR an actual Staten Island Ferry, as well as the version created on set, to help with creating their digital version.[165] Lou Pecora, visual effects supervisor at Digital Domain, called that sequence \"brutal\" because \"the way they were shot, it was lit to be a certain time of day, and afterwards it was decided to change that time of day.\"[191] Sony Pictures Imageworks created much of the third act of the film when Parker confronts Toomes on the plane and beach in his homemade suit, and Toomes is in an upgraded Vulture suit. Some elements of Vulture's first suit were shared with Imageworks, but the remainder were created by them \"based on a maquette\". For the plane's cloaking ability, Imageworks was inspired by Adaptiv IR Camouflage tank cloaking system by BAE Systems, which \"uses a series of titles to cloak against infrared\". For their web design, which was based on the one created for *Civil War*, Digital Domain referenced polar bear hair because of its translucent nature. Imageworks also looked to the *Civil War* webs, as well as to those they had created for previous Spider-Man films, in which \"the web[s] had [...] tiny barbs that aided in hooking on to things.\" For this film, they \"dialed back the barbs\" to line up more closely with the other web designs created for this film.[165] Method Studios worked on the Washington Monument sequence.[189] Iron Man's armor in the film, the Mark XLVII, is a recolored version of the MK XLVI armor introduced in *Civil War*; this was done because Sony did not have the budget to create a new Iron Man suit. Feige requested the color scheme resemble the Ultimate Iron Man armor from the comics.[192]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spider-Man: Homecoming (soundtrack)\n\nWhile promoting *Doctor Strange* in early November 2016, Feige accidentally revealed that Michael Giacchino, who composed the music for that film, would compose the score for *Homecoming* as well. Giacchino soon confirmed this himself.[193] Recording for the soundtrack began on April 11, 2017.[194] The score includes the theme from the 1960s animated series.[195] The soundtrack was released by Sony Masterworks on July 7, 2017.[196]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nWatts, Holland, Batalon, Harrier, Revolori, and Zendaya appeared at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con to show an exclusive clip of the film,[36][197] which also had a panel at Comic Con Experience 2016.[198] The first trailer for *Homecoming* premiered on *Jimmy Kimmel Live!* on December 8, 2016,[199] and was released online alongside an international version, which Feige thought was different enough that \"it would be fun for people to see both.\"[18] The shots of Vulture descending through a hotel atrium and Spider-Man swinging with Iron Man flying beside him were created specifically for the trailer. Watts explained that the Vulture shot was created for Comic-Con and \"was never meant to be in the movie\", but he was able to repurpose the angle for Vulture's reveal in the film. The Spider-Man and Iron Man shot was created because the marketing team wanted a shot of the two together, and existing shots \"just didn't look that great\" then. The trailer shot used a background plate taken when filming the subway in Queens.[115] The two trailers were viewed over 266 million times globally within a week.[103]\n\n\nOn March 28, 2017, a second trailer debuted after screening at CinemaCon 2017 the night before.[200] Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at *BoxOffice.com*, noted that the new *Justice League* trailer had received more Twitter mentions in that week but there was \"clearer enthusiasm for *Spider-Man*\". The *Homecoming* trailer was second for the week of March 20–26 in new conversations (85,859) behind *Justice League* (201,267), according to comScore's PreAct service, which is \"a tracking service utilizing social data to create context of the ever-evolving role of digital communication on feature films\".[201] An exclusive clip from the film was seen during the 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards.[202] On May 24, Sony and Marvel released a third domestic and international trailer.[203] Ethan Anderton of /Film enjoyed both trailers, stating *Homecoming* \"has the potential to be the best Spider-Man movie yet. Having the webslinger as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe just feels right\".[204] TechCrunch's Darrell Etherington agreed, saying, \"You may have feelings about a tech-heavy Spider-Man suit or other aspects of this interpretation of the character, but it's still shaping up to be better than any Spider-Man depicted in movies in recent memory.\"[205] Ana Dumaraog for Screen Rant said the second trailer \"arguably showed too much of the movie's overarching narrative\", but the third \"perfectly shows the right amount of new and old footage\". She also appreciated the attention to detail that Watts and the writers put into the film, as highlighted by the trailers.[206] Siddhant Adlakha of Birth.Movies.Death also felt the trailers were giving away too many details,[207] but enjoyed them overall, especially the \"vlogging\" aspect.[208] Collider's Dave Trombore expressed similar sentiments to Adlakha.[209] After the trailers' release, comScore and its PreAct service noted *Homecoming* was the top film for new social media conversations, that week and the week of May 29.[210][211]\n\n\nAlongside the release of the third trailers were domestic and international release posters.[203] The domestic poster was criticized for its \"floating head\" style,[207][212] which offers \"a chaotic mess of people looking in different directions, with little sense of what the film will deliver\".[212] Dan Auty for GameSpot called it a \"star studded hot mess\",[212] while *Vanity Fair*'s Katey Rich felt the poster was \"too bogged down by the many different threads of the Marvel universe to highlight anything that's made *Spider-Man: Homecoming* seem special so far\".[213] Adlakha felt the posters released for the film \"have been alright thus far, but these ones probably tell general audiences to expect a very bloated movie\". Adlakha was more positive of the international poster, which he felt was more \"comicbook-y\" and \"looks like it could be an actual scene from the film\".[207] Both Rich and Adlakha criticized the fact that Holland, Keaton, and Downey appeared twice on the domestic poster, both in and out of costume.[207][213] Sony partnered with ESPN CreativeWorks to create cross-promotional television ads for *Homecoming* and the 2017 NBA Finals, which were filmed by Watts. The ads were made to \"weave in a highlight from the game just moments\" after it occurred.[214] The promos see Holland, Downey Jr., and Favreau reprise their roles from the film, with cameo appearances from Stan Lee, DJ Khaled, Tim Duncan, Magic Johnson, and Cari Champion.[103] Through June and July 2017, a *Homecoming*-inspired cafe opened in the Roppongi Hills complex in Tokyo, offering \"arachnid-themed foods and drinks, including a Spider Curry, Spider-Sense Latte and a sweet and refreshing Strawberry Spider Squash drink\", as well as a free, limited-edition sticker with any purchase.[215]\n\n\nFor the week ending on June 11, comScore and its PreAct service noted that new social media conversations for the film were second only to *Black Panther* and its new trailer;[216] *Homecoming* was then the number one film in the next two weeks.[217][218] That month, Sony released a mobile app allowing users to \"access\" Parker's phone and \"view his photos, videos, text messages, and hear voicemails from his friends\". The app also provided an \"AR Suit Explorer\" to learn more about the technology in the Spider-Man suit, and use photo filters, GIFs, and stickers of the character.[219] Sony and Dave & Buster's also announced an arcade game based on the film, playable exclusively at Dave & Buster's locations.[220] A tie-in comic, *Spider-Man: Homecoming Prelude*, was released on June 20, collecting two prelude issues.[221] On June 28, in partnership with Thinkmodo, a promotional prank was released in which Spider-Man (stuntman Chris Silcox) dropped from the ceiling in a coffee shop to scare customers; the video also featured a cameo appearance from Lee.[222] Sony also partnered with the mobile app Holo to let users add 3D holograms of Spider-Man, with Holland's voice and lines from the film, to real-world photos and videos.[223] Before the end of June, *Spider-Man: Homecoming—Virtual Reality Experience* was released on the PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive for free, produced by Sony Pictures VR and developed by CreateVR. It allows users to experience how it feels to be Spider-Man, with the ability to hit targets with his web-shooters and face off against the Vulture. It was also available at select Cinemark Theatres in the United States and at the CineEurope trade show in Barcelona.[224]\n\n\nAhead of the film's release, for the week ending on July 2, the film was the top film for the third consecutive week for new social media conversations, according to comScore, which also noted that *Spider-Man: Homecoming* had produced a total of 2.67 million conversations to date.[225] Other promotions included Audi and Dell (both also had product placement in the film), Pizza Hut, General Mills, Synchrony Bank, Movietickets.com, Goodwill, Baskin Robbins, Dunkin' Donuts, Danone Waters, Panasonic Batteries, M&M's, Mondelez, Asus, Bimbo, Jetstar, KEF, Kellogg's, Lieferheld, PepsiCo, Plus, Roady, Snickers, Sony Mobile, Oppo, Optus, and Doritos. Watts directed a commercial for Dell's marketing efforts as well, which earned 2.8 million views online. Goodwill hosted a build-your-own Spider-Man suit contest, with the winner attending the film's premiere. Overall, the campaign generated over $140 million in media value, greater than those for all previous Spider-Man films and Marvel Studios' first 2017 release, *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2*. This does not include merchandising for the film, which is controlled by Marvel and Disney.[226] Marketing of the film in China included partnering with Momo, iQiyi, Tencent QQ, Baidu, Mizone, CapitaLand, Xiaomi, HTC, and corporate parent Sony.[227][228] To help target the teenage audience, Holland \"recorded a high school entrance exam greeting\" while *The Rap of China* contestant PG One recorded a theme song.[227]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The world premiere of *Spider-Man: Homecoming* at TCL Chinese Theatre\n*Spider-Man: Homecoming* held its world premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 28, 2017,[229] and was released in the United Kingdom on July 5.[230] It opened in additional international markets on July 6,[231] with 23,400 screens (277 of which were IMAX) in 56 markets for its opening weekend.[232] The film was released in the United States on July 7,[134] in 4,348 theaters (392 were IMAX and IMAX 3D, and 601 were premium large-format),[10][135][233] including 3D screenings.[10] It was originally slated for release on July 28.[134] *Spider-Man: Homecoming* is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[234]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Spider-Man: Homecoming* was released on digital download by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on September 26, 2017, and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, Ultra HD Blu-ray, and DVD on October 17, 2017. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[235] The physical releases in its first week of sale were the top home media release, according to NPD VideoScan data. The Blu-ray version accounted for 79% of the sales, with 13% of total sales coming from the Ultra HD Blu-ray version.[236]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Sony signed a deal with Disney giving them access to their legacy content, including past Spider-Man films and Marvel content in Sony's Spider-Man Universe, to stream on Disney+ and Hulu and appear on Disney's linear television networks. Disney's access to Sony's titles would come following their availability on Netflix. *Homecoming* had previously been available on Starz and FX.[237][238] The film became available on Disney+ in the United Kingdom and Australia on June 17, 2022,[239][240] and became available in the United States on May 12, 2023.[241]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Spider-Man: Homecoming* grossed over $334.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $546 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $880.2 million.[3] The film had the second-biggest global IMAX opening for a Sony film with $18 million.[232] In May 2017, a survey from Fandango indicated that *Homecoming* was the second-most-anticipated summer blockbuster behind *Wonder Woman*.[242] By September 24, 2017, the film had earned $874.4 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing superhero film of 2017, and the sixth-largest film based on a Marvel character.[243] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as $200.1 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it seventh on their list of 2017's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[244]\n\n\nThe film earned $50.9 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada (including $15.4 million from Thursday night previews),[103] and had a total weekend gross of $117 million, the top film for the weekend.[245] It was the second-highest opening for both a Spider-Man film and a Sony film, after *Spider-Man 3*'s $151.1 million debut in 2007.[103] Early projections for the film from *BoxOffice* had it earning $135 million in its opening weekend,[246] which was later adjusted to $125 million,[247] and *Deadline Hollywood* noting industry projections at anywhere between $90–120 million.[233] In its second weekend, the film fell to second behind *War for the Planet of the Apes* with $44.2 million, a 62% decline in earnings, which was similar to the declines *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* and *Spider-Man 3* had in their second weekends. Additionally, *Homecoming*'s domestic gross reached $208.3 million, which surpassed the total domestic gross of *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* ($202.9 million).[248] The film fell to third in its third weekend.[249] By July 26, *Homecoming*'s domestic gross reached $262.1 million, surpassing the total domestic gross of *The Amazing Spider-Man* ($262 million),[250] leading to a fifth-place finish for its fourth weekend.[251] The next weekend, *Homecoming* finished sixth,[252] and finished seventh the following five weekends.[253][254][255][256][257] By September 3, 2017, the film had earned $325.1 million,[256] surpassing the $325 million projected amount for its total domestic gross.[246] In its eleventh weekend, *Homecoming* finished ninth.[258]\n\n\nOutside of the United States and Canada, *Spider-Man: Homecoming* earned $140.5 million its opening weekend from the 56 markets it opened in, with the film becoming number one in 50 of them. The $140.5 million was the highest opening ever for a Spider-Man film.[232] South Korea had the highest Wednesday opening day gross,[259] which contributed to a $25.4 million five-day opening in the country, the third-highest opening ever for a Hollywood film.[232] Brazil had the largest July opening day of all time, with $2 million,[259] leading to an opening weekend total of $8.9 million. The $7 million earned from IMAX showings was the top opening of all time for a Sony film internationally.[232] In its second weekend, the film opened in France at number one and number two in Germany. It earned an additional $11.9 million in South Korea, to bring its total in the country to $42.2 million. This made *Homecoming* the highest-grossing Spider-Man film and the top-grossing Hollywood film of 2017 in the country. Brazil contributed an additional $5.7 million, for a total of $19.4 million from the country, which was also the largest gross from a Spider-Man film.[260] The film's third weekend saw the Latin America region set a record as the highest-grossing Spider-Man film of all time, with a region total of $77.4 million. Brazil remained the top-grossing market for the region, with $25.7 million. In South Korea, the film became the 10th-highest-grossing international release of all time.[261] *Homecoming* opened at number one in Spain in its fourth weekend.[262] In its sixth weekend, the film opened at number one in Japan, with its $770,000 from IMAX the fourth-largest IMAX weekend for a Marvel film in the country.[263] The film opened at number one in China on September 8, 2017, grossing $23 million on its opening day, including Thursday previews, making it the third biggest opening day for a Marvel Cinematic Universe film, behind *Avengers: Age of Ultron* and *Captain America: Civil War*, and the largest opening day gross for a Sony film in the country.[227] The $70.8 million *Homecoming* earned in China for its opening weekend was the third-highest opening behind *Age of Ultron* and *Civil War*, with $6 million from IMAX, which was the best IMAX opening weekend in September, and the best IMAX opening weekend for a Sony film.[228] As of September 24, 2017[update], the film's largest markets were China ($115.7 million),[243] South Korea ($51.4 million), and the United Kingdom ($34.8 million).[264]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tom Holland's performance as Spider-Man received praise.\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 92%, with an average score of 7.6/10, based on 400 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"*Spider-Man: Homecoming* does whatever a second reboot can, delivering a colorful, fun adventure that fits snugly in the sprawling MCU without getting bogged down in franchise-building.\"[265] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[266] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 89% overall positive score and a 74% \"definite recommend\".[103]\n\n\nSara Stewart of the *New York Post* praised the film as \"an endearingly awkward kid brother to the glamorous *Wonder Woman*\", attributing much of the \"heavy-lifting\" to Holland's performance and the \"perfectly cast\" Keaton. She also noted Watts' focus on Parker's human side.[267] Mike Ryan at *Uproxx* felt *Homecoming* was the best *Spider-Man* film yet, specifically praising the light tone, younger and more optimistic portrayal of Parker, and Keaton's performance—Ryan named the Vulture twist reveal as one of his favorite scenes in the MCU. He said *Homecoming* is \"the kind of movie you leave and you're just in the best mood—and still will be days later.\"[268] Richard Roeper of the *Chicago Sun-Times* called the film unique and refreshing, praising its lower stakes and focus on the character's school life. He praised Holland as \"terrific and well-cast\", as well as the other cast members; Roeper believed that Keaton's performance is more interesting than the character otherwise could have been.[269] Owen Gleiberman of *Variety* felt the film was \"just distinctive enough\" from the previous *Spider-Man* films to become a \"sizable hit\", and highlighted its focus on making Peter Parker a realistically youthful and grounded character. He found Holland to be likable in the role and thought the Vulture twist was a positive direction for that character. He did criticize the vague take on Spider-Man's origin and powers, but \"the flying action has a casual flip buoyancy, and the movie does get you rooting for Peter.\"[1] At IndieWire, David Ehrlich criticized the film's superhero genre clichés and underwritten female characters, but praised the elements of the film that leaned into Parker's high school life and the humanity of the Vulture.[270]\n\n\nKenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* gave the film a mixed review, criticizing the \"juvenile\" depiction of Parker and Watts' \"unevenly orchestrated\" direction, but feeling that the film \"finds its pace and rhythm by the end\" and praising Keaton's performance.[271] *The Hollywood Reporter*'s John DeFore found the film to be \"occasionally exciting but often frustrating\", and suggested it might have worked better if less focus had been put on integrating the film with the MCU. DeFore did praise Holland's performance as \"winning\" despite the script, and called Zendaya a scene-stealer.[272] Mick LaSalle, writing for the *San Francisco Chronicle*, said the film was a \"pretty good Spider-Man movie\" that \"breaks no new ground\", not exploring the human side of the character enough and instead focusing on action that is not thrilling.[273] At *The Telegraph*, Robbie Collin argued that \"a little of the new Spider-Man went an exhilaratingly long way in *Captain America: Civil War* last year. But a lot of him goes almost nowhere in this slack and spiritless solo escapade.\" Collin criticized Watts' direction but was positive of the cast, including Holland, Keaton, Tomei, and Zendaya.[274]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\n | Teen Choice Awards | Choice Breakout Movie Star\n | Tom Holland | Nominated\n | [275] |\n| Zendaya | Nominated\n |\n| Choice Summer Movie\n | *Spider-Man: Homecoming* | Won\n |\n| Choice Summer Movie Actor\n | Tom Holland | Won\n |\n| Choice Summer Movie Actress\n | Zendaya | Won\n |\n| Washington D.C.

Being in the mainstream continuity of the franchise, it was the character's first title, launching seven months after his introduction in the final issue of *Amazing Fantasy*. The series began publication with a March 1963 cover date and has been published nearly continuously to date over six volumes with only one significant interruption. Issues of the title currently feature an issue number within its sixth volume, as well as a \"legacy\" number reflecting the issue's overall number across all *Amazing Spider-Man* volumes. The title reached 900 issues in 2022.\n\n\nThe series began as a bimonthly periodical before being increased to monthly after four issues. It was the character's sole monthly headlining title until *Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man* launched in 1976. After 441 issues, *The Amazing Spider-Man* was restarted in 1999 as issue No. 1 of Volume 2. It ran for 58 issues before reverting to the title's overall issue number with #500 in 2003. The series ran essentially continuously over the first two volumes from 1963 until its landmark 700th issue at the end of 2012 when it was replaced by *The Superior Spider-Man* as part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch of Marvel's comic lines.[1] The title was occasionally published biweekly during the first two volumes, and was published three times a month from 2008 to 2010. After the relaunch of *Action Comics* and *Detective Comics* in 2011, *The Amazing Spider-Man* briefly became the highest-numbered active American comic book.\n\n\n*The Amazing Spider-Man* returned with volume 3 in April 2014 following the conclusion of *The Superior Spider-Man* story arc after 18 issues. In late 2015, the series was relaunched with a fourth volume following the 2015 *Secret Wars* event. After 32 issues, the volume was once again relaunched as part of *Marvel Legacy*, returning to the overall \"legacy\" numbering with issue No. 789 in late 2017. Less than a year later, the series was relaunched again with a fifth volume as part of Marvel's *Fresh Start*. For the first time, although the issue numbers were again restarted from #1, the issues also bore the overall \"legacy\" issue number. A sixth volume commenced in April 2022 to celebrate Spider-Man's 60th anniversary. Since the third volume, the title has had various release schedules, including monthly and bi-weekly, among others.\n\n\n\n\n## Publication history[edit]\n\n\nWriter-editor Stan Lee and artist and co-plotter Steve Ditko created the character of Spider-Man,[2] and the pair produced 38 issues from March 1963 to July 1966. Ditko left after the 38th issue, while Lee remained as writer until issue 100. Since then, many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic through the years, chronicling the adventures of Marvel's most identifiable hero.\n\n\n*The Amazing Spider-Man* has been the character's flagship series for his first fifty years in publication, and was the only monthly series to star Spider-Man until *Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man*, in 1976, although 1972 saw the debut of *Marvel Team-Up*, with the vast majority of issues featuring Spider-Man along with a rotating cast of other Marvel characters. Most of the major characters and villains of the Spider-Man saga have been introduced in *Amazing*, and with few exceptions, it is where most key events in the character's history have occurred. The title was published continuously until No. 441 (Nov. 1998)[3] when Marvel Comics relaunched it as vol. 2 No. 1 (Jan. 1999),[4] but on Spider-Man's 40th anniversary, this new title reverted to using the numbering of the original series, beginning again with issue No. 500 (Dec. 2003) and lasting until the final issue, No. 700 (Feb. 2013).[5]\n\n\n\n### 1960s[edit]\n\n\nDue to strong sales on the character's first appearance in *Amazing Fantasy* No. 15, Spider-Man was given his own ongoing series in March 1963.[6] The initial years of the series, under Lee and Ditko, chronicled Spider-Man's nascent career as a masked super-human vigilante with his civilian life as hard-luck yet perpetually good-humored and well-meaning teenager Peter Parker. Peter balanced his career as Spider-Man with his job as a freelance photographer for *The Daily Bugle* under the bombastic editor-publisher J. Jonah Jameson to support himself and his frail Aunt May. At the same time, Peter dealt with public hostility towards Spider-Man and the antagonism of his classmates Flash Thompson and Liz Allan at Midtown High School, while embarking on a tentative, ill-fated romance with Jameson's secretary, Betty Brant.\n\n\nBy focusing on Parker's everyday problems, Lee and Ditko created a groundbreakingly flawed, self-doubting superhero, and the first major teenaged superhero to be a protagonist and not a sidekick. Ditko's quirky art provided a stark contrast to the more cleanly dynamic stylings of Marvel's most prominent artist, Jack Kirby,[2] and combined with the humor and pathos of Lee's writing to lay the foundation for what became an enduring mythos.\n\n\nMost of Spider-Man's key villains and supporting characters were introduced during this time. Issue No. 1 (Mar. 1963) featured the first appearances of J. Jonah Jameson[7] and his astronaut son John Jameson,[8] and the supervillain the Chameleon.[7] It included the hero's first encounter with the superhero team the Fantastic Four. Issue No. 2 (May 1963) featured the first appearance of the Vulture[9] and the Tinkerer[10] as well as the beginning of Parker's freelance photography career at the newspaper *The Daily Bugle*.[11]\n\n\nThe Lee-Ditko era continued to usher in a significant number of villains and supporting characters, including Doctor Octopus in No. 3 (July 1963);[12][13] the Sandman and Betty Brant in No. 4 (Sept. 1963);[14] the Lizard in No. 6 (Nov. 1963);[15][16] Living Brain in No. 8 (Jan. 1964); Electro in No. 9 (Mar. 1964);[17][18] Mysterio in No. 13 (June 1964);[19] the Green Goblin in No. 14 (July 1964);[20][21] Kraven The Hunter in No. 15 (Aug. 1964);[22] reporter Ned Leeds in No. 18 (Nov. 1964);[23] and the Scorpion in No. 20 (Jan. 1965).[24] The Molten Man was introduced in No. 28 (Sept. 1965) which also featured Parker's graduation from high school.[25] Peter began attending Empire State University in No. 31 (Dec. 1965), which featured the first appearances of friends and classmates Gwen Stacy[26] and Harry Osborn.[27] Harry's father, Norman Osborn first appeared in No. 23 (April 1965) as a member of Jameson's country club but was not named nor revealed as Harry's father until No. 37 (June 1966).\n\n\nOne of the most celebrated issues of the Lee-Ditko run is No. 33 (Feb. 1966), the third part of the story arc \"If This Be My Destiny...!\", which features the dramatic scene of Spider-Man, through force of will and thoughts of family, escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that \"Steve Ditko squeezes every ounce of anguish out of Spider-Man's predicament, complete with visions of the uncle he failed and the aunt he has sworn to save.\"[28] Peter David observed that \"After his origin, this two-page sequence from *Amazing Spider-Man* No. 33 is perhaps the best-loved sequence from the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko era.\"[29] Steve Saffel stated the \"full page Ditko image from *The Amazing Spider-Man* No. 33 is one of the most powerful ever to appear in the series and influenced writers and artists for many years to come.\"[30] and Matthew K. Manning wrote that \"Ditko's illustrations for the first few pages of this Lee story included what would become one of the most iconic scenes in Spider-Man's history.\"[31] The story was chosen as No. 15 in the 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time poll of Marvel's readers in 2001. Editor Robert Greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story that \"These first five pages are a modern-day equivalent to Shakespeare as Parker's soliloquy sets the stage for his next action. And with dramatic pacing and storytelling, Ditko delivers one of the great sequences in all comics.\"[32]\n\n\nAlthough credited only as artist for most of his run, Ditko would eventually plot the stories as well as draw them, leaving Lee to script the dialogue. A rift between Ditko and Lee developed, and the two men were not on speaking terms long before Ditko completed his last issue, *The Amazing Spider-Man* No. 38 (July 1966). The exact reasons for the Ditko-Lee split have never been fully explained.[33] Spider-Man successor artist John Romita Sr., in a 2010 deposition, recalled that Lee and Ditko \"ended up not being able to work together because they disagreed on almost everything, cultural, social, historically, everything, they disagreed on characters...\"[34]\n\n\nIn successor penciler Romita Sr.'s first issue, No. 39 (Aug. 1966), nemesis the Green Goblin discovers Spider-Man's secret identity and reveals his own to the captive hero. Romita's Spider-Man – more polished and heroic-looking than Ditko's – became the model for two decades. The Lee-Romita era saw the introduction of such characters as *Daily Bugle* managing editor Robbie Robertson in No. 52 (Sept. 1967) and NYPD Captain George Stacy, father of Parker's girlfriend Gwen Stacy, in No. 56 (Jan. 1968). The most important supporting character to be introduced during the Romita era was Mary Jane Watson, who made her first full appearance in No. 42 (Nov. 1966),[35] although she first appeared in No. 25 (June 1965) with her face obscured and had been mentioned since No. 15 (Aug. 1964). Peter David wrote in 2010 that Romita \"made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling Mary Jane out from behind the oversized potted plant [that blocked the reader's view of her face in issue no. 25] and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment.\"[36] Romita has stated that in designing Mary Jane, he \"used Ann-Margret from the movie *Bye Bye Birdie* as a guide, using her coloring, the shape of her face, her red hair and her form-fitting short skirts.\"[37]\n\n\nLee and Romita toned down the prevalent sense of antagonism in Parker's world by improving Parker's relationship with the supporting characters and having stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man's adventures. The stories became more topical,[38] addressing issues such as civil rights, racism, prisoners' rights, the Vietnam War, and political elections.\n\n\nIssue No. 50 (June 1967) introduced the highly enduring criminal mastermind the Kingpin,[39][40] who would become a major force as well in the superhero series *Daredevil*. Other notable first appearances in the Lee-Romita era include the Rhino in No. 41 (Oct. 1966),[41][42] the Shocker in No. 46 (Mar. 1967),[43][44] the Prowler in No. 78 (Nov. 1969),[45] and the Kingpin's son, Richard Fisk, in No. 83 (Apr. 1970).[46]\n\n\n\n### 1970s[edit]\n\n\nSeveral spin-off series debuted in the 1970s: *Marvel Team-Up* in 1972,[47] and *The Spectacular Spider-Man* in 1976.[48] A short-lived series titled *Giant-Size Spider-Man* began in July 1974 and ran six issues through 1975.[49] *Spidey Super Stories*, a series aimed at children ages 6–10, ran for 57 issues from October 1974 through 1982.[50][51]\nThe flagship title's second decade took a grim turn with a story in #89-90 (Oct.-Nov. 1970) featuring the death of Captain George Stacy.[52] This was the first Spider-Man story to be penciled by Gil Kane,[53] who would alternate drawing duties with Romita for the next year-and-a-half and would draw several landmark issues.\n\n\nOne such story took place in the controversial issues #96–98 (May–July 1971). Writer-editor Lee defied the Comics Code Authority with this story, in which Parker's friend Harry Osborn, was hospitalized after over-dosing on pills. Lee wrote this story upon a request from the U. S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare for a story about the dangers of drugs. Citing its dictum against depicting drug use, even in an anti-drug context, the CCA refused to put its seal on these issues. With the approval of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman, Lee had the comics published without the seal. The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts.[54] The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs, among other new freedoms.[55]\n\n\n\"The Six Arms Saga\" of #100–102 (Sept.–Nov. 1971) introduced Morbius, the Living Vampire. The second installment was the first *Amazing Spider-Man* story not written by co-creator Lee,[56] with Roy Thomas taking over writing the book for several months before Lee returned to write #105–110 (Feb.-July 1972).[57] Lee, who was going on to become Marvel Comics' publisher, with Thomas becoming editor-in-chief, then turned writing duties over to 19-year-old Gerry Conway,[58] who scripted the series through 1975. Romita penciled Conway's first half-dozen issues, which introduced the gangster Hammerhead in No. 113 (Oct. 1972). Kane then succeeded Romita as penciler,[53] although Romita would continue inking Kane for a time.\n\n\nIssue 121 (June 1973 by Conway-Kane-Romita) featured the death of Gwen Stacy at the hands of the Green Goblin in \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died.\"[59][60][61] Her demise and the Goblin's apparent death one issue later formed a story arc widely considered as the most defining in the history of Spider-Man.[62] The aftermath of the story deepened both the characterization of Mary Jane Watson and her relationship with Parker.\n\n\nIn 1973 Gil Kane was succeeded by Ross Andru, whose run lasted from issue #125 (Oct. 1973) to #185 (Oct. 1978).[63] Issue#129 (Feb. 1974) introduced the Punisher,[64] who would become one of Marvel Comics' most popular characters. The Conway-Andru era featured the first appearances of the Man-Wolf in #124–125 (Sept.-Oct. 1973); the near-marriage of Doctor Octopus and Aunt May in #131 (Apr. 1974); Harry Osborn stepping into his father's role as the Green Goblin in #135–137 (Aug.-Oct.1974); and the original \"Clone Saga\", containing the introduction of Spider-Man's clone, in #147–149 (Aug.-Oct. 1975).\n\n\nArchie Goodwin and Gil Kane produced the title's 150th issue (Nov. 1975) before Len Wein became writer with issue No. 151.[65] During Wein's tenure, Harry Osborn and Liz Allen dated and became engaged; J. Jonah Jameson was introduced to his eventual second wife, Marla Madison; and Aunt May suffered a heart attack. Wein's last story on *Amazing* was a five-issue arc in #176–180 (Jan.-May 1978) featuring a third Green Goblin (Harry Osborn's psychiatrist, Bart Hamilton).\n\n\nMarv Wolfman, Marvel's editor-in-chief from 1975 to 1976, succeeded Wein as writer and, in his first issue, #182 (July 1978), had Parker propose marriage to Watson, who refused in the following issue.[66] Keith Pollard succeeded Andru as artist shortly afterward and, with Wolfman, introduced the likable rogue the Black Cat (Felicia Hardy) in #194 (July 1979).[67] As a love interest for Spider-Man, the Black Cat would go on to be an important supporting character for the better part of the next decade and remain a friend and occasional lover into the 2010s.\n\n\n\n### 1980s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*The Amazing Spider-Man* No. 252 (May 1984): Spider-Man's black costume debuts. Cover art by Ron Frenz and Klaus Janson.\n*The Amazing Spider-Man* #200 (Jan. 1980) featured the return and death of the burglar who killed Spider-Man's Uncle Ben.[68] Writer Marv Wolfman and penciler Keith Pollard both left the title by mid-year, succeeded by Dennis O'Neil, a writer known for groundbreaking 1970s work at rival DC Comics,[69] and penciler John Romita Jr. O'Neil wrote two issues of *The Amazing Spider-Man Annual* which were both drawn by Frank Miller. The 1980 *Annual* featured a team-up with Doctor Strange[70] while the 1981 *Annual* showcased a meeting with the Punisher.[71] Roger Stern, who had written nearly 20 issues of sister title *The Spectacular Spider-Man*, took over *Amazing* with #224 (Jan. 1982).[72] During his two years on the title, Stern augmented the backgrounds of long-established Spider-Man villains and, with Romita Jr., created the mysterious supervillain the Hobgoblin in #238–239 (Mar.–Apr. 1983).[73][74] Fans engaged with the mystery of the Hobgoblin's secret identity, which continued throughout #244–245 and 249–251 (Sept.-Oct. 1983 and Feb.-April 1984). One lasting change was the reintroduction of Mary Jane Watson as a more serious, mature woman who becomes Peter's confidante after she reveals that she knows his secret identity. Stern also wrote \"The Kid Who Collects Spider-Man\" in *The Amazing Spider-Man* #248 (Jan. 1984), a story which ranks among his most popular.[73][75]\n\n\nBy mid-1984, Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz took over scripting and penciling. DeFalco helped establish Parker and Watson's mature relationship, laying the foundation for the characters' wedding in 1987. Notably, in #257 (Oct. 1984), Watson tells Parker that she knows he is Spider-Man, and in #259 (Dec. 1984), she reveals to Parker the extent of her troubled childhood. Other notable issues of the DeFalco-Frenz era include #252 (May 1984), the first appearance of Spider-Man's black costume, which the hero would wear almost exclusively for the next four years' worth of comics; the debut of criminal mastermind the Rose in #253 (June 1984); the revelation in #258 (Nov. 1984) that the black costume is a living being, a symbiote; and the introduction of the female mercenary Silver Sable in #265 (June 1985).\n\n\nDeFalco and Frenz were both removed from *The Amazing Spider-Man* in 1986 by editor Jim Owsley under acrimonious circumstances.[76] A succession of artists including Alan Kupperberg, John Romita Jr., and Alex Saviuk penciled the series from 1987 to 1988, and Owsley wrote the book for the first half of 1987, scripting the five-part \"Gang War\" story (#284–288) that DeFalco plotted. Former *Spectacular Spider-Man* writer Peter David scripted #289 (June 1987), which revealed Ned Leeds as being the Hobgoblin although this was retconned in 1996 by Roger Stern into Leeds not being the original Hobgoblin after all.\n\n\nDavid Michelinie took over as writer in the next issue, for a story arc in #290–292 (July–Sept. 1987) that led to the marriage of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson in *Amazing Spider-Man Annual* No. 21. The \"Kraven's Last Hunt\" storyline by writer J.M. DeMatteis and artists Mike Zeck and Bob McLeod crossed over into *The Amazing Spider-Man* #293 and 294.[77] Issue No.298 (Mar. 1988) was the first Spider-Man comic to be drawn by future industry star Todd McFarlane, the first regular artist on *The Amazing Spider-Man* since Frenz's departure. McFarlane revolutionized Spider-Man's look. His depiction – \"Ditko-esque\" poses,[78] large eyes; wiry, contorted limbs; and messy, knotted, convoluted webbing – influenced the way virtually all subsequent artists would draw the character. McFarlane's other significant contribution to the Spider-Man canon was the design for what would become one of Spider-Man's most wildly popular antagonists, the supervillain Venom.[79] Issue No. 299 (Apr. 1988) featured Venom's first appearance (a last-page cameo) before his first full appearance in #300 (May 1988). The latter issue featured Spider-Man reverting to his original red-and-blue costume.\n\n\nOther notable issues of the Michelinie-McFarlane era include #312 (Feb. 1989), featuring the Green Goblin vs. the Hobgoblin; and #315–317 (May–July 1989), with the return of Venom. In July 2012, Todd McFarlane's original cover art for *The Amazing Spider-Man* No. 328 sold for a bid of $657,250, making it the most expensive American comic book art ever sold at auction.[80]\n\n\n\n### 1990s[edit]\n\n\nWith a civilian life as a married man, the Spider-Man of the 1990s was different from the superhero of the previous three decades. McFarlane left the title in 1990 to write and draw a new series titled simply *Spider-Man*. His successor, Erik Larsen, penciled the book from early 1990 to mid-1991. After issue No. 350, Larsen was succeeded by Mark Bagley, who had won the 1986 Marvel Tryout Contest[81] and was assigned a number of low-profile penciling jobs followed by a run on *New Warriors* in 1990. Bagley penciled the flagship Spider-Man title from 1991 to 1996.[82] During that time, Bagley's rendition of Spider-Man was used extensively for licensed material and merchandise.\n\n\nIssues #361–363 (April–June 1992) introduced Carnage,[83] a second symbiote nemesis for Spider-Man. The series' 30th-anniversary issue, No. 365 (Aug. 1992), was a double-sized, hologram-cover issue[84] with the cliffhanger ending of Peter Parker's parents, long thought dead, reappearing alive. It would be close to two years before they were revealed to be impostors, who are killed in No. 388 (April 1994), scripter Michelinie's last issue. His 1987–1994 stint gave him the second-longest run as writer on the title, behind Stan Lee.\n\n\nIssue No. 375 was released with a gold foil cover.[85] There was an error affecting some issues and which are missing the majority of the foil.[86]\n\n\nWith No. 389, writer J. M. DeMatteis, whose Spider-Man credits included the 1987 \"Kraven's Last Hunt\" story arc and a 1991–1993 run on *The Spectacular Spider-Man*, took over the title. From October 1994 to June 1996, *Amazing* stopped running stories exclusive to it, and ran installments of multi-part stories that crossed over into all the Spider-Man books. One of the few self-contained stories during this period was in No. 400 (April 1995), which featured the death of Aunt May – later revealed to have been faked (although the death still stands in the MC2 continuity). The \"Clone Saga\" culminated with the revelation that the Spider-Man who had appeared in the previous 20 years of comics was a clone of the real Spider-Man. This plot twist was massively unpopular with many readers,[87] and was later reversed in the \"Revelations\" story arc that crossed over the Spider-Man books in late 1996.\n\n\nThe Clone Saga tied into a publishing gap after No. 406 (Oct. 1995), when the title was temporarily replaced by *The Amazing Scarlet Spider* #1–2 (Nov.-Dec. 1995), featuring Ben Reilly. The series picked up again with No. 407 (Jan. 1996), with Tom DeFalco returning as writer. Bagley completed his 5½-year run by September 1996. A succession of artists, including Ron Garney, Steve Skroce, Joe Bennett, Rafael Kayanan and John Byrne penciled the book until the final issue, No. 441 (Nov. 1998), after which Marvel rebooted the title with vol. 2, No. 1 (Jan. 1999).\n\n\n\n### Relaunch and the 2000s[edit]\n\n\nMarvel began *The Amazing Spider-Man* relaunching the 'Amazing' comic book series with (vol. 2) #1 (Jan. 1999).[88][89] Howard Mackie wrote the first 29 issues. The relaunch included the Sandman being regressed to his criminal ways and the \"death\" of Mary Jane, which was ultimately reversed. Other elements included the introduction of a new Spider-Woman (who was spun off into her own short-lived series) and references to John Byrne's miniseries *Spider-Man: Chapter One*, which was launched at the same time as the reboot. Byrne also penciled issues #1–18 (from 1999 to 2000) and wrote #13–14, John Romita Jr. took his place soon after in October 2000. Mackie's run ended with *The Amazing Spider-Man Annual 2001*, which saw the return of Mary Jane, who then left Parker upon reuniting with him.\n\n\nWith issue No. 30 (June 2001), J. Michael Straczynski took over as writer[90] and oversaw additional storylines – most notably his lengthy \"Spider-Totem\" arc, which raised the issue of whether Spider-Man's powers were magic-based, rather than as the result of a radioactive spider's bite. Additionally, Straczynski resurrected the plot point of Aunt May discovering her nephew was Spider-Man,[91] and returned Mary Jane, with the couple reuniting in *The Amazing Spider-Man* (vol. 2) #50. Straczynski gave Spider-Man a new profession, having Parker teach at his former high school.\n\n\nIssue No. 30 began a dual numbering system, with the original series numbering (#471) returned and placed alongside the volume two number on the cover. Other longtime, rebooted Marvel Comics titles, including *Fantastic Four*, likewise were given the dual numbering around this time. After (vol. 2) #58 (Nov. 2003), the title reverted completely to its original numbering for issue No. 500 (Dec. 2003).[88] Mike Deodato, Jr. penciled the series from mid-2004 until 2006.\n\n\nThat year Peter Parker revealed his Spider-Man identity on live television in the company-crossover storyline \"Civil War\",[92][93] in which the superhero community is split over whether to conform to the federal government's new Superhuman Registration Act. This knowledge was erased from the world with the event of the four-part, crossover story arc, \"One More Day\", written partially by J. Michael Straczynski and illustrated by Joe Quesada, running through *The Amazing Spider-Man* #544–545 (Nov.-Dec. 2007), *Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man* No. 24 (Nov. 2007) and *The Sensational Spider-Man* No. 41 (Dec. 2007), the final issues of those two titles. Here, the demon Mephisto makes a Faustian bargain with Parker and Mary Jane, offering to save Parker's dying Aunt May if the couple will allow their marriage to have never existed, rewriting that portion of their pasts. This story arc marked the end of Straczynski's work on the title.\n\n\nFollowing this, Marvel made *The Amazing Spider-Man* the company's sole Spider-Man title, increasing its frequency of publication to three issues monthly, and inaugurating the series with a sequence of \"back to basics\" story arcs under the banner of \"Brand New Day\". Parker now exists in a changed world where he and Mary Jane had never married, and Parker has no memory of being married to her, with domino effect differences in their immediate world. The most notable of these revisions to Spider-Man continuity are the return of Harry Osborn, whose death in *The Spectacular Spider-Man* No. 200 (May 1993) is erased; and the reestablishment of Spider-Man's secret identity, with no one except Mary Jane able to recall that Parker is Spider-Man (although he soon reveals his secret identity to the New Avengers and the Fantastic Four). Under the banner of *Brand New Day*, Marvel tried to only use newly created villains instead of relying on older ones. Characters like Mister Negative and Overdrive both in Free Comic Book Day 2007 Spider-Man (July 2007), Menace in No. 549 (March 2008), Ana and Sasha Kravinoff in No. 565 (September 2008) and No. 567 (October 2008) respectively, and several more were introduced. The alternating regular writers were initially Dan Slott, Bob Gale, Marc Guggenheim, and Zeb Wells, joined by a rotation of artists that included Steve McNiven, Salvador Larroca, Phil Jimenez, Barry Kitson, Chris Bachalo, Mike McKone, Marcos Martín, and John Romita Jr. Joe Kelly, Mark Waid, Fred Van Lente and Roger Stern later joined the writing team and Paolo Rivera, Lee Weeks and Marco Checchetto the artist roster. Waid's work on the series included a meeting between Spider-Man and Stephen Colbert in *The Amazing Spider-Man* No. 573 (Dec. 2008).[94]\nIssue No. 583 (March 2009) included a back-up story in which Spider-Man meets President Barack Obama.[95][96]\n\n\n\n### 2010s and temporary end of publication[edit]\n\n\nMark Waid scripted the opening of \"The Gauntlet\" storyline in issue No. 612 (Jan. 2010).[97] The *Gauntlet* story was concluded by *Grim Hunt* (No. 634-637) which saw the resurrection of long-dead Spider-Man villain, Kraven the Hunter. The series became a twice-monthly title with Dan Slott as sole writer at issue No. 648 (Jan. 2011), launching the *Big Time* storyline.[98][99] Eight additional pages were added per issue. *Big Time* saw major changes in Spider-Man/Peter Parker's life, Peter would start working at Horizon Labs and begin a relationship with Carlie Cooper (his first serious relationship since his marriage to Mary Jane), Mac Gargan returned as Scorpion after spending the past few years as Venom, Phil Urich would take up the mantle of Hobgoblin, and the death of J. Jonah Jameson's wife, Marla Jameson. Issues 654 and 654.1 saw the birth of Agent Venom, Flash Thompson bonded with the Venom symbiote, which would lead to Venom getting his own series *Venom (volume 2)*. Starting in No. 659 and going to No. 665, the series built-up to the *Spider-Island* event which officially started in No. 666 and ended in No. 673. *Ends of the Earth* was the next event that ran from No. 682 through No. 687. This publishing format lasted until issue No. 700, which concluded the \"Dying Wish\" storyline, in which Parker and Doctor Octopus swapped bodies, and the latter taking on the mantle of Spider-Man when Parker apparently died in Doctor Octopus' body. *The Amazing Spider-Man* ended with this issue, with the story continuing in the new series *The Superior Spider-Man*.[100][101] Despite *The Superior Spider-Man* being considered a different series to *The Amazing Spider-Man*, the first 33 issue run goes towards the legacy numbering of *The Amazing Spider-Man* acting as issues 701–733. In December 2013, the series returned for five issues, numbered 700.1 through 700.5, with the first two written by David Morrell and drawn by Klaus Janson.[102]\n\n\n\n### 2014 relaunch[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2014, Marvel confirmed that *The Amazing Spider-Man* would be relaunched on April 30, 2014, starting from issue No. 1, with Peter Parker as Spider-Man once again.[103]\nThe first issue of this new version of *The Amazing Spider-Man* was, according to Diamond Comics Distributors, the \"best-selling comic book... in over a decade.\"[104]\nIssues #1–6 were a story arc called \"Lucky to be Alive\", taking place immediately after \"Goblin Nation\", with issues No. 4 and No. 5 being a crossover with the *Original Sin* storyline. Issue No. 4 introduced Silk, a new heroine who was bitten by the same spider as Peter Parker. Issues #7–8 featured a team-up between Ms. Marvel and Spider-Man, and had backup stories that tied into \"Edge of Spider-Verse\". The next major plot arc, titled \"Spider-Verse\", began in Issue No. 9 and ended in No. 15, features every Spider-Man from across the dimensions being hunted by Morlun, and a team-up to stop him, with Peter Parker of Earth-616 in command of the Spider-Men's Alliance. *The Amazing Spider-Man Annual* No. 1 of the relaunched series was released in December 2014, featuring stories unrelated to \"Spider-Verse\".\n\n\n\n### The Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, Marvel started the universe wide Secret Wars event where the core and several other Marvel universes were combined into one big planet called Battleworld. Battleworld was divided into sections with most of them being self-contained universes. Marvel announced that several of these self-contained universes would get their own tie in series and one of them was *Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows*, an alternate universe where Peter Parker and Mary Jane are still married and give birth to their child Annie May Parker, written by Dan Slott. Despite the series being considered separate from the main *Amazing Spider-Man* series, the original 5 issue run is counted towards its legacy numbering acting as No. 752-756.\n\n\n\n### 2015 relaunch[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the 2015 *Secret Wars* event, a number of Spider-Man-related titles were either relaunched or created as part of the \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\" event. Among them, *The Amazing Spider-Man* was relaunched as well and primarily focused on Peter Parker continuing to run Parker Industries and becoming a successful businessman operating worldwide.[105] It also tied with *Civil War II* (involving an Inhuman named Ulysses Cain who can predict possible futures), *Dead No More* (where Ben Reilly [the original Scarlet Spider] revealed to be revived and as one of the antagonists instead), and *Secret Empire* (during Hydra's reign led by a Hydra influenced Captain America/Steve Rogers, and the dismissal of Parker Industries by Peter Parker to stop Otto Octavius). Starting in September 2017, Marvel started the Marvel Legacy event which renumbered several Marvel series to their original numbering. The *Amazing Spider-Man* was put back to its original numbering for #789. Issues #789 through 791 focused on the aftermath of Peter destroying Parker Industries and his fall from grace. Issues #792 and 793 were part of the *Venom Inc.* story. *Threat Level: Red* was the story for the next three issues which saw Norman Osborn obtain and bond with the Carnage symbiote. *Go Down Swinging* saw the results of the combination of Osborn's goblin serum and Carnage symbiote creating the Red Goblin. Issue No. 801 was Dan Slott's goodbye issue.\n\n\n\n### 2018 relaunch[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2018, it was announced that writer Nick Spencer would be writing the main semi-monthly *The Amazing Spider-Man* series beginning with a new No. 1, replacing long-time writer Dan Slott, as part of the Fresh Start relaunch that July.[106]\nThe first five-issue story arc was titled 'Back to Basics.' During the *Back to Basics* story, Kindred, a mysterious villain with some relation to Peter's past, was introduced, and Peter resumed his romantic relationship with Mary Jane once more. The first major story under Spencer was *Hunted* which ran through issues 16 through 23, the story also included four \".HU\" issues for issues 16, 18, 19, and 20. The end of the story saw the death of long-running Spider-Man villain Kraven the Hunter, being replaced by his clone son, The Last Son of Kraven.\n\n\n\n### 2020s[edit]\n\n\nIssue 45 kicked off the *Sins Rising* story which saw the resurrected Sin-Eater carry out the plans of Kindred to cleanse the world of sin, particularly that of Norman Osborn. The story concluded with issue 49, issue 850 in legacy numbering, seeing Spider-Man and Green Goblin team up to defeat Sin-Eater. *Last Remains* started in issue 50 and concluded in issue 55, the story saw Kindred's plans come to fruition as he tormented Spider-Man. The story has also seen five \".LR\" for issues 50, 51, 52, 53, and 54 which focused on The Order of the Web, a new faction of Spider-People consisting of Julia Carpenter (Madame Web), Miles Morales (Spider-Man), Gwen Stacy (Ghost-Spider), Cindy Moon (Silk), Jessica Drew (Spider-Woman), and Anya Corazon (Spider-Girl) . The story also revealed that Kindred is Harry Osborn. *Last Remains* also received two fallout issues called *Last Remains Post-Mortem*.\n\n\nNick Spencer concluded his run with the *Sinister War* story which wrapped up in No. 74 (legacy numbering 875). The story saw several retcons to the Spider-Man mythos including that Kindred was Gabriel and Sarah Stacy all along, the fact that the Stacy twins were actually genetically engineered beings using Norman Osborn and Gwen Stacy's DNA, that the Harry Osborn that returned in *Brand New Day* was actually a clone, and that Norman had made a deal with Mephisto where he sold Harry's soul to the demon. The story ended with the deaths of the Harry clone, Gabriel, and Sarah and the real Harry's soul being freed from Mephisto's grasp.\n\n\nAfter Spencer left the book, Marvel announced the \"Beyond\" era of Spider-Man would start in #75. The book would be moving back to the format it had during *Brand New Day* where it would have a rotating cast of writers including Kelly Thompson, Saladin Ahmed, Cody Ziglar, Patrick Gleason, and Zeb Wells. The book would also be released three times a month. \"Beyond\" would focus on Ben Reilly taking up the mantle of Spider-Man once again but backed by the Beyond corporation. Peter also falls ill and cannot be Spider-Man so he gives Ben his blessing to carry on as the main Spider-Man. However, following the conclusion of the storyline in #93, Peter has resumed active duties as Spider-Man, while Ben suffers a mental breakdown and becomes the villain Chasm.\n\n\n\n### 2022 relaunch[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2022, it was announced that writer Zeb Wells and John Romita Jr. would be working on a relaunched *The Amazing Spider-Man*, bringing the number of volumes for the title to its sixth, with the series beginning in April 2022 as a semi-monthly publication. The relaunch encompasses both a legacy numbering of #900 as well as the 60th anniversary for the character. The relaunch took place months after a mysterious event that left Peter on bad terms with the superhero community and ended his relationship with Mary Jane. He ends up taking a job at Oscorp and begins working closely with Norman Osborn and starts dating Black Cat. The volume's first crossover event was entitled *Dark Web*, with Chasm having teamed up with Madelyne Pryor to bring limbo to Earth. It's later revealed that Benjamin Rabin, the emissary of the Mayan god of mischief Wayeb', sent Peter and Mary Jane to an alternate dimension to conduct a ceremony that would allow Wayeb to control the Earth. Peter was sent back to his Earth, while due to the alternative passage of time, Mary Jane and Paul, Rabin's son in that dimension, spent four years in the realm together and adopted two children. When Peter eventually rescued them, Mary Jane refused to part with her new family. Rabin then planned to sacrifice Mary Jane to resurrect Wayeb, but is ultimately stopped by Ms. Marvel sacrificing herself, but not before Rabin reveals that Paul and Mary Jane's kids were illusions created by him and ceased their existence.\n\n\n\n## Contributors[edit]\n\n\n### Vol. 1 (1963-1998, 2003-2014, 2017-2018)[edit]\n\n\n#### Writers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Years\n | Writer\n | Issues\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1963–1972, 1973, 1980, 1984\n | Stan Lee | #1-100, #105-110, #116-118, #200 (epilogue), *Annual* #1-5, #18\n |\n| 1971-1972\n | Roy Thomas | #101-104\n |\n| 1972-1975\n | Gerry Conway | #111-149, *Giant-Size Super-Heroes* #1\n |\n| 1975-1978\n | Archie Goodwin | #150, #181, *Annual* #11\n |\n| 1975-1978\n | Len Wein | #151-181, *Annual* #10\n |\n| 1976-1978, 1981, 1983\n | Bill Mantlo | #181, #222, *Annual* #10-11, #17\n |\n| 1978–1980\n | Marv Wolfman | #182-204, *Annual* #13\n |\n| 1978\n | Jim Starlin | #187\n |\n| 1980, 1987-1994\n | David Michelinie | #205, #290-292, #296-352, #359-375, #377-388, *Annual* #21\n |\n| 1980, 1982-1984, 2009-2010\n | Roger Stern | #206, #224-227, #229-252, #580, #627-629, *Annual* #16-17\n |\n| 1980-1982\n | Dennis O’Neil | #207-219, #221, #223, *Annual* #14-15\n |\n| 1980\n | Jim Shooter | #208\n |\n| 1980\n | Mark Gruenwald | #208\n |\n| 1981\n | Michael Fleisher | #220\n |\n| 1981, 1987, 1994-1995\n | J.

Being in the mainstream continuity of the franchise, it was the character's first title, launching seven months after his introduction in the final issue of *Amazing Fantasy*. The series began publication with a March 1963 cover date and has been published nearly continuously to date over six volumes with only one significant interruption. Issues of the title currently feature an issue number within its sixth volume, as well as a \"legacy\" number reflecting the issue's overall number across all *Amazing Spider-Man* volumes. The title reached 900 issues in 2022.\n\n\nThe series began as a bimonthly periodical before being increased to monthly after four issues. It was the character's sole monthly headlining title until *Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man* launched in 1976. After 441 issues, *The Amazing Spider-Man* was restarted in 1999 as issue No. 1 of Volume 2. It ran for 58 issues before reverting to the title's overall issue number with #500 in 2003. The series ran essentially continuously over the first two volumes from 1963 until its landmark 700th issue at the end of 2012 when it was replaced by *The Superior Spider-Man* as part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch of Marvel's comic lines.[1] The title was occasionally published biweekly during the first two volumes, and was published three times a month from 2008 to 2010. After the relaunch of *Action Comics* and *Detective Comics* in 2011, *The Amazing Spider-Man* briefly became the highest-numbered active American comic book.\n\n\n*The Amazing Spider-Man* returned with volume 3 in April 2014 following the conclusion of *The Superior Spider-Man* story arc after 18 issues. In late 2015, the series was relaunched with a fourth volume following the 2015 *Secret Wars* event. After 32 issues, the volume was once again relaunched as part of *Marvel Legacy*, returning to the overall \"legacy\" numbering with issue No. 789 in late 2017. Less than a year later, the series was relaunched again with a fifth volume as part of Marvel's *Fresh Start*. For the first time, although the issue numbers were again restarted from #1, the issues also bore the overall \"legacy\" issue number. A sixth volume commenced in April 2022 to celebrate Spider-Man's 60th anniversary. Since the third volume, the title has had various release schedules, including monthly and bi-weekly, among others.\n\n\n\n\n## Publication history[edit]\n\n\nWriter-editor Stan Lee and artist and co-plotter Steve Ditko created the character of Spider-Man,[2] and the pair produced 38 issues from March 1963 to July 1966. Ditko left after the 38th issue, while Lee remained as writer until issue 100. Since then, many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic through the years, chronicling the adventures of Marvel's most identifiable hero.\n\n\n*The Amazing Spider-Man* has been the character's flagship series for his first fifty years in publication, and was the only monthly series to star Spider-Man until *Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man*, in 1976, although 1972 saw the debut of *Marvel Team-Up*, with the vast majority of issues featuring Spider-Man along with a rotating cast of other Marvel characters. Most of the major characters and villains of the Spider-Man saga have been introduced in *Amazing*, and with few exceptions, it is where most key events in the character's history have occurred. The title was published continuously until No. 441 (Nov. 1998)[3] when Marvel Comics relaunched it as vol. 2 No. 1 (Jan. 1999),[4] but on Spider-Man's 40th anniversary, this new title reverted to using the numbering of the original series, beginning again with issue No. 500 (Dec. 2003) and lasting until the final issue, No. 700 (Feb. 2013).[5]\n\n\n\n### 1960s[edit]\n\n\nDue to strong sales on the character's first appearance in *Amazing Fantasy* No. 15, Spider-Man was given his own ongoing series in March 1963.[6] The initial years of the series, under Lee and Ditko, chronicled Spider-Man's nascent career as a masked super-human vigilante with his civilian life as hard-luck yet perpetually good-humored and well-meaning teenager Peter Parker. Peter balanced his career as Spider-Man with his job as a freelance photographer for *The Daily Bugle* under the bombastic editor-publisher J. Jonah Jameson to support himself and his frail Aunt May. At the same time, Peter dealt with public hostility towards Spider-Man and the antagonism of his classmates Flash Thompson and Liz Allan at Midtown High School, while embarking on a tentative, ill-fated romance with Jameson's secretary, Betty Brant.\n\n\nBy focusing on Parker's everyday problems, Lee and Ditko created a groundbreakingly flawed, self-doubting superhero, and the first major teenaged superhero to be a protagonist and not a sidekick. Ditko's quirky art provided a stark contrast to the more cleanly dynamic stylings of Marvel's most prominent artist, Jack Kirby,[2] and combined with the humor and pathos of Lee's writing to lay the foundation for what became an enduring mythos.\n\n\nMost of Spider-Man's key villains and supporting characters were introduced during this time. Issue No. 1 (Mar. 1963) featured the first appearances of J. Jonah Jameson[7] and his astronaut son John Jameson,[8] and the supervillain the Chameleon.[7] It included the hero's first encounter with the superhero team the Fantastic Four. Issue No. 2 (May 1963) featured the first appearance of the Vulture[9] and the Tinkerer[10] as well as the beginning of Parker's freelance photography career at the newspaper *The Daily Bugle*.[11]\n\n\nThe Lee-Ditko era continued to usher in a significant number of villains and supporting characters, including Doctor Octopus in No. 3 (July 1963);[12][13] the Sandman and Betty Brant in No. 4 (Sept. 1963);[14] the Lizard in No. 6 (Nov. 1963);[15][16] Living Brain in No. 8 (Jan. 1964); Electro in No. 9 (Mar. 1964);[17][18] Mysterio in No. 13 (June 1964);[19] the Green Goblin in No. 14 (July 1964);[20][21] Kraven The Hunter in No. 15 (Aug. 1964);[22] reporter Ned Leeds in No. 18 (Nov. 1964);[23] and the Scorpion in No. 20 (Jan. 1965).[24] The Molten Man was introduced in No. 28 (Sept. 1965) which also featured Parker's graduation from high school.[25] Peter began attending Empire State University in No. 31 (Dec. 1965), which featured the first appearances of friends and classmates Gwen Stacy[26] and Harry Osborn.[27] Harry's father, Norman Osborn first appeared in No. 23 (April 1965) as a member of Jameson's country club but was not named nor revealed as Harry's father until No. 37 (June 1966).\n\n\nOne of the most celebrated issues of the Lee-Ditko run is No. 33 (Feb. 1966), the third part of the story arc \"If This Be My Destiny...!\", which features the dramatic scene of Spider-Man, through force of will and thoughts of family, escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that \"Steve Ditko squeezes every ounce of anguish out of Spider-Man's predicament, complete with visions of the uncle he failed and the aunt he has sworn to save.\"[28] Peter David observed that \"After his origin, this two-page sequence from *Amazing Spider-Man* No. 33 is perhaps the best-loved sequence from the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko era.\"[29] Steve Saffel stated the \"full page Ditko image from *The Amazing Spider-Man* No. 33 is one of the most powerful ever to appear in the series and influenced writers and artists for many years to come.\"[30] and Matthew K. Manning wrote that \"Ditko's illustrations for the first few pages of this Lee story included what would become one of the most iconic scenes in Spider-Man's history.\"[31] The story was chosen as No. 15 in the 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time poll of Marvel's readers in 2001. Editor Robert Greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story that \"These first five pages are a modern-day equivalent to Shakespeare as Parker's soliloquy sets the stage for his next action. And with dramatic pacing and storytelling, Ditko delivers one of the great sequences in all comics.\"[32]\n\n\nAlthough credited only as artist for most of his run, Ditko would eventually plot the stories as well as draw them, leaving Lee to script the dialogue. A rift between Ditko and Lee developed, and the two men were not on speaking terms long before Ditko completed his last issue, *The Amazing Spider-Man* No. 38 (July 1966). The exact reasons for the Ditko-Lee split have never been fully explained.[33] Spider-Man successor artist John Romita Sr., in a 2010 deposition, recalled that Lee and Ditko \"ended up not being able to work together because they disagreed on almost everything, cultural, social, historically, everything, they disagreed on characters...\"[34]\n\n\nIn successor penciler Romita Sr.'s first issue, No. 39 (Aug. 1966), nemesis the Green Goblin discovers Spider-Man's secret identity and reveals his own to the captive hero. Romita's Spider-Man – more polished and heroic-looking than Ditko's – became the model for two decades. The Lee-Romita era saw the introduction of such characters as *Daily Bugle* managing editor Robbie Robertson in No. 52 (Sept. 1967) and NYPD Captain George Stacy, father of Parker's girlfriend Gwen Stacy, in No. 56 (Jan. 1968). The most important supporting character to be introduced during the Romita era was Mary Jane Watson, who made her first full appearance in No. 42 (Nov. 1966),[35] although she first appeared in No. 25 (June 1965) with her face obscured and had been mentioned since No. 15 (Aug. 1964). Peter David wrote in 2010 that Romita \"made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling Mary Jane out from behind the oversized potted plant [that blocked the reader's view of her face in issue no. 25] and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment.\"[36] Romita has stated that in designing Mary Jane, he \"used Ann-Margret from the movie *Bye Bye Birdie* as a guide, using her coloring, the shape of her face, her red hair and her form-fitting short skirts.\"[37]\n\n\nLee and Romita toned down the prevalent sense of antagonism in Parker's world by improving Parker's relationship with the supporting characters and having stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man's adventures. The stories became more topical,[38] addressing issues such as civil rights, racism, prisoners' rights, the Vietnam War, and political elections.\n\n\nIssue No. 50 (June 1967) introduced the highly enduring criminal mastermind the Kingpin,[39][40] who would become a major force as well in the superhero series *Daredevil*. Other notable first appearances in the Lee-Romita era include the Rhino in No. 41 (Oct. 1966),[41][42] the Shocker in No. 46 (Mar. 1967),[43][44] the Prowler in No. 78 (Nov. 1969),[45] and the Kingpin's son, Richard Fisk, in No. 83 (Apr. 1970).[46]\n\n\n\n### 1970s[edit]\n\n\nSeveral spin-off series debuted in the 1970s: *Marvel Team-Up* in 1972,[47] and *The Spectacular Spider-Man* in 1976.[48] A short-lived series titled *Giant-Size Spider-Man* began in July 1974 and ran six issues through 1975.[49] *Spidey Super Stories*, a series aimed at children ages 6–10, ran for 57 issues from October 1974 through 1982.[50][51]\nThe flagship title's second decade took a grim turn with a story in #89-90 (Oct.-Nov. 1970) featuring the death of Captain George Stacy.[52] This was the first Spider-Man story to be penciled by Gil Kane,[53] who would alternate drawing duties with Romita for the next year-and-a-half and would draw several landmark issues.\n\n\nOne such story took place in the controversial issues #96–98 (May–July 1971). Writer-editor Lee defied the Comics Code Authority with this story, in which Parker's friend Harry Osborn, was hospitalized after over-dosing on pills. Lee wrote this story upon a request from the U. S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare for a story about the dangers of drugs. Citing its dictum against depicting drug use, even in an anti-drug context, the CCA refused to put its seal on these issues. With the approval of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman, Lee had the comics published without the seal. The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts.[54] The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs, among other new freedoms.[55]\n\n\n\"The Six Arms Saga\" of #100–102 (Sept.–Nov. 1971) introduced Morbius, the Living Vampire. The second installment was the first *Amazing Spider-Man* story not written by co-creator Lee,[56] with Roy Thomas taking over writing the book for several months before Lee returned to write #105–110 (Feb.-July 1972).[57] Lee, who was going on to become Marvel Comics' publisher, with Thomas becoming editor-in-chief, then turned writing duties over to 19-year-old Gerry Conway,[58] who scripted the series through 1975. Romita penciled Conway's first half-dozen issues, which introduced the gangster Hammerhead in No. 113 (Oct. 1972). Kane then succeeded Romita as penciler,[53] although Romita would continue inking Kane for a time.\n\n\nIssue 121 (June 1973 by Conway-Kane-Romita) featured the death of Gwen Stacy at the hands of the Green Goblin in \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died.\"[59][60][61] Her demise and the Goblin's apparent death one issue later formed a story arc widely considered as the most defining in the history of Spider-Man.[62] The aftermath of the story deepened both the characterization of Mary Jane Watson and her relationship with Parker.\n\n\nIn 1973 Gil Kane was succeeded by Ross Andru, whose run lasted from issue #125 (Oct. 1973) to #185 (Oct. 1978).[63] Issue#129 (Feb. 1974) introduced the Punisher,[64] who would become one of Marvel Comics' most popular characters. The Conway-Andru era featured the first appearances of the Man-Wolf in #124–125 (Sept.-Oct. 1973); the near-marriage of Doctor Octopus and Aunt May in #131 (Apr. 1974); Harry Osborn stepping into his father's role as the Green Goblin in #135–137 (Aug.-Oct.1974); and the original \"Clone Saga\", containing the introduction of Spider-Man's clone, in #147–149 (Aug.-Oct. 1975).\n\n\nArchie Goodwin and Gil Kane produced the title's 150th issue (Nov. 1975) before Len Wein became writer with issue No. 151.[65] During Wein's tenure, Harry Osborn and Liz Allen dated and became engaged; J. Jonah Jameson was introduced to his eventual second wife, Marla Madison; and Aunt May suffered a heart attack. Wein's last story on *Amazing* was a five-issue arc in #176–180 (Jan.-May 1978) featuring a third Green Goblin (Harry Osborn's psychiatrist, Bart Hamilton).\n\n\nMarv Wolfman, Marvel's editor-in-chief from 1975 to 1976, succeeded Wein as writer and, in his first issue, #182 (July 1978), had Parker propose marriage to Watson, who refused in the following issue.[66] Keith Pollard succeeded Andru as artist shortly afterward and, with Wolfman, introduced the likable rogue the Black Cat (Felicia Hardy) in #194 (July 1979).[67] As a love interest for Spider-Man, the Black Cat would go on to be an important supporting character for the better part of the next decade and remain a friend and occasional lover into the 2010s.\n\n\n\n### 1980s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*The Amazing Spider-Man* No. 252 (May 1984): Spider-Man's black costume debuts. Cover art by Ron Frenz and Klaus Janson.\n*The Amazing Spider-Man* #200 (Jan. 1980) featured the return and death of the burglar who killed Spider-Man's Uncle Ben.[68] Writer Marv Wolfman and penciler Keith Pollard both left the title by mid-year, succeeded by Dennis O'Neil, a writer known for groundbreaking 1970s work at rival DC Comics,[69] and penciler John Romita Jr. O'Neil wrote two issues of *The Amazing Spider-Man Annual* which were both drawn by Frank Miller. The 1980 *Annual* featured a team-up with Doctor Strange[70] while the 1981 *Annual* showcased a meeting with the Punisher.[71] Roger Stern, who had written nearly 20 issues of sister title *The Spectacular Spider-Man*, took over *Amazing* with #224 (Jan. 1982).[72] During his two years on the title, Stern augmented the backgrounds of long-established Spider-Man villains and, with Romita Jr., created the mysterious supervillain the Hobgoblin in #238–239 (Mar.–Apr. 1983).[73][74] Fans engaged with the mystery of the Hobgoblin's secret identity, which continued throughout #244–245 and 249–251 (Sept.-Oct. 1983 and Feb.-April 1984). One lasting change was the reintroduction of Mary Jane Watson as a more serious, mature woman who becomes Peter's confidante after she reveals that she knows his secret identity. Stern also wrote \"The Kid Who Collects Spider-Man\" in *The Amazing Spider-Man* #248 (Jan. 1984), a story which ranks among his most popular.[73][75]\n\n\nBy mid-1984, Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz took over scripting and penciling. DeFalco helped establish Parker and Watson's mature relationship, laying the foundation for the characters' wedding in 1987. Notably, in #257 (Oct. 1984), Watson tells Parker that she knows he is Spider-Man, and in #259 (Dec. 1984), she reveals to Parker the extent of her troubled childhood. Other notable issues of the DeFalco-Frenz era include #252 (May 1984), the first appearance of Spider-Man's black costume, which the hero would wear almost exclusively for the next four years' worth of comics; the debut of criminal mastermind the Rose in #253 (June 1984); the revelation in #258 (Nov. 1984) that the black costume is a living being, a symbiote; and the introduction of the female mercenary Silver Sable in #265 (June 1985).\n\n\nDeFalco and Frenz were both removed from *The Amazing Spider-Man* in 1986 by editor Jim Owsley under acrimonious circumstances.[76] A succession of artists including Alan Kupperberg, John Romita Jr., and Alex Saviuk penciled the series from 1987 to 1988, and Owsley wrote the book for the first half of 1987, scripting the five-part \"Gang War\" story (#284–288) that DeFalco plotted. Former *Spectacular Spider-Man* writer Peter David scripted #289 (June 1987), which revealed Ned Leeds as being the Hobgoblin although this was retconned in 1996 by Roger Stern into Leeds not being the original Hobgoblin after all.\n\n\nDavid Michelinie took over as writer in the next issue, for a story arc in #290–292 (July–Sept. 1987) that led to the marriage of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson in *Amazing Spider-Man Annual* No. 21. The \"Kraven's Last Hunt\" storyline by writer J.M. DeMatteis and artists Mike Zeck and Bob McLeod crossed over into *The Amazing Spider-Man* #293 and 294.[77] Issue No.298 (Mar. 1988) was the first Spider-Man comic to be drawn by future industry star Todd McFarlane, the first regular artist on *The Amazing Spider-Man* since Frenz's departure. McFarlane revolutionized Spider-Man's look. His depiction – \"Ditko-esque\" poses,[78] large eyes; wiry, contorted limbs; and messy, knotted, convoluted webbing – influenced the way virtually all subsequent artists would draw the character. McFarlane's other significant contribution to the Spider-Man canon was the design for what would become one of Spider-Man's most wildly popular antagonists, the supervillain Venom.[79] Issue No. 299 (Apr. 1988) featured Venom's first appearance (a last-page cameo) before his first full appearance in #300 (May 1988). The latter issue featured Spider-Man reverting to his original red-and-blue costume.\n\n\nOther notable issues of the Michelinie-McFarlane era include #312 (Feb. 1989), featuring the Green Goblin vs. the Hobgoblin; and #315–317 (May–July 1989), with the return of Venom. In July 2012, Todd McFarlane's original cover art for *The Amazing Spider-Man* No. 328 sold for a bid of $657,250, making it the most expensive American comic book art ever sold at auction.[80]\n\n\n\n### 1990s[edit]\n\n\nWith a civilian life as a married man, the Spider-Man of the 1990s was different from the superhero of the previous three decades. McFarlane left the title in 1990 to write and draw a new series titled simply *Spider-Man*. His successor, Erik Larsen, penciled the book from early 1990 to mid-1991. After issue No. 350, Larsen was succeeded by Mark Bagley, who had won the 1986 Marvel Tryout Contest[81] and was assigned a number of low-profile penciling jobs followed by a run on *New Warriors* in 1990. Bagley penciled the flagship Spider-Man title from 1991 to 1996.[82] During that time, Bagley's rendition of Spider-Man was used extensively for licensed material and merchandise.\n\n\nIssues #361–363 (April–June 1992) introduced Carnage,[83] a second symbiote nemesis for Spider-Man. The series' 30th-anniversary issue, No. 365 (Aug. 1992), was a double-sized, hologram-cover issue[84] with the cliffhanger ending of Peter Parker's parents, long thought dead, reappearing alive. It would be close to two years before they were revealed to be impostors, who are killed in No. 388 (April 1994), scripter Michelinie's last issue. His 1987–1994 stint gave him the second-longest run as writer on the title, behind Stan Lee.\n\n\nIssue No. 375 was released with a gold foil cover.[85] There was an error affecting some issues and which are missing the majority of the foil.[86]\n\n\nWith No. 389, writer J. M. DeMatteis, whose Spider-Man credits included the 1987 \"Kraven's Last Hunt\" story arc and a 1991–1993 run on *The Spectacular Spider-Man*, took over the title. From October 1994 to June 1996, *Amazing* stopped running stories exclusive to it, and ran installments of multi-part stories that crossed over into all the Spider-Man books. One of the few self-contained stories during this period was in No. 400 (April 1995), which featured the death of Aunt May – later revealed to have been faked (although the death still stands in the MC2 continuity). The \"Clone Saga\" culminated with the revelation that the Spider-Man who had appeared in the previous 20 years of comics was a clone of the real Spider-Man. This plot twist was massively unpopular with many readers,[87] and was later reversed in the \"Revelations\" story arc that crossed over the Spider-Man books in late 1996.\n\n\nThe Clone Saga tied into a publishing gap after No. 406 (Oct. 1995), when the title was temporarily replaced by *The Amazing Scarlet Spider* #1–2 (Nov.-Dec. 1995), featuring Ben Reilly. The series picked up again with No. 407 (Jan. 1996), with Tom DeFalco returning as writer. Bagley completed his 5½-year run by September 1996. A succession of artists, including Ron Garney, Steve Skroce, Joe Bennett, Rafael Kayanan and John Byrne penciled the book until the final issue, No. 441 (Nov. 1998), after which Marvel rebooted the title with vol. 2, No. 1 (Jan. 1999).\n\n\n\n### Relaunch and the 2000s[edit]\n\n\nMarvel began *The Amazing Spider-Man* relaunching the 'Amazing' comic book series with (vol. 2) #1 (Jan. 1999).[88][89] Howard Mackie wrote the first 29 issues. The relaunch included the Sandman being regressed to his criminal ways and the \"death\" of Mary Jane, which was ultimately reversed. Other elements included the introduction of a new Spider-Woman (who was spun off into her own short-lived series) and references to John Byrne's miniseries *Spider-Man: Chapter One*, which was launched at the same time as the reboot. Byrne also penciled issues #1–18 (from 1999 to 2000) and wrote #13–14, John Romita Jr. took his place soon after in October 2000. Mackie's run ended with *The Amazing Spider-Man Annual 2001*, which saw the return of Mary Jane, who then left Parker upon reuniting with him.\n\n\nWith issue No. 30 (June 2001), J. Michael Straczynski took over as writer[90] and oversaw additional storylines – most notably his lengthy \"Spider-Totem\" arc, which raised the issue of whether Spider-Man's powers were magic-based, rather than as the result of a radioactive spider's bite. Additionally, Straczynski resurrected the plot point of Aunt May discovering her nephew was Spider-Man,[91] and returned Mary Jane, with the couple reuniting in *The Amazing Spider-Man* (vol. 2) #50. Straczynski gave Spider-Man a new profession, having Parker teach at his former high school.\n\n\nIssue No. 30 began a dual numbering system, with the original series numbering (#471) returned and placed alongside the volume two number on the cover. Other longtime, rebooted Marvel Comics titles, including *Fantastic Four*, likewise were given the dual numbering around this time. After (vol. 2) #58 (Nov. 2003), the title reverted completely to its original numbering for issue No. 500 (Dec. 2003).[88] Mike Deodato, Jr. penciled the series from mid-2004 until 2006.\n\n\nThat year Peter Parker revealed his Spider-Man identity on live television in the company-crossover storyline \"Civil War\",[92][93] in which the superhero community is split over whether to conform to the federal government's new Superhuman Registration Act. This knowledge was erased from the world with the event of the four-part, crossover story arc, \"One More Day\", written partially by J. Michael Straczynski and illustrated by Joe Quesada, running through *The Amazing Spider-Man* #544–545 (Nov.-Dec. 2007), *Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man* No. 24 (Nov. 2007) and *The Sensational Spider-Man* No. 41 (Dec. 2007), the final issues of those two titles. Here, the demon Mephisto makes a Faustian bargain with Parker and Mary Jane, offering to save Parker's dying Aunt May if the couple will allow their marriage to have never existed, rewriting that portion of their pasts. This story arc marked the end of Straczynski's work on the title.\n\n\nFollowing this, Marvel made *The Amazing Spider-Man* the company's sole Spider-Man title, increasing its frequency of publication to three issues monthly, and inaugurating the series with a sequence of \"back to basics\" story arcs under the banner of \"Brand New Day\". Parker now exists in a changed world where he and Mary Jane had never married, and Parker has no memory of being married to her, with domino effect differences in their immediate world. The most notable of these revisions to Spider-Man continuity are the return of Harry Osborn, whose death in *The Spectacular Spider-Man* No. 200 (May 1993) is erased; and the reestablishment of Spider-Man's secret identity, with no one except Mary Jane able to recall that Parker is Spider-Man (although he soon reveals his secret identity to the New Avengers and the Fantastic Four). Under the banner of *Brand New Day*, Marvel tried to only use newly created villains instead of relying on older ones. Characters like Mister Negative and Overdrive both in Free Comic Book Day 2007 Spider-Man (July 2007), Menace in No. 549 (March 2008), Ana and Sasha Kravinoff in No. 565 (September 2008) and No. 567 (October 2008) respectively, and several more were introduced. The alternating regular writers were initially Dan Slott, Bob Gale, Marc Guggenheim, and Zeb Wells, joined by a rotation of artists that included Steve McNiven, Salvador Larroca, Phil Jimenez, Barry Kitson, Chris Bachalo, Mike McKone, Marcos Martín, and John Romita Jr. Joe Kelly, Mark Waid, Fred Van Lente and Roger Stern later joined the writing team and Paolo Rivera, Lee Weeks and Marco Checchetto the artist roster. Waid's work on the series included a meeting between Spider-Man and Stephen Colbert in *The Amazing Spider-Man* No. 573 (Dec. 2008).[94]\nIssue No. 583 (March 2009) included a back-up story in which Spider-Man meets President Barack Obama.[95][96]\n\n\n\n### 2010s and temporary end of publication[edit]\n\n\nMark Waid scripted the opening of \"The Gauntlet\" storyline in issue No. 612 (Jan. 2010).[97] The *Gauntlet* story was concluded by *Grim Hunt* (No. 634-637) which saw the resurrection of long-dead Spider-Man villain, Kraven the Hunter. The series became a twice-monthly title with Dan Slott as sole writer at issue No. 648 (Jan. 2011), launching the *Big Time* storyline.[98][99] Eight additional pages were added per issue. *Big Time* saw major changes in Spider-Man/Peter Parker's life, Peter would start working at Horizon Labs and begin a relationship with Carlie Cooper (his first serious relationship since his marriage to Mary Jane), Mac Gargan returned as Scorpion after spending the past few years as Venom, Phil Urich would take up the mantle of Hobgoblin, and the death of J. Jonah Jameson's wife, Marla Jameson. Issues 654 and 654.1 saw the birth of Agent Venom, Flash Thompson bonded with the Venom symbiote, which would lead to Venom getting his own series *Venom (volume 2)*. Starting in No. 659 and going to No. 665, the series built-up to the *Spider-Island* event which officially started in No. 666 and ended in No. 673. *Ends of the Earth* was the next event that ran from No. 682 through No. 687. This publishing format lasted until issue No. 700, which concluded the \"Dying Wish\" storyline, in which Parker and Doctor Octopus swapped bodies, and the latter taking on the mantle of Spider-Man when Parker apparently died in Doctor Octopus' body. *The Amazing Spider-Man* ended with this issue, with the story continuing in the new series *The Superior Spider-Man*.[100][101] Despite *The Superior Spider-Man* being considered a different series to *The Amazing Spider-Man*, the first 33 issue run goes towards the legacy numbering of *The Amazing Spider-Man* acting as issues 701–733. In December 2013, the series returned for five issues, numbered 700.1 through 700.5, with the first two written by David Morrell and drawn by Klaus Janson.[102]\n\n\n\n### 2014 relaunch[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2014, Marvel confirmed that *The Amazing Spider-Man* would be relaunched on April 30, 2014, starting from issue No. 1, with Peter Parker as Spider-Man once again.[103]\nThe first issue of this new version of *The Amazing Spider-Man* was, according to Diamond Comics Distributors, the \"best-selling comic book... in over a decade.\"[104]\nIssues #1–6 were a story arc called \"Lucky to be Alive\", taking place immediately after \"Goblin Nation\", with issues No. 4 and No. 5 being a crossover with the *Original Sin* storyline. Issue No. 4 introduced Silk, a new heroine who was bitten by the same spider as Peter Parker. Issues #7–8 featured a team-up between Ms. Marvel and Spider-Man, and had backup stories that tied into \"Edge of Spider-Verse\". The next major plot arc, titled \"Spider-Verse\", began in Issue No. 9 and ended in No. 15, features every Spider-Man from across the dimensions being hunted by Morlun, and a team-up to stop him, with Peter Parker of Earth-616 in command of the Spider-Men's Alliance. *The Amazing Spider-Man Annual* No. 1 of the relaunched series was released in December 2014, featuring stories unrelated to \"Spider-Verse\".\n\n\n\n### The Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, Marvel started the universe wide Secret Wars event where the core and several other Marvel universes were combined into one big planet called Battleworld. Battleworld was divided into sections with most of them being self-contained universes. Marvel announced that several of these self-contained universes would get their own tie in series and one of them was *Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows*, an alternate universe where Peter Parker and Mary Jane are still married and give birth to their child Annie May Parker, written by Dan Slott. Despite the series being considered separate from the main *Amazing Spider-Man* series, the original 5 issue run is counted towards its legacy numbering acting as No. 752-756.\n\n\n\n### 2015 relaunch[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the 2015 *Secret Wars* event, a number of Spider-Man-related titles were either relaunched or created as part of the \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\" event. Among them, *The Amazing Spider-Man* was relaunched as well and primarily focused on Peter Parker continuing to run Parker Industries and becoming a successful businessman operating worldwide.[105] It also tied with *Civil War II* (involving an Inhuman named Ulysses Cain who can predict possible futures), *Dead No More* (where Ben Reilly [the original Scarlet Spider] revealed to be revived and as one of the antagonists instead), and *Secret Empire* (during Hydra's reign led by a Hydra influenced Captain America/Steve Rogers, and the dismissal of Parker Industries by Peter Parker to stop Otto Octavius). Starting in September 2017, Marvel started the Marvel Legacy event which renumbered several Marvel series to their original numbering. The *Amazing Spider-Man* was put back to its original numbering for #789. Issues #789 through 791 focused on the aftermath of Peter destroying Parker Industries and his fall from grace. Issues #792 and 793 were part of the *Venom Inc.* story. *Threat Level: Red* was the story for the next three issues which saw Norman Osborn obtain and bond with the Carnage symbiote. *Go Down Swinging* saw the results of the combination of Osborn's goblin serum and Carnage symbiote creating the Red Goblin. Issue No. 801 was Dan Slott's goodbye issue.\n\n\n\n### 2018 relaunch[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2018, it was announced that writer Nick Spencer would be writing the main semi-monthly *The Amazing Spider-Man* series beginning with a new No. 1, replacing long-time writer Dan Slott, as part of the Fresh Start relaunch that July.[106]\nThe first five-issue story arc was titled 'Back to Basics.' During the *Back to Basics* story, Kindred, a mysterious villain with some relation to Peter's past, was introduced, and Peter resumed his romantic relationship with Mary Jane once more. The first major story under Spencer was *Hunted* which ran through issues 16 through 23, the story also included four \".HU\" issues for issues 16, 18, 19, and 20. The end of the story saw the death of long-running Spider-Man villain Kraven the Hunter, being replaced by his clone son, The Last Son of Kraven.\n\n\n\n### 2020s[edit]\n\n\nIssue 45 kicked off the *Sins Rising* story which saw the resurrected Sin-Eater carry out the plans of Kindred to cleanse the world of sin, particularly that of Norman Osborn. The story concluded with issue 49, issue 850 in legacy numbering, seeing Spider-Man and Green Goblin team up to defeat Sin-Eater. *Last Remains* started in issue 50 and concluded in issue 55, the story saw Kindred's plans come to fruition as he tormented Spider-Man. The story has also seen five \".LR\" for issues 50, 51, 52, 53, and 54 which focused on The Order of the Web, a new faction of Spider-People consisting of Julia Carpenter (Madame Web), Miles Morales (Spider-Man), Gwen Stacy (Ghost-Spider), Cindy Moon (Silk), Jessica Drew (Spider-Woman), and Anya Corazon (Spider-Girl) . The story also revealed that Kindred is Harry Osborn. *Last Remains* also received two fallout issues called *Last Remains Post-Mortem*.\n\n\nNick Spencer concluded his run with the *Sinister War* story which wrapped up in No. 74 (legacy numbering 875). The story saw several retcons to the Spider-Man mythos including that Kindred was Gabriel and Sarah Stacy all along, the fact that the Stacy twins were actually genetically engineered beings using Norman Osborn and Gwen Stacy's DNA, that the Harry Osborn that returned in *Brand New Day* was actually a clone, and that Norman had made a deal with Mephisto where he sold Harry's soul to the demon. The story ended with the deaths of the Harry clone, Gabriel, and Sarah and the real Harry's soul being freed from Mephisto's grasp.\n\n\nAfter Spencer left the book, Marvel announced the \"Beyond\" era of Spider-Man would start in #75. The book would be moving back to the format it had during *Brand New Day* where it would have a rotating cast of writers including Kelly Thompson, Saladin Ahmed, Cody Ziglar, Patrick Gleason, and Zeb Wells. The book would also be released three times a month. \"Beyond\" would focus on Ben Reilly taking up the mantle of Spider-Man once again but backed by the Beyond corporation. Peter also falls ill and cannot be Spider-Man so he gives Ben his blessing to carry on as the main Spider-Man. However, following the conclusion of the storyline in #93, Peter has resumed active duties as Spider-Man, while Ben suffers a mental breakdown and becomes the villain Chasm.\n\n\n\n### 2022 relaunch[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2022, it was announced that writer Zeb Wells and John Romita Jr. would be working on a relaunched *The Amazing Spider-Man*, bringing the number of volumes for the title to its sixth, with the series beginning in April 2022 as a semi-monthly publication. The relaunch encompasses both a legacy numbering of #900 as well as the 60th anniversary for the character. The relaunch took place months after a mysterious event that left Peter on bad terms with the superhero community and ended his relationship with Mary Jane. He ends up taking a job at Oscorp and begins working closely with Norman Osborn and starts dating Black Cat. The volume's first crossover event was entitled *Dark Web*, with Chasm having teamed up with Madelyne Pryor to bring limbo to Earth. It's later revealed that Benjamin Rabin, the emissary of the Mayan god of mischief Wayeb', sent Peter and Mary Jane to an alternate dimension to conduct a ceremony that would allow Wayeb to control the Earth. Peter was sent back to his Earth, while due to the alternative passage of time, Mary Jane and Paul, Rabin's son in that dimension, spent four years in the realm together and adopted two children. When Peter eventually rescued them, Mary Jane refused to part with her new family. Rabin then planned to sacrifice Mary Jane to resurrect Wayeb, but is ultimately stopped by Ms. Marvel sacrificing herself, but not before Rabin reveals that Paul and Mary Jane's kids were illusions created by him and ceased their existence.\n\n\n\n## Contributors[edit]\n\n\n### Vol. 1 (1963-1998, 2003-2014, 2017-2018)[edit]\n\n\n#### Writers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Years\n | Writer\n | Issues\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1963–1972, 1973, 1980, 1984\n | Stan Lee | #1-100, #105-110, #116-118, #200 (epilogue), *Annual* #1-5, #18\n |\n| 1971-1972\n | Roy Thomas | #101-104\n |\n| 1972-1975\n | Gerry Conway | #111-149, *Giant-Size Super-Heroes* #1\n |\n| 1975-1978\n | Archie Goodwin | #150, #181, *Annual* #11\n |\n| 1975-1978\n | Len Wein | #151-181, *Annual* #10\n |\n| 1976-1978, 1981, 1983\n | Bill Mantlo | #181, #222, *Annual* #10-11, #17\n |\n| 1978–1980\n | Marv Wolfman | #182-204, *Annual* #13\n |\n| 1978\n | Jim Starlin | #187\n |\n| 1980, 1987-1994\n | David Michelinie | #205, #290-292, #296-352, #359-375, #377-388, *Annual* #21\n |\n| 1980, 1982-1984, 2009-2010\n | Roger Stern | #206, #224-227, #229-252, #580, #627-629, *Annual* #16-17\n |\n| 1980-1982\n | Dennis O’Neil | #207-219, #221, #223, *Annual* #14-15\n |\n| 1980\n | Jim Shooter | #208\n |\n| 1980\n | Mark Gruenwald | #208\n |\n| 1981\n | Michael Fleisher | #220\n |\n| 1981, 1987, 1994-1995\n | J.

Directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by David Koepp, it is the first installment in Raimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy, produced by Columbia Pictures in association with Marvel Enterprises and Laura Ziskin Productions, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film stars Tobey Maguire as the titular character, alongside Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris. The film chronicles Spider-Man's origin story and early superhero career. After being bitten by a genetically altered spider, outcast teenager Peter Parker develops spider-like superhuman abilities and adopts a masked superhero identity to fight crime and injustice in New York City, facing the sinister Green Goblin in the process.\n\n\nDevelopment on a live-action Spider-Man film began in 1975. Filmmakers Tobe Hooper, James Cameron, and Joseph Zito were all attached to direct the film at one point. However, the project would languish in development hell due to licensing and financial issues. After progress on the film stalled for nearly 25 years, it was licensed for a worldwide release by Columbia Pictures in 1999 after it acquired options from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) on all previous scripts developed by Cannon Films, Carolco, and New Cannon. Exercising its option on just two elements from the multi-script acquisition (a different screenplay was written by James Cameron, Ted Newsom, John Brancato, Barney Cohen, and Joseph Goldman), Sony hired Koepp to create a working screenplay (credited as Cameron's), and Koepp received sole credit in final billing. Directors Roland Emmerich, Ang Lee, Chris Columbus, Barry Sonnenfeld, Tim Burton, Michael Bay, Jan de Bont, M. Night Shyamalan, Tony Scott, and David Fincher were considered to direct the project before Raimi was hired as director in 2000. The Koepp script was rewritten by Scott Rosenberg during pre-production and received a dialogue polish from Alvin Sargent during production. Filming took place in Los Angeles and New York City from January to June 2001. Danny Elfman was hired to compose the film's score, while Sony Pictures Imageworks handled the film's visual effects.[6]\n\n\n*Spider-Man* premiered at the Mann Village Theater on April 29, 2002, and was released in the United States on May 3. The film received positive reviews from audiences and critics who praised Raimi's direction, the story, the performances, visual effects, action sequences, and musical score. It was the first film to reach $100 million in a single weekend, as well as the most successful film based on a comic book at the time. With a box office gross of over $825 million worldwide, it was the third highest-grossing film of 2002, the highest-grossing superhero film, and the sixth-highest-grossing film overall at the time of its release. The film garnered nominations for Best Sound and Best Visual Effects at the 75th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. *Spider-Man* is credited for redefining the modern superhero genre, as well as the summer blockbuster.[7][8][9] After its success, the film spawned two sequels, *Spider-Man 2* (2004) and *Spider-Man 3* (2007). Maguire and Dafoe later reprised their roles in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (2021), which dealt with the concept of the multiverse and linked the Raimi trilogy to the MCU.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nOn a school trip, high school senior Peter Parker visits a Columbia University genetics laboratory with his friend Harry Osborn and his love interest Mary Jane Watson. There, a genetically engineered \"super-spider\" bites him, and he falls ill upon returning home. Meanwhile, Harry's father Norman Osborn, a scientist and the founder and owner of Oscorp, tries to secure an important military contract. He experiments on himself with an unstable performance-enhancing chemical and goes insane, killing his assistant.\n\n\nThe next day, Peter finds he is no longer near-sighted and has developed spider-like abilities: he can shoot webs out of his wrists and has quick reflexes, superhuman speed and strength, and a heightened ability to sense danger. Brushing off his Uncle Ben's advice that \"with great power comes great responsibility\", Peter considers buying a car to impress Mary Jane. He enters an underground wrestling event to win the money for it and wins his first match, but is cheated out of his earnings. After Ben is carjacked and killed moments later, Peter pursues the carjacker, only to find out it was a thief he let escape. The thief attempts to flee but dies after falling out a window. Meanwhile, a crazed Norman interrupts a product test by Oscorp's rival Quest Aerospace and kills several people.\n\n\nUpon graduating, Peter begins using his abilities to fight injustice, donning a spandex costume and the masked persona of Spider-Man. J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of the *Daily Bugle* newspaper, hires Peter as a freelance photographer, since he is the only person providing clear images of Spider-Man. Upon discovering that Oscorp's board plans to oust him to sell the company to Quest, Norman assassinates them. Jameson dubs the mysterious killer the \"Green Goblin.\"\n\n\nThe Goblin offers Peter a place at his side, but he refuses. They fight, and Peter is wounded. At Thanksgiving dinner, Peter's Aunt May invites Mary Jane, Harry, and Norman. During the dinner, Norman sees the wound and realizes Peter's identity. Thinking the only way to defeat Peter is to attack those special to him, Norman later attacks May, forcing her to be hospitalized. While visiting Aunt May at the hospital, Mary Jane admits her infatuation with Spider-Man, who has rescued her on two occasions. Harry, who is dating Mary Jane, sees her holding Peter's hand and assumes she has feelings for him. Devastated, Harry tells his father that Peter loves Mary Jane, unknowingly revealing Spider-Man's biggest weakness.\n\n\nNorman holds Mary Jane and a Roosevelt Island Tram car full of children hostage alongside the Queensboro Bridge. He forces Peter to choose whom he wants to save and drops them both. Peter saves both Mary Jane and the tram car. Norman then throws him into a nearby abandoned building and brutally beats him. Peter gains the upper hand, and Norman reveals himself and begs for forgiveness while subtly getting his glider ready to impale Peter from behind. Warned by his spider-sense, Peter dodges the attack, and the glider impales Norman instead. Norman tells Peter not to reveal his identity as the Goblin to Harry before dying. Peter takes Norman's body to the Osborn house and is confronted by Harry, who pulls a gun on him, but Peter escapes.\n\n\nAt Norman's funeral, Harry swears vengeance on Spider-Man, whom he falsely holds responsible for his father's death. Mary Jane confesses to Peter that she loves him. Peter, however, feels he must protect her from the unwanted attention of his enemies, so he hides his true feelings and tells Mary Jane that they can only be friends. As Peter leaves, he recalls Ben's words and accepts his new responsibility as Spider-Man.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n> \n> I felt like I was an outsider.

Ron Perkins portrays Mendel Stromm, Osborn's head scientist, while Gerry Becker and Jack Betts play board members Maximillian Fargas and Henry Balkan. Stanley Anderson plays General Slocum and Jim Ward plays the Project Coordinator. John Paxton portrays Bernard Houseman, the butler to the Osborn family. Joe Manganiello portrays Parker's bully and rival Flash Thompson, while Sally Livingstone portrays Liz Allan.[14] Jason Padgett portrays Flash's Crony.[15] Bill Nunn, Ted Raimi and Elizabeth Banks portray Daily Bugle editor Robbie Robertson, Daily Bugle employees Ted Hoffman, and Jameson's secretary Betty Brant, respectively.[16][17] Michael Papajohn appears as \"The Carjacker\", the robber who kills Ben Parker.[18] Bruce Campbell, a long-time colleague of director Sam Raimi, cameoed as the announcer at the wrestling ring Parker takes part in. Raimi himself appeared off-screen, throwing popcorn at Parker as he enters the arena to wrestle Bonesaw McGraw (played by former professional wrestler \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage), while Jack Murdock (played by former professional wrestler Scott L. Schwartz) is carried off on a stretcher.[19] Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee briefly appears in the film to grab a young girl from falling debris during the battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin at the World Unity Fair in Times Square.[20] Raimi originally thought Stan Lee doing a cameo in the film was a bad idea.[21]\n\n\nOctavia Spencer appears as a staff member at Parker's wrestling match.

In the early 1980s following the critical and commercial success of *Superman* (1978), which in turn was based on rival DC Comics’ flagship character Superman, Marvel Comics was in negotiations with film producers to bring their flagship character Spider-Man to the big screen. Producer Roger Corman was the first to hold an option on the Spider-Man property and began to develop the film at Orion Pictures. Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee was brought on to write a screenplay which featured Cold War themes and Doctor Octopus as the primary antagonist. The project did not come into fruition following budgetary disputes between Corman and Lee, as well as critical and commercial failure of *Superman III* (1983) making film adaptations of comic books a low priority.[32] The film rights were then acquired by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus of The Cannon Group for $225,000 in 1985.[33][34] The two were not familiar with the character's background and mistook Spider-Man for being similar to a werewolf-like character. Leslie Stevens, creator of *The Outer Limits*, was hired to write a screenplay based on this concept. Stevens' script featured Peter Parker as an ID-badge photographer who becomes subject to a mad scientist's experiment which transforms him into a human tarantula. Tobe Hooper, who was preparing to shoot *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2* and *Invaders from Mars* for Cannon, signed on to direct.[35] Lee hated the horror route the studio was taking with the character and demanded that a new script be written that was closer to the source material.[36][37]\n\n\nBy 1985, a new script was being written by Ted Newsom and John Brancato. In this version, Peter Parker receives his spider-like abilities from a cyclotron experiment. Doctor Octopus served as the antagonist and was written as Parker's mentor turned enemy. Barney Cohen was brought in to do a rewrite which added humor, additional action scenes, and a supporting villain.[38] Newsom and Brancato had John Cusack in mind for the part of Peter Parker.[39] Cannon hired Joseph Zito to direct the film having previously directed the commercially successful *Invasion U.S.A.* for the studio. For the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, the studio considered Tom Cruise while Zito was interested in casting actor and stuntman Scott Leva who had previously done promotional appearances as Spider-Man for Marvel.[40] Bob Hoskins was considered for Doctor Octopus while Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn were considered for Aunt May. The role of Uncle Ben was considered for Gregory Peck and Paul Newman. Lee expressed his desire to play J. Jonah Jameson in the film. The project was tentatively titled *Spider-Man: The Movie* and was budgeted between $15–20 million. Following the critical and financial failure of *Superman IV: The Quest for Peace* and *Masters of the Universe* which were produced by Cannon, the budget for *Spider-Man: The Movie* was cut to $7 million. Joseph Zito was unwilling to compromise and stepped down as director. He was replaced by Albert Pyun who was willing to make the film at a lower budget. The project was cancelled following Cannon's acquisition by Pathé and Golan's departure from the studio.[35]\n\n\nGolan extended his option on Spider-Man during his tenure as CEO of 21st Century Film Corporation. By 1989, Golan attempted to revive the project using the original script, budget, and storyboards developed at Cannon. In order to receive production funds, Golan sold the television rights to Viacom, home video rights to Columbia Pictures, and theatrical rights to Carolco Pictures[41] where James Cameron became attached to write and direct the film. Cameron had previously met with Stan Lee to discuss a possible X-Men film until Lee convinced Cameron that he would be a good choice to direct a Spider-Man film.[42] Cameron said superheroes were always fanciful to him.[43][44] James Cameron submitted a treatment to Carolco in 1993,[45] which served as a darker, more mature take on the character's mythos. In addition to featuring Spider-Man's origin story, it also included reimagined versions of the villains Electro and Sandman; the former was portrayed as a megalomaniacal businessman named Carlton Strand, while the latter was written as Strand's personal bodyguard named Boyd. Cameron's treatment also featured heavy profanity, and a sex scene between Spider-Man and Mary Jane Watson atop the Brooklyn Bridge. Carolco set a $50 million budget for *Spider-Man*, but progress stalled when Golan sued Carolco for attempting to make the film without his involvement.[46] Cameron had recently completed *True Lies* for 20th Century Fox as part of a production deal with the studio. Fox attempted to acquire the film rights to Spider-Man for Cameron but this proved unsuccessful. At this point, James Cameron had abandoned the project and began work on *Titanic*.[47] He would reveal in a 1997 interview on *The Howard Stern Show* that he had *Titanic* star Leonardo DiCaprio in mind for the lead role.[48] In 1995, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) acquired 21st Century Film Corporation which had given them access to the previous Spider-Man scripts. MGM then sued Viacom, Sony Pictures, and Marvel, who they accused of fraud in the original deal with Cannon. The following year, 21st Century, Carolco, and Marvel would all file for bankruptcy.[49]\n\n\nNo film studio showed interest in a Spider-Man movie following the disastrous reception of *Batman & Robin* in 1997, after which film studios no longer took the superhero genre seriously and had the perception that \"comic books were for kids\". However, the release of *Blade* by New Line Cinema in 1998 and the development of *X-Men* by 20th Century Fox convinced some studios that a Marvel character \"could carry on\" a movie.[50] Marvel would emerge from bankruptcy in 1998 and declare that Menahem Golan's option had expired and that the rights had reverted to them. Marvel would then sell the film rights to Sony Pictures Entertainment, Columbia Pictures' parent company for $7 million.[51] The deal came to effect in March 1999.[52]\n\n\nWhile John Calley was in work, training at Columbia, he sought with Kevin McClory's claim to develop an unofficial *James Bond* movie franchise, partially based on the material used on *Thunderball*, and also had the rights to the novel *Casino Royale*.[53] MGM and Danjaq also had to sue Sony Pictures and Spectre Associates, regarding claims of how the McClory film with Sony has been demonstrated.[54] The final blow came in March 1999, when Sony traded the *Casino Royale* film rights to MGM for the company's own *Spider-Man* project, thus starting right to production.[55][56]\n\n\nIn April 1999, although Sony Pictures optioned from MGM all preceding script versions of a *Spider-Man* film, it only exercised the options on \"the Cameron material\", which contractually included a multi-author screenplay and a forty-five-page \"scriptment\" credited only to James Cameron. The studio announced they were not hiring Cameron himself to direct the film nor would they be using his script.[57] The studio lined up Roland Emmerich, Tony Scott, Chris Columbus, Barry Sonnenfeld, Tim Burton, Michael Bay, Ang Lee, David Fincher, Jan de Bont and M. Night Shyamalan as potential directors.[58][59] However, most of the directors approached were less interested in the job than in the story itself.[50] Fincher did not want to depict the origin story, pitching the film as being based on *The Night Gwen Stacy Died* storyline, but the studio disagreed.[60] Columbus would later pass on the project to direct *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* instead.[61] Burton expressed a lack of interest by remarking that he was \"just a DC guy\", given his past work in *Batman* and *Batman Returns*.[50] Amy Pascal's choice for director was Sam Raimi.[62] Raimi was attached to direct in January 2000,[63] for a summer 2001 release.[64] He had been a fan of the comic book during his youth, and his passion for *Spider-Man* earned him the job.[65] Raimi's agent Josh Donen warned him that he was not Sony's preferred choice for the job, leading Raimi to cite all his reasons for which he would be the ideal director for the project during a meeting with Pascal, producer Laura Ziskin, Calley, Marvel Studios chief Avi Arad and film executive Matt Tolmach before abruptly ending his pitch after one hour, not wanting to overstay if Sony's executives did not want him.[50]\n\n\nDavid Koepp was brought aboard to write the screenplay and Cameron's work became the basis of his first draft screenplay, often word for word.[66] Koepp said that Cameron's script was \"influential\".[67] Koepp pitched the idea of having Peter Parker not getting his Spider-Man suit until after the film's first forty five minutes so they could stretch out the origin story and that Peter and Mary Jane would not get together at the end, feeling that them ending apart was romantic.[50] Cameron's versions of the Marvel villains Electro and Sandman remained the antagonists. Koepp's rewrite substituted the Green Goblin as the main antagonist and added Doctor Octopus as the secondary antagonist.[68] Raimi felt the Green Goblin and the surrogate father-son theme between Norman Osborn and Peter Parker would be more interesting, thus, he dropped Doctor Octopus from the film.[69] In June, Columbia hired Scott Rosenberg to rewrite Koepp's material. Remaining a constant in all the rewrites was the \"organic webshooter\" idea from the Cameron \"scriptment\".[70] Raimi felt he would stretch the audience's suspension of disbelief too far to have Parker invent mechanical webshooters.[71]\n\n\nRosenberg removed Doctor Octopus and created several new action sequences.[72] Raimi felt adding a third origin story would make the film too complex. Sequences removed from the final film had Spider-Man protecting Maximilian Fargas, the wheelchair-using Oscorp executive, from the Goblin, and Spider-Man defusing a hostage situation on a train.[60] As production neared, Ziskin hired award-winning writer Alvin Sargent, to polish the dialogue, primarily between Parker and Mary Jane.[73] Columbia gave the Writers Guild of America a list of four writers as contributors to the final *Spider-Man* script: Rosenberg, Sargent and James Cameron, all three of whom voluntarily relinquished credit to the fourth, Koepp.[66]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nFor the titular role, the filmmakers wanted someone who was not \"extraordinarily tall or handsome as Christopher Reeve\", but who could have the \"heart and soul\" for the audience to identify with.[50] The studio had expressed interest in actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Freddie Prinze Jr., Chris O'Donnell, Jude Law, Chris Klein, Ewan McGregor, Wes Bentley, and Heath Ledger.[74][60][75][76][77] DiCaprio had been considered by James Cameron for the role in 1995,[78] while Raimi joked that Prinze \"won't even be allowed to buy a ticket to see this film\".[60] Sony made overtures to Law about Spider-Man.[76] Pascal and her fellow executives pursued Ledger for the role due to her past collaborations, whereas Raimi met with Bentley but did not meet with DiCaprio or Ledger.[50] Bentley turned down the role as he was uninterested in superhero movies.[79] (Bentley would later play villain Blackheart / Legion in the film *Ghost Rider)*. In addition, actors Scott Speedman, Jay Rodan and James Franco were involved in screen tests for the lead role (Franco would ultimately land the role of Harry Osborn).[80] Joe Manganiello also auditioned for the role.[81] He would eventually win the role as Parker's bully, Eugene \"Flash\" Thompson.[81] Tobey Maguire was ultimately cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in July 2000,[82] having been Sam Raimi's primary choice for the role after he saw *The Cider House Rules*.[27] The studio was initially hesitant to cast someone who did not seem to fit the ranks of \"adrenaline-pumping, tail-kicking titans\",[82] but Maguire managed to impress studio executives with his audition. The actor was signed for a deal in the range of $3 to $4 million with higher salary options for two sequels.[82] To prepare, Maguire was trained by a physical trainer, a yoga instructor, a martial arts expert, and a climbing expert, taking several months to improve his physique.[71][83] Maguire studied spiders and worked with a wire man to simulate the arachnid-like motion and had a special diet, though he tried to be as fit as possible due to being a vegan.[84][50]\n\n\nNicolas Cage, Jason Isaacs, John Malkovich and Billy Bob Thornton were considered for the role of Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, but turned down the role.[85][86][87][88] Willem Dafoe was cast as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin in November 2000.[89] Raimi met with Dafoe while he was filming a movie in Spain.[90] He felt attracted at the prospect of working with Raimi and the idea of making a comic book movie.[50][91] Dafoe insisted on wearing the uncomfortable costume as he felt that a stuntman would not convey the character's necessary body language. The 580-piece suit took half an hour to put on.[60]\n\n\nKate Bosworth unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Mary Jane Watson.[92] Elizabeth Banks also auditioned for the role but she was told by Producer Laura Ziskin that she was too old for the role and was cast as Betty Brant instead.[93][94] Kate Hudson turned down the role.[95] Eliza Dushku,[96] Mena Suvari and Jaime King also auditioned for the role.[97] Before Raimi cast Kirsten Dunst, he had expressed his interest in casting Alicia Witt.[98] Dunst decided to audition after learning Maguire had been cast, feeling the film would have a more independent feel.[99] Dunst earned the role a month before shooting in an audition in Berlin.[60] Her hair was dyed in the front and she wore a half-wig.[100] The crew wanted her to straighten her teeth but she refused.[101]\n\n\nJ. K. Simmons was cast as J. Jonah Jameson, though he learned about his casting through a Spider-Man fan who had read the news of his casting at a fan website three hours before his agent contacted him to inform him that he had gotten the role.[102] Despite Stan Lee's longtime interest in playing Jameson, the filmmakers agreed that he was too old to convincingly play the part, but Lee was supportive of Simmons' casting, feeling that Simmons did better than he would have done.[103]\n\n\nHugh Jackman, who starred as Logan / Wolverine in the *X-Men* film series, stated in September 2013 that he was approached to appear as Wolverine in the film in either a gag or just for a cameo appearance. However, when Jackman arrived to New York to shoot the scene, plans for his appearance never materialized because the filmmakers were unable to get the costume Jackman had used in *X-Men*.[104]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nWith *Spider-Man* cast, filming was set to begin November 2000 in New York City and on Sony soundstages. The film was set for release in November 2001,[82] but was postponed to be released on May 3, 2002, due to an expected extended post-production schedule.[105]\n\n\nPrincipal photography officially began on January 8, 2001, in Culver City, California.[73] After the September 11 attacks happened that year, certain sequences were re-filmed, and a shot of the Twin Towers was removed from the film which can be found on the Sony Stock Footage website.[106][107][108] Sony's Stage 29 was used for Parker's Forest Hills home, and Stage 27 was used for the wrestling sequence where Parker takes on Bonesaw McGraw (Randy Savage). Stage 27 was also used for the complex Times Square sequence where Spider-Man and the Goblin battle for the first time, where a three-story set with a breakaway balcony piece was built. The scene also required shooting in Downey, California.[109] On March 6,[110] 45-year-old construction worker Tim Holcombe was killed when a forklift modified as a construction crane crashed into a construction basket that he was in. The following court case led to the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health to fine Sony $58,805.[111] Raimi rented out a Warner Bros. Studio lot for the set to use to film the upside down kiss scene.[112] Kirsten Dunst said that filming the upside down kiss scene was not so romantic, she said that Maguire could not breathe as water was pouring down into his nose while hanging upside down.[113] Dunst also called shooting the scene \"awful\".[114] Maguire also said that he was gasping for air.[115] He and Franco had tension on set due to Franco's infatuation with Dunst, who was dating Maguire at the time.[116] Randy Savage refused a Stunt Double to do a mid-flip so Savage did the stunt and injured himself.[117] The scene where Peter catches Mary Jane and the food tray was done completely in camera, with Maguire's hand glued to the tray. The scene took 156 takes in 16 hours to accomplish.[118][119]\n\n\nIn Los Angeles, locations included the Natural History Museum (for the Columbia University lab where Parker is bitten and receives his powers), the Pacific Electricity Building (the *Daily Bugle* offices) and Greystone Mansion (for the interiors of Norman Osborn's home), the latter of which was the set that was used for *Batman*.[120] In April, 4 of the Spider-Man costumes were stolen, and Sony put up a $25,000 reward for their return.[121] They were recovered after 18 months and a former movie studio security guard and an accomplice were arrested.[122][123][124] Production moved to New York City for two weeks, taking in locations such as the Queensboro Bridge, the exteriors of Columbia University's Low Memorial Library and the New York Public Library, and a rooftop garden in the Rockefeller Center.[109] The crew returned to Los Angeles where production continued, filming wrapped in June 2001.[73] The Flatiron Building was used for the *Daily Bugle*.[73]\n\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The original animatronic headgear for the Green Goblin was created by Amalgamated Dynamics.\nThe Green Goblin's original headgear was an animatronic mask created by Amalgamated Dynamics.[125] Dafoe described it as a \"Halloween mask\" and \"kind of silly-looking\", and the designers instead came up with a modern, angular helmet.[50] Dafoe also wanted the costume to be flexible enough to allow him to do splits.[126]\n\n\nTo create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape.[127] One concept costume designer James Acheson became fond of was the idea of having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the legs.[60] In early development, Acheson experimented with a potential helmet-like design for the suit, which was then scrapped. It was designed as a single piece, including the mask. A hard shell was worn underneath the mask to make the shape of the head look better and to keep the mask tight while keeping the wearer comfortable. For scenes in which Spider-Man would take his mask off, there was an alternate suit where the mask was a separate piece. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.[128]\n\n\nFor the spider that gives Peter his powers in the film, Raimi selected the Steatoda grossa, which was painted with red and blue makeup.[129]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\nVisual effects supervisor John Dykstra was hired to produce the film's visual effects in May 2000.[130] Dykstra met with Raimi while he was filming *The Gift* (2000).[131] He convinced Raimi to make many of the stunts computer-generated imagery, as they would have been physically impossible. Raimi had used more traditional special effects in his previous films and learned a lot about using computers during production.[65] Raimi worked hard to plan all the sequences of Spider-Man swinging from buildings, which he described as, \"ballet in the sky.\" The complexity of such sequences meant the budget rose from an initially planned $70 million to around $100 million.[27] Shots were made more complicated because of the main characters' individual color schemes, so Spider-Man and the Green Goblin had to be shot separately for effects shots: Spider-Man was shot in front of a greenscreen, while the Green Goblin was shot against bluescreen. Shooting them together would have resulted in one character being erased from a shot.[60]\n\n\nDykstra said the biggest difficulty of creating Spider-Man was that as the character was masked, it immediately lost a lot of characterization. Without the context of eyes or mouth, a lot of body language had to be put in so that there would be emotional content. Raimi wanted to convey the essence of Spider-Man as being, \"the transition that occurs between him being a young man going through puberty and being a superhero.\" Dykstra said his crew of animators had never reached such a level of sophistication to give subtle hints of still making Spider-Man feel like a human being.[132] When two studio executives were shown shots of the computer generated character, they believed it was actually Maguire performing stunts.[60] In addition, Dykstra's crew had to composite areas of New York City and replaced every car in shots with digital models. Raimi did not want it to feel entirely like animation, so none of the shots were 100% computer-generated.[133]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Music from and Inspired by Spider-Man and Spider-Man: Original Motion Picture Score\n\nDanny Elfman composed the music for the film. Its soundtrack combines traditional orchestration, ethnic percussion, and electronic elements. Its distinct ethnic characteristics are credited to Elfman, who spent a year in Africa studying its unique percussion.[134]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Original *Spider-Man* teaser poster, which was recalled from theaters following 9/11 (the World Trade Center is reflected in Spider-Man's eyes)\nAfter the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, Sony recalled a teaser poster which showed a close-up of Spider-Man's head with the World Trade Center towers reflected in his eyes.[135][136] The film's original teaser trailer, released that same year, featured a mini-film plot involving a group of bank robbers escaping in a Eurocopter AS355 Twin Squirrel helicopter, which gets caught from behind and propelled backward into what at first appears to be a net, then is shown to be a gigantic spider web spun between the World Trade Center towers.[137] This trailer was attached to the screenings of *Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within*, *Jurassic Park III*, *Planet of the Apes*, *Rush Hour 2*, and *American Pie 2*. According to Sony, the trailer did not contain any actual footage from the film itself.[138] Both the trailer and poster were removed after the events of the attacks, but can be found online.[139] Additionally, the home video release of *A Knight's Tale* would also have the *Spider-Man* trailer taken out.[140][141] New teaser posters featuring Spider-Man and the Green Goblin were unveiled in November 2001.[142] A month later, a new trailer deemed acceptable by Sony debuted on television during *Temptation Island* and in theaters with *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*.[143] Raimi later stated that the scene was, in fact, originally in the film but removed due to the recency of the attacks.[144] Another *Spider-Man* trailer premiered online on March 27, 2002, and in theaters with the releases of *Panic Room* and *The Rookie* just two days later on March 29.[145]\n\n\nTo promote the release of the film, Sony partnered with CKE Restaurants to release kids meal toys at Hardee's and Carl's Jr. restaurants. Beginning in April 2002, the locations offered customers three different *Spider-Man* collector's cups and patrons could purchase a Spider-Man figure to attach to their car radio antenna. A month later in May, \"Cool Combos for Kids\" would feature one of four different toys highlighting Spider-Man or his nemesis, the Green Goblin.[146] KFC would then follow suit, releasing their own *Spider-Man* kids meal toys at their locations in the United Kingdom.[147] Other promotional partners included Dr Pepper, Hershey's, Kellogg's, and Reebok.[148]\n\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nIn the U.S., it was rated \"PG-13\" for \"stylized violence and action\".[149] Before the film's British theatrical release in June 2002, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) gave the film a \"12\" certificate. Due to *Spider-Man*'s popularity with younger children, this prompted much controversy. The BBFC defended its decision, arguing that the film could have been given a \"15\". Despite this, North Norfolk and Breckland District Councils, in East Anglia, changed it to a \"PG\", and Tameside council, Manchester, denoted it a \"PG-12\". In late August, the BBFC relaxed its policy to \"12A\", leading Sony to re-release the film.[150][151]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Spider-Man* was released on DVD and VHS on November 1, 2002, in North America and Australia, and on November 25, 2002, in the UK.[152] Over 7 million DVD copies were sold on the first day of release.[153] The film would hold the record for having the highest single-day DVD sales until it was taken by *Finding Nemo* in 2003.[154] As of 2022, it has the single-day record for any live-action film.[155] In just a few days, the DVD release sold more than 11 million copies, beating *Monsters, Inc.* and setting records for any DVD release.[156] While the VHS release sold over 6.5 million copies, the DVD release went on to become one of the best-selling live-action DVD titles of all time with over 19.5 million copies being sold.[157][158] This two-disc DVD release comes in widescreen (1.85:1 aspect ratio) and fullscreen (specifically reframed 1.33:1 aspect ratio digitally mastered from the original source and specially reframed by the filmmakers themselves without gutting out portions of the frame using pan and scan) versions.

Following comparable debuts of *Deep Impact* in 1998 and *The Mummy* in 1999, the frame was taken to the next level in 2001 with the release of *The Mummy Returns*. *Spider-Man* had not only made history for a summer starter film, but for weekends as well.[171] It surpassed *The Lost World: Jurassic Park* to have the largest May opening weekend. When the film was released, it was ranked number one at the box office, beating *The Scorpion King*.[172] The film also broke *X-Men*'s record for having the highest opening weekend for a superhero film.[169]\n\n\nThe film also set a record for crossing the $100 million milestone in three days, at the time being the fastest any film had reached the mark.[173] This opening weekend haul had an average of $31,769 per theater, which at the time, Box Office Mojo reported as being \"the highest per theater average ever for an ultra-wide release.\"[169] The film's three-day record was surpassed by *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* four years later.[174] The $114.8 million opening weekend was the highest at the North America box office film for a non-sequel, until it was surpassed eight years later by *Alice in Wonderland*.[175] *Spider-Man* would hold the record for having the highest-three day gross until it was surpassed by *Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith* in 2005.[176] Within four days, it had the biggest non-holiday Monday of all time with $11 million, increasing the total gross to $125.1 million and staying ahead of recent blockbusters, including *Charlie's Angels* and *Erin Brockovich*.[177]\n\n\nWith the film's release in the United States and Canada on May 3, 2002, on 7,500 screens at 3,615 theaters,[170] the film earned $39,406,872 on its opening day, averaging $10,901 per theater.[178] This was the highest opening day at the time until it was surpassed by its sequel *Spider-Man 2*'s $40.4 million haul in 2004.[179] For three years, the film would hold the record for having the highest Friday gross until 2005 when it was overtaken by *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*.[180] Upon its opening, it had the third-highest number of screenings of any film, behind *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* and *Mission: Impossible 2*.[169] *Spider-Man* also set an all-time record for the highest earnings in a single day with $43,622,264 on its second day of release,[169][178] a record later surpassed by *Shrek 2* in 2004.[181] On the Sunday during its opening weekend, the film earned an additional $31,814,980,[178] the highest gross a film took in on a Sunday, at the time.[169]\n\n\nThe film stayed at the top position in its second weekend ahead of *Unfaithful*, dropping only 38% and grossing another $71,417,527,[182] while averaging $19,755.89 per theater. At the time, this was the highest-grossing second weekend of any film.[182] During its second weekend, the film reached the $200 million mark on its ninth day of release, also a record at the time.[182] This made it the fastest film to cross the $200 million mark, surpassing *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*.[183] At the end of its second weekend, the film brought in a 10-day total of $223,040,031.[182] It quickly surpassed *Ice Age* to become the highest-grossing film of the year. *Spider-Man* had crossed over 149 spots on the top-grossing film chart, landing in 29th place between *Rush Hour 2* and *Mrs. Doubtfire* while excelling past the final tallies of other films, including *Batman Forever*, *Mission: Impossible 2* and *The Mummy Returns*.[182]\n\n\nThe film dropped to the second position in its third weekend, behind *Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones*, but still made $45,036,912, dropping only 37%, averaging $12,458 per theater, and bringing the 17-day tally to $285,573,668.[184] Its third weekend haul set the record for highest-grossing third weekend, which was first surpassed by *Avatar* (2009).[185] *Spider-Man* would beat another record that was previously held by *The Phantom Menace*, becoming the quickest film to hit $300 million in just 22 days.[186] It stayed at the second position in its fourth weekend, grossing $35,814,844 over the four-day Memorial Day frame, dropping only 21% while expanding to 3,876 theaters, averaging $9,240 over four days, and bringing the 25-day gross to $333,641,492.[187] Within 66 days, it was the fastest film to approach $400 million, tying its record with *Titanic*.[188] Both films held this record for two years before being surpassed by *Shrek 2*.[189]\n\n\nAt the box office, *Spider-Man* became 2002's highest-grossing film with $407,022,860 in the U.S. and Canada, defeating *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* and *Attack of the Clones*.[190] As of 2021, *Spider-Man* ranks as the 37th-highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S. and Canada, not adjusted for inflation. The film also grossed $418,002,176 from its international markets, bringing its worldwide total to $825,025,036[191] making it 2002's third-highest-grossing film behind *The Two Towers* and *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* and the 58th-highest-grossing film of all time, worldwide.[192] Additionally, it was the highest-grossing Sony film of all time, beating out *Men in Black*.[193][194] *Spider-Man* also dethroned *Batman*'s record for becoming the highest-grossing superhero film of all time.[193][195] The film sold an estimated 69,484,700 tickets in the US.[191] It held the record for most tickets sold by a comic book movie until *The Dark Knight* topped it in 2008. As of 2020, it is still the sixth highest grossing comic book movie of all time adjusted for inflation. Only *Avengers: Infinity War*, *The Dark Knight*, *Black Panther*, *The Avengers* and *Avengers: Endgame* have sold more tickets than *Spider-Man*. *Spider-Man* was the highest-grossing superhero origin film, a record it held for 15 years until it was surpassed by *Wonder Woman* (2017).[196][197] As of 2020, it is the 12th-highest-grossing superhero film, as well as the 12th-highest-grossing comic book adaptation in general.[198][199][200]\n\n\nInternationally, *Spider-Man* opened in 17 territories in its first week, earning a total of $13.3 million. It scored the second-highest opening in Iceland, Singapore and South Korea. Plus, Russia and Yugoslavia had the third best all time film opening.[201] *Spider-Man* would score the biggest opening in Switzerland with $1.4 million and 160,000 admissions from 106 screens, surpassing *The World Is Not Enough*. As for Germany, it had the strongest June opening and the third best debut of any movie, behind *Attack of the Clones* and *Ice Age*. Its opening screenings in France were a massive 10,645 admissions from 27 screens, beating out the French film *Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra*.[202] Additionally, it set the highest opening gross in Spain.[203] Meanwhile, *Spider-Man* would go on to unleash new opening records in the UK during the 2002 FIFA World Cup soccer game. The film made $13.9 million from 509 screens, making it the country's fifth biggest movie opening, trailing only behind *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, *The Phantom Menace*, *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* and *Attack of the Clones*. In addition, *Spider-Man* had the largest opening of any film in the UK with a BBFC certificate higher than a \"PG\" rating, staying ahead of *Independence Day* and *Hannibal*. Despite lunch matches, it still led the weekend box office to a bigger 110% week-to-week increase and a 130% year-on-year increase when *Pearl Harbor* led the chart during its third week.[204] It was the country's number one film for three weeks until it was displaced by *Minority Report*.[205] In India, the film was simultaneously released in English and three different languages across 250 screens, becoming the widest reach and return for a Hollywood title since *The Mummy Returns* in 2001. It was even Sony's first major release in the country since *Godzilla* in 1998.[206] The total number of international markets that generated grosses in excess of $10 million include Australia ($16.9 million), Brazil ($17.4 million), France, Algeria, Monaco, Morocco and Tunisia ($32.9 million), Germany ($30.7 million), Italy ($20.8 million), Japan ($56.2 million), Mexico ($31.2 million), South Korea ($16.98 million), Spain ($23.7 million), and the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($45.8 million).[207]\n\n\n*Spider-Man* became the highest-grossing superhero film of all time at the time of its release, both domestically and worldwide while surpassing *Batman*.[193] Its domestic gross was eventually topped by *The Dark Knight* (2008). Its worldwide gross was first surpassed by *Spider-Man 3* (2007).\n\n\nThe film also held the record as Sony's highest-grossing film domestically until 2018, when it was finally surpassed by *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* ($404.5 million).[208][209]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of 249 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Not only does *Spider-Man* provide a good dose of web-swinging fun, it also has a heart, thanks to the combined charms of director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire.\"[210] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[211] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[212]\n\n\nThe casting, mainly Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe and J. K. Simmons, is often cited as one of the film's high points. Eric Harrison, of the *Houston Chronicle*, was initially skeptical of the casting of Maguire, but after seeing the film he stated, \"it becomes difficult to imagine anyone else in the role.\"[213] *USA Today* critic Mike Clark believed the casting rivaled that of Christopher Reeve as 1978's *Superman*.[214] Owen Gleiberman, of *Entertainment Weekly*, had mixed feelings about the casting, particularly Tobey Maguire. \"Maguire, winning as he is, never quite gets the chance to bring the two sides of Spidey—the boy and the man, the romantic and the avenger—together.\"[215] *The Hollywood Reporter*'s Kirk Honeycutt thought: \"the filmmakers' imaginations work in overdrive from the clever design of the cobwebby opening credits and Spider-Man and M.J.'s upside down kiss—after one of his many rescues of her—to a finale that leaves character relationships open ended for future adventures.\"[216]\n\n\n*LA Weekly*'s Manohla Dargis wrote, \"It isn't that Spider-Man is inherently unsuited for live-action translation; it's just that he's not particularly interesting or, well, animated.\"[217] Giving it two and a half stars out of four, Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* felt that the film lacked a decent action element: \"Consider the scene where Spider-Man is given a cruel choice between saving Mary Jane or a cable car full of school kids. He tries to save both, so that everyone dangles from webbing that seems about to pull loose. The visuals here could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved, but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea.\"[218]\nStylistically, there was heavy criticism of the Green Goblin's costume, which led *IGN*'s Richard George to comment years later: \"We're not saying the comic book costume is exactly thrilling, but the Goblin armor (the helmet in particular) from *Spider-Man* is almost comically bad... Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression.\"[219]\n\n\n*Entertainment Weekly* put \"the kiss in *Spider-Man*\" on its end-of-the-decade \"best-of\" list, saying: \"There's a fine line between romantic and corny. And the rain-soaked smooch between Spider-Man and Mary Jane from 2002 tap-dances right on that line. The reason it works? Even if she suspects he's Peter Parker, she doesn't try to find out. And that's sexy.\"[220]\n\n\n*Empire* magazine ranked *Spider-Man* 437 in its *500 Greatest Movies of All Time* list in 2008.[221]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by the 2002–2007 Spider-Man film series\n\nThe film won several awards ranging from Teen Choice Awards to the Saturn Awards, and was also nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound (Kevin O'Connell, Greg P. Russell and Ed Novick), but lost to *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* and *Chicago*, respectively.[222][223] While only Danny Elfman brought home a Saturn Award, Raimi, Maguire, and Dunst were all nominated for their respective positions. It also took home the People's Choice Award for \"Favorite Motion Picture.\"[223] The film was nominated for Favorite Movie at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, but lost to *Austin Powers in Goldmember*.\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\n### Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3\n\nTwo sequels to *Spider-Man* were produced and directed by Sam Raimi: *Spider-Man 2* was released on June 30, 2004, while *Spider-Man 3* was released on May 4, 2007.\n\n\n\n### Animated television series[edit]\n\n\nA CGI/spin-off animated series, *Spider-Man: The New Animated Series*, ran on July to September 2003; it was intended to be the continuation of the first film, and was an alternate sequel to the film different from the events of the later sequels.[224]\n\n\n\n## Video game[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spider-Man (2002 video game)\n\nA video game based on the film of the same name was released.[225] The game was developed by Treyarch (only for the home consoles) and published by Activision, and released in 2002 for Game Boy Advance, GameCube, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. The game has many scenes and villains that did not appear in the film. It was followed by *Spider-Man 2* two years later to promote the release of the second film. In 2007, to promote the release of the third film, *Spider-Man 3* was released. Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe were the only actors who reprised their roles from the film. *Spider-Man: Friend or Foe* was released in 2007, the games borrow the film characters, and it serves as non-canon plot of the film series.[226]\n\n\nThe critical reviews for the game were positive. By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of *Spider-Man* had sold 2.1 million copies and earned $74 million in the United States. *Next Generation* ranked it as the 15th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of *Spider-Man* console games released in the 2000s reached 6 million units in the United States by July 2006.[227]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Spider-Man\". *AFI Catalog of Feature Films*.

Directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by David Koepp, it is the first installment in Raimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy, produced by Columbia Pictures in association with Marvel Enterprises and Laura Ziskin Productions, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film stars Tobey Maguire as the titular character, alongside Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris. The film chronicles Spider-Man's origin story and early superhero career. After being bitten by a genetically altered spider, outcast teenager Peter Parker develops spider-like superhuman abilities and adopts a masked superhero identity to fight crime and injustice in New York City, facing the sinister Green Goblin in the process.\n\n\nDevelopment on a live-action Spider-Man film began in 1975. Filmmakers Tobe Hooper, James Cameron, and Joseph Zito were all attached to direct the film at one point. However, the project would languish in development hell due to licensing and financial issues. After progress on the film stalled for nearly 25 years, it was licensed for a worldwide release by Columbia Pictures in 1999 after it acquired options from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) on all previous scripts developed by Cannon Films, Carolco, and New Cannon. Exercising its option on just two elements from the multi-script acquisition (a different screenplay was written by James Cameron, Ted Newsom, John Brancato, Barney Cohen, and Joseph Goldman), Sony hired Koepp to create a working screenplay (credited as Cameron's), and Koepp received sole credit in final billing. Directors Roland Emmerich, Ang Lee, Chris Columbus, Barry Sonnenfeld, Tim Burton, Michael Bay, Jan de Bont, M. Night Shyamalan, Tony Scott, and David Fincher were considered to direct the project before Raimi was hired as director in 2000. The Koepp script was rewritten by Scott Rosenberg during pre-production and received a dialogue polish from Alvin Sargent during production. Filming took place in Los Angeles and New York City from January to June 2001. Danny Elfman was hired to compose the film's score, while Sony Pictures Imageworks handled the film's visual effects.[6]\n\n\n*Spider-Man* premiered at the Mann Village Theater on April 29, 2002, and was released in the United States on May 3. The film received positive reviews from audiences and critics who praised Raimi's direction, the story, the performances, visual effects, action sequences, and musical score. It was the first film to reach $100 million in a single weekend, as well as the most successful film based on a comic book at the time. With a box office gross of over $825 million worldwide, it was the third highest-grossing film of 2002, the highest-grossing superhero film, and the sixth-highest-grossing film overall at the time of its release. The film garnered nominations for Best Sound and Best Visual Effects at the 75th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. *Spider-Man* is credited for redefining the modern superhero genre, as well as the summer blockbuster.[7][8][9] After its success, the film spawned two sequels, *Spider-Man 2* (2004) and *Spider-Man 3* (2007). Maguire and Dafoe later reprised their roles in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (2021), which dealt with the concept of the multiverse and linked the Raimi trilogy to the MCU.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nOn a school trip, high school senior Peter Parker visits a Columbia University genetics laboratory with his friend Harry Osborn and his love interest Mary Jane Watson. There, a genetically engineered \"super-spider\" bites him, and he falls ill upon returning home. Meanwhile, Harry's father Norman Osborn, a scientist and the founder and owner of Oscorp, tries to secure an important military contract. He experiments on himself with an unstable performance-enhancing chemical and goes insane, killing his assistant.\n\n\nThe next day, Peter finds he is no longer near-sighted and has developed spider-like abilities: he can shoot webs out of his wrists and has quick reflexes, superhuman speed and strength, and a heightened ability to sense danger. Brushing off his Uncle Ben's advice that \"with great power comes great responsibility\", Peter considers buying a car to impress Mary Jane. He enters an underground wrestling event to win the money for it and wins his first match, but is cheated out of his earnings. After Ben is carjacked and killed moments later, Peter pursues the carjacker, only to find out it was a thief he let escape. The thief attempts to flee but dies after falling out a window. Meanwhile, a crazed Norman interrupts a product test by Oscorp's rival Quest Aerospace and kills several people.\n\n\nUpon graduating, Peter begins using his abilities to fight injustice, donning a spandex costume and the masked persona of Spider-Man. J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of the *Daily Bugle* newspaper, hires Peter as a freelance photographer, since he is the only person providing clear images of Spider-Man. Upon discovering that Oscorp's board plans to oust him to sell the company to Quest, Norman assassinates them. Jameson dubs the mysterious killer the \"Green Goblin.\"\n\n\nThe Goblin offers Peter a place at his side, but he refuses. They fight, and Peter is wounded. At Thanksgiving dinner, Peter's Aunt May invites Mary Jane, Harry, and Norman. During the dinner, Norman sees the wound and realizes Peter's identity. Thinking the only way to defeat Peter is to attack those special to him, Norman later attacks May, forcing her to be hospitalized. While visiting Aunt May at the hospital, Mary Jane admits her infatuation with Spider-Man, who has rescued her on two occasions. Harry, who is dating Mary Jane, sees her holding Peter's hand and assumes she has feelings for him. Devastated, Harry tells his father that Peter loves Mary Jane, unknowingly revealing Spider-Man's biggest weakness.\n\n\nNorman holds Mary Jane and a Roosevelt Island Tram car full of children hostage alongside the Queensboro Bridge. He forces Peter to choose whom he wants to save and drops them both. Peter saves both Mary Jane and the tram car. Norman then throws him into a nearby abandoned building and brutally beats him. Peter gains the upper hand, and Norman reveals himself and begs for forgiveness while subtly getting his glider ready to impale Peter from behind. Warned by his spider-sense, Peter dodges the attack, and the glider impales Norman instead. Norman tells Peter not to reveal his identity as the Goblin to Harry before dying. Peter takes Norman's body to the Osborn house and is confronted by Harry, who pulls a gun on him, but Peter escapes.\n\n\nAt Norman's funeral, Harry swears vengeance on Spider-Man, whom he falsely holds responsible for his father's death. Mary Jane confesses to Peter that she loves him. Peter, however, feels he must protect her from the unwanted attention of his enemies, so he hides his true feelings and tells Mary Jane that they can only be friends. As Peter leaves, he recalls Ben's words and accepts his new responsibility as Spider-Man.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n> \n> I felt like I was an outsider. I think what happened to me made me develop this street sense of watching people and working out what made them tick, wondering whether I could trust them or not. I went to a lot of schools along the coast in California, made few friends and stayed with aunts, uncles and grandparents while my folks tried to make ends meet. It was tough. We had no money.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Tobey Maguire on identifying with Peter Parker.[10]\n\n* Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:  \nAn academically gifted high school student who is socially inept. After a genetically engineered spider bites him, he gains spider-like powers, including super-strength, enhanced reflexes, a \"spider sense\" that warns him of incoming danger, and the ability to climb walls and shoot spiderwebs (in a departure from the comics, where he utilizes web-shooters). Following a personal tragedy, he decides to use his newfound powers for good, and begins fighting crime and injustice as Spider-Man.\n* Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin:  \nA scientist and the CEO of Oscorp who tests an unstable strength enhancer on himself and develops a crazed alternate personality.

Raimi himself appeared off-screen, throwing popcorn at Parker as he enters the arena to wrestle Bonesaw McGraw (played by former professional wrestler \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage), while Jack Murdock (played by former professional wrestler Scott L. Schwartz) is carried off on a stretcher.[19] Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee briefly appears in the film to grab a young girl from falling debris during the battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin at the World Unity Fair in Times Square.[20] Raimi originally thought Stan Lee doing a cameo in the film was a bad idea.[21]\n\n\nOctavia Spencer appears as a staff member at Parker's wrestling match. Tig Notaro was offered the role by Raimi and auditioned, but lost it to Spencer.[22] R&B/soul singer Macy Gray appears as herself performing at the World Unity Fair.[23] Lucy Lawless also appears as a punk rock girl who says \"Guy with eight hands... sounds hot.\"[24][25] She did the appearance as a favor to her husband, *Xena: Warrior Princess* creator Rob Tapert, on which Raimi had served as an executive producer alongside Tapert.[26] One of the stunt performers in this film is actor Johnny Tri Nguyen.[27] Kickboxer Benny \"The Jet\" Urquidez has an uncredited cameo as a mugger who attacks Mary Jane. Comedian Jim Norton shows up in one scene as a truck driver who has an unfavorable opinion of Spider-Man.[28] R.C.

K. Dodds plays Simkins, Scott Spiegel plays a Marine Cop, while Larry Joshua plays a promoter who cheats Parker out of his winnings. Hugh Jackman, who played Logan / Wolverine in Fox's *X-Men* film series was planned to have a cameo appearance as the character, with Jackman even arriving in New York to shoot the scene, only for it to be scrapped after the production team realized they did not have the character's suit.[31]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Spider-Man in film § Development\n\nBeginning in 1975, Marvel Comics made plans to bring their characters to the big screen. In the early 1980s following the critical and commercial success of *Superman* (1978), which in turn was based on rival DC Comics’ flagship character Superman, Marvel Comics was in negotiations with film producers to bring their flagship character Spider-Man to the big screen. Producer Roger Corman was the first to hold an option on the Spider-Man property and began to develop the film at Orion Pictures. Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee was brought on to write a screenplay which featured Cold War themes and Doctor Octopus as the primary antagonist. The project did not come into fruition following budgetary disputes between Corman and Lee, as well as critical and commercial failure of *Superman III* (1983) making film adaptations of comic books a low priority.[32] The film rights were then acquired by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus of The Cannon Group for $225,000 in 1985.[33][34] The two were not familiar with the character's background and mistook Spider-Man for being similar to a werewolf-like character. Leslie Stevens, creator of *The Outer Limits*, was hired to write a screenplay based on this concept. Stevens' script featured Peter Parker as an ID-badge photographer who becomes subject to a mad scientist's experiment which transforms him into a human tarantula. Tobe Hooper, who was preparing to shoot *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2* and *Invaders from Mars* for Cannon, signed on to direct.[35] Lee hated the horror route the studio was taking with the character and demanded that a new script be written that was closer to the source material.[36][37]\n\n\nBy 1985, a new script was being written by Ted Newsom and John Brancato. In this version, Peter Parker receives his spider-like abilities from a cyclotron experiment. Doctor Octopus served as the antagonist and was written as Parker's mentor turned enemy. Barney Cohen was brought in to do a rewrite which added humor, additional action scenes, and a supporting villain.[38] Newsom and Brancato had John Cusack in mind for the part of Peter Parker.[39] Cannon hired Joseph Zito to direct the film having previously directed the commercially successful *Invasion U.S.A.* for the studio. For the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, the studio considered Tom Cruise while Zito was interested in casting actor and stuntman Scott Leva who had previously done promotional appearances as Spider-Man for Marvel.[40] Bob Hoskins was considered for Doctor Octopus while Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn were considered for Aunt May. The role of Uncle Ben was considered for Gregory Peck and Paul Newman. Lee expressed his desire to play J. Jonah Jameson in the film. The project was tentatively titled *Spider-Man: The Movie* and was budgeted between $15–20 million. Following the critical and financial failure of *Superman IV: The Quest for Peace* and *Masters of the Universe* which were produced by Cannon, the budget for *Spider-Man: The Movie* was cut to $7 million. Joseph Zito was unwilling to compromise and stepped down as director. He was replaced by Albert Pyun who was willing to make the film at a lower budget. The project was cancelled following Cannon's acquisition by Pathé and Golan's departure from the studio.[35]\n\n\nGolan extended his option on Spider-Man during his tenure as CEO of 21st Century Film Corporation. By 1989, Golan attempted to revive the project using the original script, budget, and storyboards developed at Cannon. In order to receive production funds, Golan sold the television rights to Viacom, home video rights to Columbia Pictures, and theatrical rights to Carolco Pictures[41] where James Cameron became attached to write and direct the film. Cameron had previously met with Stan Lee to discuss a possible X-Men film until Lee convinced Cameron that he would be a good choice to direct a Spider-Man film.[42] Cameron said superheroes were always fanciful to him.[43][44] James Cameron submitted a treatment to Carolco in 1993,[45] which served as a darker, more mature take on the character's mythos. In addition to featuring Spider-Man's origin story, it also included reimagined versions of the villains Electro and Sandman; the former was portrayed as a megalomaniacal businessman named Carlton Strand, while the latter was written as Strand's personal bodyguard named Boyd. Cameron's treatment also featured heavy profanity, and a sex scene between Spider-Man and Mary Jane Watson atop the Brooklyn Bridge. Carolco set a $50 million budget for *Spider-Man*, but progress stalled when Golan sued Carolco for attempting to make the film without his involvement.[46] Cameron had recently completed *True Lies* for 20th Century Fox as part of a production deal with the studio. Fox attempted to acquire the film rights to Spider-Man for Cameron but this proved unsuccessful. At this point, James Cameron had abandoned the project and began work on *Titanic*.[47] He would reveal in a 1997 interview on *The Howard Stern Show* that he had *Titanic* star Leonardo DiCaprio in mind for the lead role.[48] In 1995, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) acquired 21st Century Film Corporation which had given them access to the previous Spider-Man scripts. MGM then sued Viacom, Sony Pictures, and Marvel, who they accused of fraud in the original deal with Cannon. The following year, 21st Century, Carolco, and Marvel would all file for bankruptcy.[49]\n\n\nNo film studio showed interest in a Spider-Man movie following the disastrous reception of *Batman & Robin* in 1997, after which film studios no longer took the superhero genre seriously and had the perception that \"comic books were for kids\". However, the release of *Blade* by New Line Cinema in 1998 and the development of *X-Men* by 20th Century Fox convinced some studios that a Marvel character \"could carry on\" a movie.[50] Marvel would emerge from bankruptcy in 1998 and declare that Menahem Golan's option had expired and that the rights had reverted to them. Marvel would then sell the film rights to Sony Pictures Entertainment, Columbia Pictures' parent company for $7 million.[51] The deal came to effect in March 1999.[52]\n\n\nWhile John Calley was in work, training at Columbia, he sought with Kevin McClory's claim to develop an unofficial *James Bond* movie franchise, partially based on the material used on *Thunderball*, and also had the rights to the novel *Casino Royale*.[53] MGM and Danjaq also had to sue Sony Pictures and Spectre Associates, regarding claims of how the McClory film with Sony has been demonstrated.[54] The final blow came in March 1999, when Sony traded the *Casino Royale* film rights to MGM for the company's own *Spider-Man* project, thus starting right to production.[55][56]\n\n\nIn April 1999, although Sony Pictures optioned from MGM all preceding script versions of a *Spider-Man* film, it only exercised the options on \"the Cameron material\", which contractually included a multi-author screenplay and a forty-five-page \"scriptment\" credited only to James Cameron. The studio announced they were not hiring Cameron himself to direct the film nor would they be using his script.[57] The studio lined up Roland Emmerich, Tony Scott, Chris Columbus, Barry Sonnenfeld, Tim Burton, Michael Bay, Ang Lee, David Fincher, Jan de Bont and M. Night Shyamalan as potential directors.[58][59] However, most of the directors approached were less interested in the job than in the story itself.[50] Fincher did not want to depict the origin story, pitching the film as being based on *The Night Gwen Stacy Died* storyline, but the studio disagreed.[60] Columbus would later pass on the project to direct *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* instead.[61] Burton expressed a lack of interest by remarking that he was \"just a DC guy\", given his past work in *Batman* and *Batman Returns*.[50] Amy Pascal's choice for director was Sam Raimi.[62] Raimi was attached to direct in January 2000,[63] for a summer 2001 release.[64] He had been a fan of the comic book during his youth, and his passion for *Spider-Man* earned him the job.[65] Raimi's agent Josh Donen warned him that he was not Sony's preferred choice for the job, leading Raimi to cite all his reasons for which he would be the ideal director for the project during a meeting with Pascal, producer Laura Ziskin, Calley, Marvel Studios chief Avi Arad and film executive Matt Tolmach before abruptly ending his pitch after one hour, not wanting to overstay if Sony's executives did not want him.[50]\n\n\nDavid Koepp was brought aboard to write the screenplay and Cameron's work became the basis of his first draft screenplay, often word for word.[66] Koepp said that Cameron's script was \"influential\".[67] Koepp pitched the idea of having Peter Parker not getting his Spider-Man suit until after the film's first forty five minutes so they could stretch out the origin story and that Peter and Mary Jane would not get together at the end, feeling that them ending apart was romantic.[50] Cameron's versions of the Marvel villains Electro and Sandman remained the antagonists. Koepp's rewrite substituted the Green Goblin as the main antagonist and added Doctor Octopus as the secondary antagonist.[68] Raimi felt the Green Goblin and the surrogate father-son theme between Norman Osborn and Peter Parker would be more interesting, thus, he dropped Doctor Octopus from the film.[69] In June, Columbia hired Scott Rosenberg to rewrite Koepp's material. Remaining a constant in all the rewrites was the \"organic webshooter\" idea from the Cameron \"scriptment\".[70] Raimi felt he would stretch the audience's suspension of disbelief too far to have Parker invent mechanical webshooters.[71]\n\n\nRosenberg removed Doctor Octopus and created several new action sequences.[72] Raimi felt adding a third origin story would make the film too complex. Sequences removed from the final film had Spider-Man protecting Maximilian Fargas, the wheelchair-using Oscorp executive, from the Goblin, and Spider-Man defusing a hostage situation on a train.[60] As production neared, Ziskin hired award-winning writer Alvin Sargent, to polish the dialogue, primarily between Parker and Mary Jane.[73] Columbia gave the Writers Guild of America a list of four writers as contributors to the final *Spider-Man* script: Rosenberg, Sargent and James Cameron, all three of whom voluntarily relinquished credit to the fourth, Koepp.[66]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nFor the titular role, the filmmakers wanted someone who was not \"extraordinarily tall or handsome as Christopher Reeve\", but who could have the \"heart and soul\" for the audience to identify with.[50] The studio had expressed interest in actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Freddie Prinze Jr., Chris O'Donnell, Jude Law, Chris Klein, Ewan McGregor, Wes Bentley, and Heath Ledger.[74][60][75][76][77] DiCaprio had been considered by James Cameron for the role in 1995,[78] while Raimi joked that Prinze \"won't even be allowed to buy a ticket to see this film\".[60] Sony made overtures to Law about Spider-Man.[76] Pascal and her fellow executives pursued Ledger for the role due to her past collaborations, whereas Raimi met with Bentley but did not meet with DiCaprio or Ledger.[50] Bentley turned down the role as he was uninterested in superhero movies.[79] (Bentley would later play villain Blackheart / Legion in the film *Ghost Rider)*. In addition, actors Scott Speedman, Jay Rodan and James Franco were involved in screen tests for the lead role (Franco would ultimately land the role of Harry Osborn).[80] Joe Manganiello also auditioned for the role.[81] He would eventually win the role as Parker's bully, Eugene \"Flash\" Thompson.[81] Tobey Maguire was ultimately cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in July 2000,[82] having been Sam Raimi's primary choice for the role after he saw *The Cider House Rules*.[27] The studio was initially hesitant to cast someone who did not seem to fit the ranks of \"adrenaline-pumping, tail-kicking titans\",[82] but Maguire managed to impress studio executives with his audition. The actor was signed for a deal in the range of $3 to $4 million with higher salary options for two sequels.[82] To prepare, Maguire was trained by a physical trainer, a yoga instructor, a martial arts expert, and a climbing expert, taking several months to improve his physique.[71][83] Maguire studied spiders and worked with a wire man to simulate the arachnid-like motion and had a special diet, though he tried to be as fit as possible due to being a vegan.[84][50]\n\n\nNicolas Cage, Jason Isaacs, John Malkovich and Billy Bob Thornton were considered for the role of Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, but turned down the role.[85][86][87][88] Willem Dafoe was cast as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin in November 2000.[89] Raimi met with Dafoe while he was filming a movie in Spain.[90] He felt attracted at the prospect of working with Raimi and the idea of making a comic book movie.[50][91] Dafoe insisted on wearing the uncomfortable costume as he felt that a stuntman would not convey the character's necessary body language. The 580-piece suit took half an hour to put on.[60]\n\n\nKate Bosworth unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Mary Jane Watson.[92] Elizabeth Banks also auditioned for the role but she was told by Producer Laura Ziskin that she was too old for the role and was cast as Betty Brant instead.[93][94] Kate Hudson turned down the role.[95] Eliza Dushku,[96] Mena Suvari and Jaime King also auditioned for the role.[97] Before Raimi cast Kirsten Dunst, he had expressed his interest in casting Alicia Witt.[98] Dunst decided to audition after learning Maguire had been cast, feeling the film would have a more independent feel.[99] Dunst earned the role a month before shooting in an audition in Berlin.[60] Her hair was dyed in the front and she wore a half-wig.[100] The crew wanted her to straighten her teeth but she refused.[101]\n\n\nJ. K. Simmons was cast as J. Jonah Jameson, though he learned about his casting through a Spider-Man fan who had read the news of his casting at a fan website three hours before his agent contacted him to inform him that he had gotten the role.[102] Despite Stan Lee's longtime interest in playing Jameson, the filmmakers agreed that he was too old to convincingly play the part, but Lee was supportive of Simmons' casting, feeling that Simmons did better than he would have done.[103]\n\n\nHugh Jackman, who starred as Logan / Wolverine in the *X-Men* film series, stated in September 2013 that he was approached to appear as Wolverine in the film in either a gag or just for a cameo appearance. However, when Jackman arrived to New York to shoot the scene, plans for his appearance never materialized because the filmmakers were unable to get the costume Jackman had used in *X-Men*.[104]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nWith *Spider-Man* cast, filming was set to begin November 2000 in New York City and on Sony soundstages. The film was set for release in November 2001,[82] but was postponed to be released on May 3, 2002, due to an expected extended post-production schedule.[105]\n\n\nPrincipal photography officially began on January 8, 2001, in Culver City, California.[73] After the September 11 attacks happened that year, certain sequences were re-filmed, and a shot of the Twin Towers was removed from the film which can be found on the Sony Stock Footage website.[106][107][108] Sony's Stage 29 was used for Parker's Forest Hills home, and Stage 27 was used for the wrestling sequence where Parker takes on Bonesaw McGraw (Randy Savage). Stage 27 was also used for the complex Times Square sequence where Spider-Man and the Goblin battle for the first time, where a three-story set with a breakaway balcony piece was built. The scene also required shooting in Downey, California.[109] On March 6,[110] 45-year-old construction worker Tim Holcombe was killed when a forklift modified as a construction crane crashed into a construction basket that he was in. The following court case led to the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health to fine Sony $58,805.[111] Raimi rented out a Warner Bros. Studio lot for the set to use to film the upside down kiss scene.[112] Kirsten Dunst said that filming the upside down kiss scene was not so romantic, she said that Maguire could not breathe as water was pouring down into his nose while hanging upside down.[113] Dunst also called shooting the scene \"awful\".[114] Maguire also said that he was gasping for air.[115] He and Franco had tension on set due to Franco's infatuation with Dunst, who was dating Maguire at the time.[116] Randy Savage refused a Stunt Double to do a mid-flip so Savage did the stunt and injured himself.[117] The scene where Peter catches Mary Jane and the food tray was done completely in camera, with Maguire's hand glued to the tray. The scene took 156 takes in 16 hours to accomplish.[118][119]\n\n\nIn Los Angeles, locations included the Natural History Museum (for the Columbia University lab where Parker is bitten and receives his powers), the Pacific Electricity Building (the *Daily Bugle* offices) and Greystone Mansion (for the interiors of Norman Osborn's home), the latter of which was the set that was used for *Batman*.[120] In April, 4 of the Spider-Man costumes were stolen, and Sony put up a $25,000 reward for their return.[121] They were recovered after 18 months and a former movie studio security guard and an accomplice were arrested.[122][123][124] Production moved to New York City for two weeks, taking in locations such as the Queensboro Bridge, the exteriors of Columbia University's Low Memorial Library and the New York Public Library, and a rooftop garden in the Rockefeller Center.[109] The crew returned to Los Angeles where production continued, filming wrapped in June 2001.[73] The Flatiron Building was used for the *Daily Bugle*.[73]\n\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The original animatronic headgear for the Green Goblin was created by Amalgamated Dynamics.\nThe Green Goblin's original headgear was an animatronic mask created by Amalgamated Dynamics.[125] Dafoe described it as a \"Halloween mask\" and \"kind of silly-looking\", and the designers instead came up with a modern, angular helmet.[50] Dafoe also wanted the costume to be flexible enough to allow him to do splits.[126]\n\n\nTo create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape.[127] One concept costume designer James Acheson became fond of was the idea of having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the legs.[60] In early development, Acheson experimented with a potential helmet-like design for the suit, which was then scrapped. It was designed as a single piece, including the mask. A hard shell was worn underneath the mask to make the shape of the head look better and to keep the mask tight while keeping the wearer comfortable. For scenes in which Spider-Man would take his mask off, there was an alternate suit where the mask was a separate piece. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.[128]\n\n\nFor the spider that gives Peter his powers in the film, Raimi selected the Steatoda grossa, which was painted with red and blue makeup.[129]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\nVisual effects supervisor John Dykstra was hired to produce the film's visual effects in May 2000.[130] Dykstra met with Raimi while he was filming *The Gift* (2000).[131] He convinced Raimi to make many of the stunts computer-generated imagery, as they would have been physically impossible. Raimi had used more traditional special effects in his previous films and learned a lot about using computers during production.[65] Raimi worked hard to plan all the sequences of Spider-Man swinging from buildings, which he described as, \"ballet in the sky.\" The complexity of such sequences meant the budget rose from an initially planned $70 million to around $100 million.[27] Shots were made more complicated because of the main characters' individual color schemes, so Spider-Man and the Green Goblin had to be shot separately for effects shots: Spider-Man was shot in front of a greenscreen, while the Green Goblin was shot against bluescreen. Shooting them together would have resulted in one character being erased from a shot.[60]\n\n\nDykstra said the biggest difficulty of creating Spider-Man was that as the character was masked, it immediately lost a lot of characterization. Without the context of eyes or mouth, a lot of body language had to be put in so that there would be emotional content. Raimi wanted to convey the essence of Spider-Man as being, \"the transition that occurs between him being a young man going through puberty and being a superhero.\" Dykstra said his crew of animators had never reached such a level of sophistication to give subtle hints of still making Spider-Man feel like a human being.[132] When two studio executives were shown shots of the computer generated character, they believed it was actually Maguire performing stunts.[60] In addition, Dykstra's crew had to composite areas of New York City and replaced every car in shots with digital models. Raimi did not want it to feel entirely like animation, so none of the shots were 100% computer-generated.[133]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Music from and Inspired by Spider-Man and Spider-Man: Original Motion Picture Score\n\nDanny Elfman composed the music for the film. Its soundtrack combines traditional orchestration, ethnic percussion, and electronic elements. Its distinct ethnic characteristics are credited to Elfman, who spent a year in Africa studying its unique percussion.[134]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Original *Spider-Man* teaser poster, which was recalled from theaters following 9/11 (the World Trade Center is reflected in Spider-Man's eyes)\nAfter the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, Sony recalled a teaser poster which showed a close-up of Spider-Man's head with the World Trade Center towers reflected in his eyes.[135][136] The film's original teaser trailer, released that same year, featured a mini-film plot involving a group of bank robbers escaping in a Eurocopter AS355 Twin Squirrel helicopter, which gets caught from behind and propelled backward into what at first appears to be a net, then is shown to be a gigantic spider web spun between the World Trade Center towers.[137] This trailer was attached to the screenings of *Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within*, *Jurassic Park III*, *Planet of the Apes*, *Rush Hour 2*, and *American Pie 2*. According to Sony, the trailer did not contain any actual footage from the film itself.[138] Both the trailer and poster were removed after the events of the attacks, but can be found online.[139] Additionally, the home video release of *A Knight's Tale* would also have the *Spider-Man* trailer taken out.[140][141] New teaser posters featuring Spider-Man and the Green Goblin were unveiled in November 2001.[142] A month later, a new trailer deemed acceptable by Sony debuted on television during *Temptation Island* and in theaters with *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*.[143] Raimi later stated that the scene was, in fact, originally in the film but removed due to the recency of the attacks.[144] Another *Spider-Man* trailer premiered online on March 27, 2002, and in theaters with the releases of *Panic Room* and *The Rookie* just two days later on March 29.[145]\n\n\nTo promote the release of the film, Sony partnered with CKE Restaurants to release kids meal toys at Hardee's and Carl's Jr. restaurants. Beginning in April 2002, the locations offered customers three different *Spider-Man* collector's cups and patrons could purchase a Spider-Man figure to attach to their car radio antenna. A month later in May, \"Cool Combos for Kids\" would feature one of four different toys highlighting Spider-Man or his nemesis, the Green Goblin.[146] KFC would then follow suit, releasing their own *Spider-Man* kids meal toys at their locations in the United Kingdom.[147] Other promotional partners included Dr Pepper, Hershey's, Kellogg's, and Reebok.[148]\n\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nIn the U.S., it was rated \"PG-13\" for \"stylized violence and action\".[149] Before the film's British theatrical release in June 2002, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) gave the film a \"12\" certificate. Due to *Spider-Man*'s popularity with younger children, this prompted much controversy. The BBFC defended its decision, arguing that the film could have been given a \"15\". Despite this, North Norfolk and Breckland District Councils, in East Anglia, changed it to a \"PG\", and Tameside council, Manchester, denoted it a \"PG-12\". In late August, the BBFC relaxed its policy to \"12A\", leading Sony to re-release the film.[150][151]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Spider-Man* was released on DVD and VHS on November 1, 2002, in North America and Australia, and on November 25, 2002, in the UK.[152] Over 7 million DVD copies were sold on the first day of release.[153] The film would hold the record for having the highest single-day DVD sales until it was taken by *Finding Nemo* in 2003.[154] As of 2022, it has the single-day record for any live-action film.[155] In just a few days, the DVD release sold more than 11 million copies, beating *Monsters, Inc.* and setting records for any DVD release.[156] While the VHS release sold over 6.5 million copies, the DVD release went on to become one of the best-selling live-action DVD titles of all time with over 19.5 million copies being sold.[157][158] This two-disc DVD release comes in widescreen (1.85:1 aspect ratio) and fullscreen (specifically reframed 1.33:1 aspect ratio digitally mastered from the original source and specially reframed by the filmmakers themselves without gutting out portions of the frame using pan and scan) versions. Bonus features on the first disc include commentaries, character files, marketing champaign with music videos, TV spots and trailers, Weaving the Web Pop-Up Factoids, the Spider-Sense option that pops up an icon of Spider-Man while disabling subtitles and more. As for the second disc, the special features are an HBO special called The Making of Spider-Man, The Evolution of Spider-Man, outtakes, screen tests, an E! Network special called Spider-Mania and more. Both discs feature DVD-ROM features, such as a countdown to *Spider-Man 2*, record your own commentary and an Activision game.[159]\n\n\nThe film's American television rights (Fox, TBS/TNT) were sold for $60 million.[160] Related gross toy sales were $109 million.[160] Its American DVD revenue by July 2004 was $338.8 million.[160] Its American VHS revenue by July 2004 was $89.2 million.[160] As of 2006, the film has grossed a total revenue of $1.5 billion from box office and home video (sales and rentals), in addition a further $880 million from television (pay-per-view, broadcast TV and cable TV).[161]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was watched by 700,000 viewers on subscription television channel Sky Movies 1 in 2004, making it the year's ninth most-watched film on subscription television.[162]\n\n\nThe film made its Blu-ray debut in 2007 as part of the *Spider-Man Trilogy*.[163] Just three years later, it was released as a separate Blu-ray on November 16, 2010.[164] This was followed by another release on July 5, 2011.[165] *Spider-Man* was also included in the *Spider-Man Legacy Collection*, which includes 5 Spider-Man films in a 4K UHD Blu-ray collection, which was released on October 17, 2017.[166]\n\n\nRaimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy was released on Disney+ on April 21, 2023.[167]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Spider-Man* became the first film to pass the $100 million mark in a single weekend, even when adjusting for inflation, with its $114,844,116[168] gross establishing a new opening weekend record.[169][170] The gross surpassed the previous record holder's *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* $90.3 million opening; on this, Rick Lyman of *The New York Times* wrote \"while industry executives had expected a strong opening for the film because there was little competition in the marketplace and prerelease polling indicated intense interest from all age groups, no one predicted that *Spider-Man* would surpass the *Harry Potter* record.\"[170] Starting with *Twister* in 1996, the benefits of bowing in May had been first fully exploited with its $41 million opening weekend. Following comparable debuts of *Deep Impact* in 1998 and *The Mummy* in 1999, the frame was taken to the next level in 2001 with the release of *The Mummy Returns*. *Spider-Man* had not only made history for a summer starter film, but for weekends as well.[171] It surpassed *The Lost World: Jurassic Park* to have the largest May opening weekend. When the film was released, it was ranked number one at the box office, beating *The Scorpion King*.[172] The film also broke *X-Men*'s record for having the highest opening weekend for a superhero film.[169]\n\n\nThe film also set a record for crossing the $100 million milestone in three days, at the time being the fastest any film had reached the mark.[173] This opening weekend haul had an average of $31,769 per theater, which at the time, Box Office Mojo reported as being \"the highest per theater average ever for an ultra-wide release.\"[169] The film's three-day record was surpassed by *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* four years later.[174] The $114.8 million opening weekend was the highest at the North America box office film for a non-sequel, until it was surpassed eight years later by *Alice in Wonderland*.[175] *Spider-Man* would hold the record for having the highest-three day gross until it was surpassed by *Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith* in 2005.[176] Within four days, it had the biggest non-holiday Monday of all time with $11 million, increasing the total gross to $125.1 million and staying ahead of recent blockbusters, including *Charlie's Angels* and *Erin Brockovich*.[177]\n\n\nWith the film's release in the United States and Canada on May 3, 2002, on 7,500 screens at 3,615 theaters,[170] the film earned $39,406,872 on its opening day, averaging $10,901 per theater.[178] This was the highest opening day at the time until it was surpassed by its sequel *Spider-Man 2*'s $40.4 million haul in 2004.[179] For three years, the film would hold the record for having the highest Friday gross until 2005 when it was overtaken by *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*.[180] Upon its opening, it had the third-highest number of screenings of any film, behind *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* and *Mission: Impossible 2*.[169] *Spider-Man* also set an all-time record for the highest earnings in a single day with $43,622,264 on its second day of release,[169][178] a record later surpassed by *Shrek 2* in 2004.[181] On the Sunday during its opening weekend, the film earned an additional $31,814,980,[178] the highest gross a film took in on a Sunday, at the time.[169]\n\n\nThe film stayed at the top position in its second weekend ahead of *Unfaithful*, dropping only 38% and grossing another $71,417,527,[182] while averaging $19,755.89 per theater. At the time, this was the highest-grossing second weekend of any film.[182] During its second weekend, the film reached the $200 million mark on its ninth day of release, also a record at the time.[182] This made it the fastest film to cross the $200 million mark, surpassing *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*.[183] At the end of its second weekend, the film brought in a 10-day total of $223,040,031.[182] It quickly surpassed *Ice Age* to become the highest-grossing film of the year. *Spider-Man* had crossed over 149 spots on the top-grossing film chart, landing in 29th place between *Rush Hour 2* and *Mrs. Doubtfire* while excelling past the final tallies of other films, including *Batman Forever*, *Mission: Impossible 2* and *The Mummy Returns*.[182]\n\n\nThe film dropped to the second position in its third weekend, behind *Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones*, but still made $45,036,912, dropping only 37%, averaging $12,458 per theater, and bringing the 17-day tally to $285,573,668.[184] Its third weekend haul set the record for highest-grossing third weekend, which was first surpassed by *Avatar* (2009).[185] *Spider-Man* would beat another record that was previously held by *The Phantom Menace*, becoming the quickest film to hit $300 million in just 22 days.[186] It stayed at the second position in its fourth weekend, grossing $35,814,844 over the four-day Memorial Day frame, dropping only 21% while expanding to 3,876 theaters, averaging $9,240 over four days, and bringing the 25-day gross to $333,641,492.[187] Within 66 days, it was the fastest film to approach $400 million, tying its record with *Titanic*.[188] Both films held this record for two years before being surpassed by *Shrek 2*.[189]\n\n\nAt the box office, *Spider-Man* became 2002's highest-grossing film with $407,022,860 in the U.S. and Canada, defeating *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* and *Attack of the Clones*.[190] As of 2021, *Spider-Man* ranks as the 37th-highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S. and Canada, not adjusted for inflation. The film also grossed $418,002,176 from its international markets, bringing its worldwide total to $825,025,036[191] making it 2002's third-highest-grossing film behind *The Two Towers* and *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* and the 58th-highest-grossing film of all time, worldwide.[192] Additionally, it was the highest-grossing Sony film of all time, beating out *Men in Black*.[193][194] *Spider-Man* also dethroned *Batman*'s record for becoming the highest-grossing superhero film of all time.[193][195] The film sold an estimated 69,484,700 tickets in the US.[191] It held the record for most tickets sold by a comic book movie until *The Dark Knight* topped it in 2008. As of 2020, it is still the sixth highest grossing comic book movie of all time adjusted for inflation. Only *Avengers: Infinity War*, *The Dark Knight*, *Black Panther*, *The Avengers* and *Avengers: Endgame* have sold more tickets than *Spider-Man*. *Spider-Man* was the highest-grossing superhero origin film, a record it held for 15 years until it was surpassed by *Wonder Woman* (2017).[196][197] As of 2020, it is the 12th-highest-grossing superhero film, as well as the 12th-highest-grossing comic book adaptation in general.[198][199][200]\n\n\nInternationally, *Spider-Man* opened in 17 territories in its first week, earning a total of $13.3 million. It scored the second-highest opening in Iceland, Singapore and South Korea. Plus, Russia and Yugoslavia had the third best all time film opening.[201] *Spider-Man* would score the biggest opening in Switzerland with $1.4 million and 160,000 admissions from 106 screens, surpassing *The World Is Not Enough*. As for Germany, it had the strongest June opening and the third best debut of any movie, behind *Attack of the Clones* and *Ice Age*. Its opening screenings in France were a massive 10,645 admissions from 27 screens, beating out the French film *Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra*.[202] Additionally, it set the highest opening gross in Spain.[203] Meanwhile, *Spider-Man* would go on to unleash new opening records in the UK during the 2002 FIFA World Cup soccer game. The film made $13.9 million from 509 screens, making it the country's fifth biggest movie opening, trailing only behind *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, *The Phantom Menace*, *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* and *Attack of the Clones*. In addition, *Spider-Man* had the largest opening of any film in the UK with a BBFC certificate higher than a \"PG\" rating, staying ahead of *Independence Day* and *Hannibal*. Despite lunch matches, it still led the weekend box office to a bigger 110% week-to-week increase and a 130% year-on-year increase when *Pearl Harbor* led the chart during its third week.[204] It was the country's number one film for three weeks until it was displaced by *Minority Report*.[205] In India, the film was simultaneously released in English and three different languages across 250 screens, becoming the widest reach and return for a Hollywood title since *The Mummy Returns* in 2001. It was even Sony's first major release in the country since *Godzilla* in 1998.[206] The total number of international markets that generated grosses in excess of $10 million include Australia ($16.9 million), Brazil ($17.4 million), France, Algeria, Monaco, Morocco and Tunisia ($32.9 million), Germany ($30.7 million), Italy ($20.8 million), Japan ($56.2 million), Mexico ($31.2 million), South Korea ($16.98 million), Spain ($23.7 million), and the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($45.8 million).[207]\n\n\n*Spider-Man* became the highest-grossing superhero film of all time at the time of its release, both domestically and worldwide while surpassing *Batman*.[193] Its domestic gross was eventually topped by *The Dark Knight* (2008). Its worldwide gross was first surpassed by *Spider-Man 3* (2007).\n\n\nThe film also held the record as Sony's highest-grossing film domestically until 2018, when it was finally surpassed by *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* ($404.5 million).[208][209]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of 249 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Not only does *Spider-Man* provide a good dose of web-swinging fun, it also has a heart, thanks to the combined charms of director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire.\"[210] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[211] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[212]\n\n\nThe casting, mainly Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe and J. K. Simmons, is often cited as one of the film's high points. Eric Harrison, of the *Houston Chronicle*, was initially skeptical of the casting of Maguire, but after seeing the film he stated, \"it becomes difficult to imagine anyone else in the role.\"[213] *USA Today* critic Mike Clark believed the casting rivaled that of Christopher Reeve as 1978's *Superman*.[214] Owen Gleiberman, of *Entertainment Weekly*, had mixed feelings about the casting, particularly Tobey Maguire. \"Maguire, winning as he is, never quite gets the chance to bring the two sides of Spidey—the boy and the man, the romantic and the avenger—together.\"[215] *The Hollywood Reporter*'s Kirk Honeycutt thought: \"the filmmakers' imaginations work in overdrive from the clever design of the cobwebby opening credits and Spider-Man and M.J.'s upside down kiss—after one of his many rescues of her—to a finale that leaves character relationships open ended for future adventures.\"[216]\n\n\n*LA Weekly*'s Manohla Dargis wrote, \"It isn't that Spider-Man is inherently unsuited for live-action translation; it's just that he's not particularly interesting or, well, animated.\"[217] Giving it two and a half stars out of four, Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* felt that the film lacked a decent action element: \"Consider the scene where Spider-Man is given a cruel choice between saving Mary Jane or a cable car full of school kids. He tries to save both, so that everyone dangles from webbing that seems about to pull loose. The visuals here could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved, but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea.\"[218]\nStylistically, there was heavy criticism of the Green Goblin's costume, which led *IGN*'s Richard George to comment years later: \"We're not saying the comic book costume is exactly thrilling, but the Goblin armor (the helmet in particular) from *Spider-Man* is almost comically bad... Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression.\"[219]\n\n\n*Entertainment Weekly* put \"the kiss in *Spider-Man*\" on its end-of-the-decade \"best-of\" list, saying: \"There's a fine line between romantic and corny. And the rain-soaked smooch between Spider-Man and Mary Jane from 2002 tap-dances right on that line. The reason it works? Even if she suspects he's Peter Parker, she doesn't try to find out. And that's sexy.\"[220]\n\n\n*Empire* magazine ranked *Spider-Man* 437 in its *500 Greatest Movies of All Time* list in 2008.[221]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by the 2002–2007 Spider-Man film series\n\nThe film won several awards ranging from Teen Choice Awards to the Saturn Awards, and was also nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound (Kevin O'Connell, Greg P. Russell and Ed Novick), but lost to *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* and *Chicago*, respectively.[222][223] While only Danny Elfman brought home a Saturn Award, Raimi, Maguire, and Dunst were all nominated for their respective positions. It also took home the People's Choice Award for \"Favorite Motion Picture.\"[223] The film was nominated for Favorite Movie at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, but lost to *Austin Powers in Goldmember*.\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\n### Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3\n\nTwo sequels to *Spider-Man* were produced and directed by Sam Raimi: *Spider-Man 2* was released on June 30, 2004, while *Spider-Man 3* was released on May 4, 2007.\n\n\n\n### Animated television series[edit]\n\n\nA CGI/spin-off animated series, *Spider-Man: The New Animated Series*, ran on July to September 2003; it was intended to be the continuation of the first film, and was an alternate sequel to the film different from the events of the later sequels.[224]\n\n\n\n## Video game[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spider-Man (2002 video game)\n\nA video game based on the film of the same name was released.[225] The game was developed by Treyarch (only for the home consoles) and published by Activision, and released in 2002 for Game Boy Advance, GameCube, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. The game has many scenes and villains that did not appear in the film. It was followed by *Spider-Man 2* two years later to promote the release of the second film. In 2007, to promote the release of the third film, *Spider-Man 3* was released. Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe were the only actors who reprised their roles from the film. *Spider-Man: Friend or Foe* was released in 2007, the games borrow the film characters, and it serves as non-canon plot of the film series.[226]\n\n\nThe critical reviews for the game were positive. By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of *Spider-Man* had sold 2.1 million copies and earned $74 million in the United States. *Next Generation* ranked it as the 15th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of *Spider-Man* console games released in the 2000s reached 6 million units in the United States by July 2006.[227]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Spider-Man\". *AFI Catalog of Feature Films*.
