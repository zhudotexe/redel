Established in 1861, MIT has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and science.\n\n\nFounded in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. MIT is one of three private land grant universities in the United States, the others being Cornell University and Tuskegee University. The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River, and encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes.\n\n\nAs of October 2023[update], 101 Nobel laureates,[10] 26 Turing Award winners, and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT as alumni, faculty members, or researchers.[11] In addition, 58 National Medal of Science recipients, 29 National Medals of Technology and Innovation recipients, 50 MacArthur Fellows,[12] 83 Marshall Scholars,[13] 41 astronauts,[14] 16 Chief Scientists of the US Air Force, and various heads of states have been affiliated with MIT. The institute also has a strong entrepreneurial culture and MIT alumni have founded or co-founded many notable companies.[15][16] MIT is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU).[17]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n### Foundation and vision[edit]\n\n\n> \n> ... a school of industrial science aiding the advancement, development and practical application of science in connection with arts, agriculture, manufactures, and commerce.(Charter,1861)\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n![](image)Stereographic card showing an MIT mechanical drafting studio, 19th century (photo by E. L. Allen, left/right inverted)\n![](image)Original Rogers Building, Back Bay, Boston, c. 1901\nIn 1859, a proposal was submitted to the Massachusetts General Court to use newly filled lands in Back Bay, Boston for a \"Conservatory of Art and Science,\" but the proposal failed.[19][20] A charter for the incorporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed by William Barton Rogers, was signed by John Albion Andrew, the governor of Massachusetts, on April 10, 1861.[21]\n\n\nRogers, a former student of the College of William and Mary and professor at the University of Virginia,[22] wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances.[23][24] He did not wish to found a professional school, but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education,[25] proposing that:\n\n\n\n\n> The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.[26]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Rogers Plan reflected the German research university model, emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research, as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### Early developments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1905 map of MIT's Boston campus\n![](image)The then-new Cambridge campus, completed in 1916. Harvard Bridge, named after John Harvard, the founder of Harvard University, is in the foreground, connecting Boston to Cambridge.\nTwo days after MIT was chartered, the first battle of the Civil War broke out. After a long delay through the war years, MIT's first classes were held in the Mercantile Building in Boston in 1865.[29] The new institute was founded as part of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act to fund institutions \"to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes\" and was a land-grant school.[30][31] In 1863 under the same act, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts founded the Massachusetts Agricultural College, which developed as the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In 1866, the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the Back Bay.[32]\n\n\nMIT was informally called \"Boston Tech\".[32] The institute adopted the European polytechnic university model and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date.[27] Despite chronic financial problems, the institute saw growth in the last two decades of the 19th century under President Francis Amasa Walker.[33] Programs in electrical, chemical, marine, and sanitary engineering were introduced,[34][35] new buildings were built, and the size of the student body increased to more than one thousand.[33]\n\n\nThe curriculum drifted to a vocational emphasis, with less focus on theoretical science.[36] The fledgling school still suffered from chronic financial shortages which diverted the attention of the MIT leadership. During these \"Boston Tech\" years, MIT faculty and alumni rebuffed Harvard University president (and former MIT faculty) Charles W. Eliot's repeated attempts to merge MIT with Harvard College's Lawrence Scientific School.[37] There would be at least six attempts to absorb MIT into Harvard.[38] In its cramped Back Bay location, MIT could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities, driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding. Eventually, the MIT Corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with Harvard, over the vehement objections of MIT faculty, students, and alumni.[38] However, a 1917 decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court effectively put an end to the merger scheme.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Plaque in Building 6 honoring George Eastman, founder of Eastman Kodak, who was revealed as the anonymous \"Mr. Smith\" who helped maintain MIT's independence\nIn 1916, the MIT administration and the MIT charter crossed the Charles River on the ceremonial barge *Bucentaur* built for the occasion,[39][40] to signify MIT's move to a spacious new campus largely consisting of filled land on a one mi-long (1.6 km) tract along the Cambridge side of the Charles River.[41][42] The neoclassical \"New Technology\" campus was designed by William W. Bosworth[43] and had been funded largely by anonymous donations from a mysterious \"Mr. Smith\", starting in 1912. In January 1920, the donor was revealed to be the industrialist George Eastman of Rochester, New York, who had invented methods of film production and processing, and founded Eastman Kodak. Between 1912 and 1920, Eastman donated $20 million ($236.6 million in 2015 dollars) in cash and Kodak stock to MIT.[44]\n\n\n\n### Curricular reforms[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1930s, President Karl Taylor Compton and Vice-President (effectively Provost) Vannevar Bush emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios.[45] The Compton reforms \"renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering\".[46] Unlike Ivy League schools, MIT catered more to middle-class families, and depended more on tuition than on endowments or grants for its funding.[47] The school was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934.[48]\n\n\nStill, as late as 1949, the Lewis Committee lamented in its report on the state of education at MIT that \"the Institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school\", a \"partly unjustified\" perception the committee sought to change. The report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum, recommended offering a broader education, and warned against letting engineering and government-sponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities.[49][50] The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences and the MIT Sloan School of Management were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful Schools of Science and Engineering. Previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics, management, political science, and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs.[51][52] The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences continued to develop under the successive terms of the more humanistically oriented presidents Howard W. Johnson and Jerome Wiesner between 1966 and 1980.[53]\n\n\n\n### Defense research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ROTC students celebrate Veterans Day at MIT in 2019.\nMIT's involvement in military science surged during World War II. In 1941, Vannevar Bush was appointed head of the federal Office of Scientific Research and Development and directed funding to only a select group of universities, including MIT.[54] Engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at MIT's Radiation Laboratory, established in 1940 to assist the British military in developing microwave radar. The work done there significantly affected both the war and subsequent research in the area.[55] Other defense projects included gyroscope-based and other complex control systems for gunsight, bombsight, and inertial navigation under Charles Stark Draper's Instrumentation Laboratory;[56][57] the development of a digital computer for flight simulations under Project Whirlwind;[58] and high-speed and high-altitude photography under Harold Edgerton.[59][60] By the end of the war, MIT became the nation's largest wartime R&D contractor (attracting some criticism of Bush),[54] employing nearly 4000 in the Radiation Laboratory alone[55] and receiving in excess of $100 million ($1.2 billion in 2015 dollars) before 1946.[46] Work on defense projects continued even after then. Post-war government-sponsored research at MIT included SAGE and guidance systems for ballistic missiles and Project Apollo.[61]\n\n\n\n> \n> ... a special type of educational institution which can be defined as a university polarized around science, engineering, and the arts. We might call it a university limited in its objectives but unlimited in the breadth and the thoroughness with which it pursues these objectives.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—MIT president James Rhyne Killian\n\nThese activities affected MIT profoundly. A 1949 report noted the lack of \"any great slackening in the pace of life at the Institute\" to match the return to peacetime, remembering the \"academic tranquility of the prewar years\", though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities.[63] The faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of Karl Taylor Compton, president of MIT between 1930 and 1948; James Rhyne Killian, president from 1948 to 1957; and Julius Adams Stratton, chancellor from 1952 to 1957, whose institution-building strategies shaped the expanding university. By the 1950s, MIT no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades, and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons, philanthropic foundations and the federal government.[64]\n\n\nIn late 1960s and early 1970s, student and faculty activists protested against the Vietnam War and MIT's defense research.[65][66] In this period MIT's various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam as well as guidance systems for nuclear missiles.[67] The Union of Concerned Scientists was founded on March 4, 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems.[68] MIT ultimately divested itself from the Instrumentation Laboratory and moved all classified research off-campus to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory facility in 1973 in response to the protests.[69][70] The student body, faculty, and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities.[65] Johnson was seen to be highly successful in leading his institution to \"greater strength and unity\" after these times of turmoil.[71] However six MIT students were sentenced to prison terms at this time and some former student leaders, such as Michael Albert and George Katsiaficas, are still indignant about MIT's role in military research and its suppression of these protests.[72] (Richard Leacock's film, *November Actions*, records some of these tumultuous events.[73])\n\n\nIn the 1980s, there was more controversy at MIT over its involvement in SDI (space weaponry) and CBW (chemical and biological warfare) research.[74] More recently, MIT's research for the military has included work on robots, drones and 'battle suits'.[75]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The MIT Media Lab houses researchers developing novel uses of computer technology and shown here is the 1985 building, designed by I.M. Pei, with an extension (right of photo) designed by Fumihiko Maki opened in March 2010.\nMIT has kept pace with and helped to advance the digital age. In addition to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies,[76][77] students, staff, and faculty members at Project MAC, the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and the Tech Model Railroad Club wrote some of the earliest interactive computer video games like *Spacewar!* and created much of modern hacker slang and culture.[78] Several major computer-related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s: Richard Stallman's GNU Project and the subsequent Free Software Foundation were founded in the mid-1980s at the AI Lab; the MIT Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology;[79] the World Wide Web Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee;[80] the OpenCourseWare project has made course materials for over 2,000 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002;[81] and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005.[82]\n\n\nMIT was named a sea-grant college in 1976 to support its programs in oceanography and marine sciences and was named a space-grant college in 1989 to support its aeronautics and astronautics programs.[83][84] Despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century, MIT launched several successful development campaigns to significantly expand the campus: new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus; the Tang Center for Management Education; several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into biology, brain and cognitive sciences, genomics, biotechnology, and cancer research; and a number of new \"backlot\" buildings on Vassar Street including the Stata Center.[85] Construction on campus in the 2000s included expansions of the Media Lab, the Sloan School's eastern campus, and graduate residences in the northwest.[86][87] In 2006, President Hockfield launched the MIT Energy Research Council to investigate the interdisciplinary challenges posed by increasing global energy consumption.[88]\n\n\nIn 2001, inspired by the open source and open access movements,[89] MIT launched OpenCourseWare to make the lecture notes, problem sets, syllabi, exams, and lectures from the great majority of its courses available online for no charge, though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed.[90] While the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high,[91] OCW expanded in 2005 to include other universities as a part of the OpenCourseWare Consortium, which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages.[92] In 2011, MIT announced it would offer formal certification (but not credits or degrees) to online participants completing coursework in its \"MITx\" program, for a modest fee.[93] The \"edX\" online platform supporting MITx was initially developed in partnership with Harvard and its analogous \"Harvardx\" initiative. The courseware platform is open source, and other universities have already joined and added their own course content.[94] In March 2009 the MIT faculty adopted an open-access policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online.[95]\n\n\nMIT has its own police force. Three days after the Boston Marathon bombing of April 2013, MIT Police patrol officer Sean Collier was fatally shot by the suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, setting off a violent manhunt that shut down the campus and much of the Boston metropolitan area for a day.[96] One week later, Collier's memorial service was attended by more than 10,000 people, in a ceremony hosted by the MIT community with thousands of police officers from the New England region and Canada.[97][98][99] On November 25, 2013, MIT announced the creation of the Collier Medal, to be awarded annually to \"an individual or group that embodies the character and qualities that Officer Collier exhibited as a member of the MIT community and in all aspects of his life\". The announcement further stated that \"Future recipients of the award will include those whose contributions exceed the boundaries of their profession, those who have contributed to building bridges across the community, and those who consistently and selflessly perform acts of kindness\".[100][101][102]\n\n\nIn September 2017, the school announced the creation of an artificial intelligence research lab called the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. IBM will spend $240 million over the next decade, and the lab will be staffed by MIT and IBM scientists.[103] In October 2018 MIT announced that it would open a new Schwarzman College of Computing dedicated to the study of artificial intelligence, named after lead donor and The Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman. The focus of the new college is to study not just AI, but interdisciplinary AI education, and how AI can be used in fields as diverse as history and biology. The cost of buildings and new faculty for the new college is expected to be $1 billion upon completion.[104]\n\n\nThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from California Institute of Technology, MIT, and industrial contractors, and funded by the National Science Foundation. It was designed to open the field of gravitational-wave astronomy through the detection of gravitational waves predicted by general relativity.[105] Gravitational waves were detected for the first time by the LIGO detector in 2015. For contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves, two Caltech physicists, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish, and MIT physicist Rainer Weiss won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2017.[106] Weiss, who is also an MIT graduate, designed the laser interferometric technique, which served as the essential blueprint for the LIGO.[107]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n![](image)The central and eastern sections of MIT's campus as seen from above Massachusetts Avenue and the Charles River. Left of center is the Great Dome overlooking Killian Court, with Kendall Square to the upper right.\n![](image)MIT's Building 10 and Great Dome overlooking Killian Court\nMIT's 166-acre (67.2 ha) campus in the city of Cambridge spans approximately a mile along the north side of the Charles River basin.[6] The campus is divided roughly in half by Massachusetts Avenue, with most dormitories and student life facilities to the west and most academic buildings to the east. The bridge closest to MIT is the Harvard Bridge, which is known for being marked off in a non-standard unit of length – the smoot.[108][109]\n\n\nThe Kendall/MIT MBTA Red Line station is located on the northeastern edge of the campus, in Kendall Square. The Cambridge neighborhoods surrounding MIT are a mixture of high tech companies occupying both modern office and rehabilitated industrial buildings, as well as socio-economically diverse residential neighborhoods.[110][111] In early 2016, MIT presented its updated Kendall Square Initiative to the City of Cambridge, with plans for mixed-use educational, retail, residential, startup incubator, and office space in a dense high-rise transit-oriented development plan. The MIT Museum has moved immediately adjacent to a Kendall Square subway entrance, joining the List Visual Arts Center on the eastern end of the campus.[112]\n\n\nEach building at MIT has a number (possibly preceded by a *W*, *N*, *E*, or *NW*) designation, and most have a name as well. Typically, academic and office buildings are referred to primarily by number while residence halls are referred to by name. The organization of building numbers roughly corresponds to the order in which the buildings were built and their location relative (north, west, and east) to the original center cluster of Maclaurin buildings.[113] Many of the buildings are connected above ground as well as through an extensive network of tunnels, providing protection from the Cambridge weather as well as a venue for roof and tunnel hacking.[114][115]\n\n\nMIT's on-campus nuclear reactor[116] is one of the most powerful university-based nuclear reactors in the United States. The prominence of the reactor's containment building in a densely populated area has been controversial,[117] but MIT maintains that it is well-secured.[118] In 1999 Bill Gates donated US$20 million to MIT for the construction of a computer laboratory named the \"William H. Gates Building\", and designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[119]\n\n\nMIT Nano, also known as Building 12, is an interdisciplinary facility for nanoscale research. Its 100,000 sq ft (9,300 m2) cleanroom and research space, visible through expansive glass facades, is the largest research facility of its kind in the nation.[120] With a cost of US$400 million, it is also one of the costliest buildings on campus. The facility also provides state-of-the-art nanoimaging capabilities with vibration damped imaging and metrology suites sitting atop a 5×10~~^~~6 lb (2,300,000 kg) slab of concrete underground.[121]\n\n\nOther notable campus facilities include a pressurized wind tunnel for testing aerodynamic research, a towing tank for testing ship and ocean structure designs, and previously Alcator C-Mod, which was the largest fusion device operated by any university.[122][123] MIT's campus-wide wireless network was completed in the fall of 2005 and consists of nearly 3,000 access points covering 9.4×10~~^~~6 sq ft (870,000 m2) of campus.[124]\n\n\nIn 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT for violating the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act with regard to its hazardous waste storage and disposal procedures.[125] MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects.[126] In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.[127]\n\n\nMIT has substantial commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge on which it pays property taxes, plus an additional voluntary payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) on academic buildings which are legally tax-exempt. As of 2017[update], it is the largest taxpayer in the city, contributing approximately 14% of the city's annual revenues.[128] Holdings include Technology Square, parts of Kendall Square, and many properties in Cambridgeport and Area 4 neighboring the educational buildings.[129] The land is held for investment purposes and potential long-term expansion.[130]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Stata Center houses CSAIL, LIDS, and the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy.\nMIT's School of Architecture, now the School of Architecture and Planning, was the first formal architecture program in the United States,[131] and it has a history of commissioning progressive buildings.[132][133] The first buildings constructed on the Cambridge campus, completed in 1916, are sometimes called the \"Maclaurin buildings\" after Institute president Richard Maclaurin who oversaw their construction. Designed by William Welles Bosworth, these imposing buildings were built of reinforced concrete, a first for a non-industrial – much less university – building in the US.[134] Bosworth's design was influenced by the City Beautiful Movement of the early 1900s[134] and features the Pantheon-esque Great Dome housing the Barker Engineering Library. The Great Dome overlooks Killian Court, where graduation ceremonies are held each year. The friezes of the limestone-clad buildings around Killian Court are engraved with the names of important scientists and philosophers.[a] The spacious Building 7 atrium at 77 Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the entrance to the Infinite Corridor and the rest of the campus.[111]\n\n\nAlvar Aalto's Baker House (1947), Eero Saarinen's MIT Chapel and Kresge Auditorium (1955), and I.M. Pei's Green, Dreyfus, Landau, and Wiesner buildings represent high forms of post-war modernist architecture.[137][138][139] More recent buildings like Frank Gehry's Stata Center (2004), Steven Holl's Simmons Hall (2002), Charles Correa's Building 46 (2005), and Fumihiko Maki's Media Lab Extension (2009) stand out among the Boston area's classical architecture and serve as examples of contemporary campus \"starchitecture\".[132][140] These buildings have not always been well received;[141][142] in 2010, *The Princeton Review* included MIT in a list of twenty schools whose campuses are \"tiny, unsightly, or both\".[143]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Housing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nSee also: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology fraternities, sororities, and ILGs\n\n![](image)The Simmons Hall undergrad dormitory was completed in 2002.\nUndergraduates are guaranteed four-year housing in one of MIT's 11 undergraduate dormitories.[144] Those living on campus can receive support and mentoring from live-in graduate student tutors, resident advisors, and faculty housemasters.[145] Because housing assignments are made based on the preferences of the students themselves, diverse social atmospheres can be sustained in different living groups; for example, according to the *Yale Daily News* staff's *The Insider's Guide to the Colleges, 2010*, \"The split between East Campus and West Campus is a significant characteristic of MIT. East Campus has gained a reputation as a thriving counterculture.\"[146] MIT also has 5 dormitories for single graduate students and 2 apartment buildings on campus for married student families.[147]\n\n\nMIT has an active Greek and co-op housing system, including thirty-six fraternities, sororities, and independent living groups (FSILGs).[148] As of 2015[update], 98% of all undergraduates lived in MIT-affiliated housing; 54% of the men participated in fraternities and 20% of the women were involved in sororities.[149] Most FSILGs are located across the river in Back Bay near where MIT was founded, and there is also a cluster of fraternities on MIT's West Campus that face the Charles River Basin.[150] After the 1997 alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger, a new pledge at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT required all freshmen to live in the dormitory system starting in 2002.[151] Because FSILGs had previously housed as many as 300 freshmen off-campus, the new policy could not be implemented until Simmons Hall opened in that year.[152]\n\n\nIn 2013–2014, MIT abruptly closed and then demolished undergrad dorm Bexley Hall, citing extensive water damage that made repairs infeasible. In 2017, MIT shut down Senior House after a century of service as an undergrad dorm. That year, MIT administrators released data showing just 60% of Senior House residents had graduated in four years. Campus-wide, the four-year graduation rate is 84% (the cumulative graduation rate is significantly higher).[153]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lobby 7 at 77 Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the main entrance to campus.\nMIT is chartered as a non-profit organization and is owned and governed by a privately appointed board of trustees known as the MIT Corporation.[154] The current board consists of 43 members elected to five-year terms,[155] 25 life members who vote until their 75th birthday,[156] 3 elected officers (President, Treasurer, and Secretary),[157] and 4 *ex officio* members (the president of the alumni association, the Governor of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Secretary of Education, and the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court).[158][159] The board is chaired by Diane Greene SM ’78, co-founder and former CEO of VMware and former CEO of Google Cloud.[160] The Corporation approves the budget, new programs, degrees and faculty appointments, and elects the President to serve as the chief executive officer of the university and preside over the Institute's faculty.[111][161] MIT's endowment and other financial assets are managed through a subsidiary called MIT Investment Management Company (MITIMCo).[162] Valued at $16.4 billion in 2018, MIT's endowment was then the sixth-largest among American colleges and universities.[163]\n\n\nMIT has five schools (Science, Engineering, Architecture and Planning, Management, and Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences) and one college (Schwarzman College of Computing), but no schools of law or medicine.[164][b][166] While faculty committees assert substantial control over many areas of MIT's curriculum, research, student life, and administrative affairs,[167] the chair of each of MIT's 32 academic departments reports to the dean of that department's school, who in turn reports to the Provost under the President.[168] The current president is Sally Kornbluth, a cell biologist and former provost at Duke University. She became MIT's 18th president in January 2023.[169] She was preceded by L. Rafael Reif, who had served as provost under President Susan Hockfield, the first woman to hold the post.[170][171]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFall first-time freshman admission statistics\n|  | 2022[172] | 2021[173] | 2020[174] | 2019[175] | 2018[176] | 2017[177] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Applicants\n | 33,767 | 33,240 | 20,075 | 21,312 | 21,706 | 20,247\n |\n| Admits\n | 1,337 | 1,365 | 1,457 | 1,427 | 1,464 | 1,452\n |\n| Enrolls\n | 1,136 | 1,177 | 1,070 | 1,102 | 1,114 | 1,097\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 4.0% | 4.1% | 7.3% | 6.7% | 6.7% | 7.2%\n |\n| Yield rate\n | 85.0% | 86.2% | 73.4% | 77.2% | 76.1% | 75.5%\n |\n| SAT composite\\*\n | 1520⁠–1570(78%†) | 1510⁠–1570(70%†) | 1510⁠–1570(77%†) | 1510⁠–1570(76%†) | 1500⁠–1570(75%†) | 1490⁠–1570(72%†) |\n| ACT composite\\*\n | 35–36(32%†) | 34–36(34%†) | 34–36(42%†) | 34–36(45%†) | 34–36(48%†) | 33–35(55%†) |\n| \\* middle 50% range † percentage of first-time freshmen who chose to submit\n |\n\n\nMIT is a large, highly residential, research university with a majority of enrollments in graduate and professional programs.[178] The university has been accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges since 1929.[179] MIT operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall semester beginning after Labor Day and ending in mid-December, a 4-week \"Independent Activities Period\" in the month of January, and the spring semester commencing in early February and ceasing in late May.[180]\n\n\nMIT students refer to both their majors and classes using numbers or acronyms alone.[181] Departments and their corresponding majors are numbered in the approximate order of their foundation; for example, Civil and Environmental Engineering is Course 1, while Linguistics and Philosophy is Course 24.[182] Students majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), the most popular department, collectively identify themselves as \"Course 6\". MIT students use a combination of the department's course number and the number assigned to the class to identify their subjects; for instance, the introductory calculus-based classical mechanics course is simply \"8.01\" (pronounced *eight-oh-one*) at MIT.[183][c]\n\n\n\n### Undergraduate program[edit]\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment in MIT (2017–2023)\n| Academic Year\n | Undergraduates\n | Graduate\n | Total Enrollment\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017–2018[177] | 4,547 | 6,919 | 11,466\n |\n| 2018–2019[176] | 4,602 | 6,972 | 11,574\n |\n| 2019–2020[175] | 4,530 | 6,990 | 11,520\n |\n| 2020–2021[174] | 4,361 | 6,893 | 11,254\n |\n| 2021–2022[173] | 4,638 | 7,296 | 11,934\n |\n| 2022–2023[172] | 4,657 | 7,201 | 11,858\n |\n\n\nThe four-year, full-time undergraduate program maintains a balance between professional majors and those in the arts and sciences. In 2010, it was dubbed \"most selective\" by *U.S. News*,[186] admitting few transfer students[178] and 4.1% of its applicants in the 2020–2021 admissions cycle.[187] It is need-blind for both domestic and international applicants.[188] MIT offers 44 undergraduate degrees across its five schools.[189] In the 2017–2018 academic year, 1,045 Bachelor of Science degrees (abbreviated \"SB\") were granted, the only type of undergraduate degree MIT now awards.[*needs update*][190][191] In the 2011 fall term, among students who had designated a major, the School of Engineering was the most popular division, enrolling 63% of students in its 19 degree programs, followed by the School of Science (29%), School of Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences (3.7%), Sloan School of Management (3.3%), and School of Architecture and Planning (2%).[*needs update*] The largest undergraduate degree programs were in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Course 6–2), Computer Science and Engineering (Course 6–3), Mechanical Engineering (Course 2), Physics (Course 8), and Mathematics (Course 18).[184]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Infinite Corridor is the primary passageway through campus.\n\n\nAll undergraduates are required to complete a core curriculum called the General Institute Requirements (GIRs).[192] The Science Requirement, generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors, comprises two semesters of physics, two semesters of calculus, one semester of chemistry, and one semester of biology. There is a Laboratory Requirement, usually satisfied by an appropriate class in a course major. The Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Requirement consists of eight semesters of classes in the humanities, arts, and social sciences, including at least one semester from each division as well as the courses required for a designated concentration in a HASS division. Under the Communication Requirement, two of the HASS classes, plus two of the classes taken in the designated major must be \"communication-intensive\",[193] including \"substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation\".[194] Finally, all students are required to complete a swimming test;[195] non-varsity athletes must also take four quarters of physical education classes.[192]\n\n\nMost classes rely on a combination of lectures, recitations led by associate professors or graduate students, weekly problem sets (\"p-sets\"), and periodic quizzes or tests. While the pace and difficulty of MIT coursework has been compared to \"drinking from a fire hose\",[196][197][198] the freshmen retention rate at MIT is similar to other research universities.[186] The \"pass/no-record\" grading system relieves some pressure for first-year undergraduates. For each class taken in the fall term, freshmen transcripts will either report only that the class was passed, or otherwise not have any record of it. In the spring term, passing grades (A, B, C) appear on the transcript while non-passing grades are again not recorded.[199] (Grading had previously been \"pass/no record\" all freshman year, but was amended for the Class of 2006 to prevent students from gaming the system by completing required major classes in their freshman year.[200]) Also, freshmen may choose to join alternative learning communities, such as Experimental Study Group, Concourse, or Terrascope.[199]\n\n\nIn 1969, Margaret MacVicar founded the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) to enable undergraduates to collaborate directly with faculty members and researchers. Students join or initiate research projects (\"UROPs\") for academic credit, pay, or on a volunteer basis through postings on the UROP website or by contacting faculty members directly.[201] A substantial majority of undergraduates participate.[202][203] Students often become published, file patent applications, and/or launch start-up companies based upon their experience in UROPs.[204][205]\n\n\nIn 1970, the then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder, published *The Hidden Curriculum,* arguing that education at MIT was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education. The successful student, according to Snyder, was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms. For example, organized student groups had compiled \"course bibles\"—collections of problem-set and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references. This sort of gamesmanship, Snyder argued, hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest.[206][207]\n\n\n\n### Graduate program[edit]\n\n\nMIT's graduate program has high coexistence with the undergraduate program, and many courses are taken by qualified students at both levels. MIT offers a comprehensive doctoral program with degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields as well as professional degrees, including the Master of Business Administration (MBA).[178] The Institute offers graduate programs leading to academic degrees such as the Master of Science (which is abbreviated as MS at MIT), various Engineer's Degrees, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), and Doctor of Science (DSc) and interdisciplinary graduate programs such as the MD-PhD (with Harvard Medical School) and a joint program in oceanography with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.[208][209][210][211]\n\n\nAdmission to graduate programs is decentralized; applicants apply directly to the department or degree program. More than 90% of doctoral students are supported by fellowships, research assistantships (RAs), or teaching assistantships (TAs).[212]\n\n\n\n### MIT Bootcamps[edit]\n\n\nMIT Bootcamps are intense week-long innovation and leadership programs that challenge participants to develop a venture in a week.[213] Each Bootcamp centers around a particular topic, specific to an industry, leadership skill set, or emerging technology. Cohorts are organized into small teams who work on an entrepreneurial project together, in addition to individual learning and team coaching. The program includes a series of online seminars with MIT faculty, practitioners, and industry experts, innovation workshops with bootcamp instructors focused on putting the theory participants have learned into practice, coaching sessions, and informal office hours for learners to exchange ideas freely. Bootcampers are tasked with weekly \"deliverables\", which are key elements of a business plan, to help guide the group through the decision-making process involved in building an enterprise. The experience culminates in a final pitch session, judged by a panel of experts.[214]\n\n\nMIT Bootcamp instructors include Eric von Hippel, Sanjay Sarma, Erdin Beshimov, and Bill Aulet.[215] MIT Bootcamps were founded by Erdin Beshimov.[216][214][217]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[218] | 1 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[219] | 2

places among the top five in many overall rankings of universities (see table right) and rankings based on students' revealed preferences.[226][227][228] For several years, *U.S. News & World Report*, the QS World University Rankings, and the Academic Ranking of World Universities have ranked MIT's School of Engineering first, as did the 1995 National Research Council report.[229] In the same lists, MIT's strongest showings apart from in engineering are in computer science, the natural sciences, business, architecture, economics, linguistics, mathematics, and, to a lesser extent, political science and philosophy.[230]\n\n\nTimes Higher Education has recognized MIT as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, Oxford, and Stanford.[231] In 2019, it was ranked #3 among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[232] In 2017, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings also rated MIT the #2 university for arts and humanities.[233][234] MIT was ranked #7 in 2015 and #6 in 2017 of the Nature Index Annual Tables, which measure the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[235][236][237] Georgetown University researchers ranked MIT #3 in the US for 20-year return on investment.[238]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Collaborations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eero Saarinen's Kresge Auditorium (1955) is a classic example of post-war architecture.\nThe university historically pioneered research and training collaborations between academia, industry and government.[239][240] In 1946, President Compton, Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot, and Massachusetts Investor Trust chairman Merrill Grisswold founded American Research and Development Corporation, the first American venture-capital firm.[241][242] In 1948, Compton established the MIT Industrial Liaison Program.[243] Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer-funded research and technology to international – especially Japanese – firms that were competing with struggling American businesses.[244][245] On the other hand, MIT's extensive collaboration with the federal government on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940.[d] MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy.[247][248]\n\n\nThe US Justice Department began an investigation in 1989, and in 1991 filed an antitrust suit against MIT, the eight Ivy League colleges, and eleven other institutions for allegedly engaging in price-fixing during their annual \"Overlap Meetings\", which were held to prevent bidding wars over promising prospective students from consuming funds for need-based scholarships.[249][250] While the Ivy League institutions settled,[251] MIT contested the charges, arguing that the practice was not anti-competitive because it ensured the availability of aid for the greatest number of students.[252][253] MIT ultimately prevailed when the Justice Department dropped the case in 1994.[254][255]\n\n\n\n![](image)Walker Memorial is a monument to MIT's fourth president, Francis Amasa Walker.\n![](image)MIT main campus seen from Vassar Street, as The Great Dome is visible in the distance and the Stata Center is at right\nMIT's proximity[e] to Harvard University (\"the other school up the river\") has led to a substantial number of research collaborations such as the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and the Broad Institute.[256] In addition, students at the two schools can cross-register for credits toward their own school's degrees without any additional fees.[256] A cross-registration program between MIT and Wellesley College has also existed since 1969, and in 2002 the Cambridge–MIT Institute launched an undergraduate exchange program between MIT and the University of Cambridge.[256] MIT also has a long-term partnership with Imperial College London, for both student exchanges and research collaboration.[257][258] More modest cross-registration programs have been established with Boston University, Brandeis University, Tufts University, Massachusetts College of Art, and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.[256]\n\n\nMIT maintains substantial research and faculty ties with independent research organizations in the Boston area, such as the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.[211] Ongoing international research and educational collaborations include the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS Institute), Singapore-MIT Alliance, MIT-Politecnico di Milano,[256][259] MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, and projects in other countries through the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) program.[256][260]\n\n\nThe mass-market magazine *Technology Review* is published by MIT through a subsidiary company, as is a special edition that also serves as an alumni magazine.[261][262] The MIT Press is a major university press, publishing over 200 books and 30 journals annually, emphasizing science and technology as well as arts, architecture, new media, current events, and social issues.[263]\n\n\nMIT Microphotonics Center and PhotonDelta founded the global roadmap for integrated photonics: Integrated Photonics Systems Roadmap – International (IPSR-I). The first edition has been published in 2020. The roadmap is an amalgamation of two previously independent roadmaps: the IPSR roadmap of MIT Microphotonics Center and AIM Photonics in the United States, and the WTMF (World Technology Mapping Forum) of PhotonDelta in Europe.[264]\n\n\n\n### Libraries, collections, and museums[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Libraries and Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology § Artwork\n\nThe MIT library system consists of five subject libraries: Barker (Engineering), Dewey (Economics), Hayden (Humanities and Science), Lewis (Music), and Rotch (Arts and Architecture). There are also various specialized libraries and archives. The libraries contain more than 2.9 million printed volumes, 2.4 million microforms, 49,000 print or electronic journal subscriptions, and 670 reference databases. The past decade has seen a trend of increased focus on digital over print resources in the libraries.[265] Notable collections include the Lewis Music Library with an emphasis on 20th and 21st-century music and electronic music,[266] the List Visual Arts Center's rotating exhibitions of contemporary art,[267] and the Compton Gallery's cross-disciplinary exhibitions.[268] MIT allocates a percentage of the budget for all new construction and renovation to commission and support its extensive public art and outdoor sculpture collection.[269][270]\n\n\nThe MIT Museum was founded in 1971 and collects, preserves, and exhibits artifacts significant to the culture and history of MIT. The museum now engages in significant educational outreach programs for the general public, including the annual Cambridge Science Festival, the first celebration of this kind in the United States. Since 2005, its official mission has been, \"to engage the wider community with MIT's science, technology and other areas of scholarship in ways that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century\".[271]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nMIT was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934 and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\";[48][178] research expenditures totaled $952 million in 2017.[272] The federal government was the largest source of sponsored research, with the Department of Health and Human Services granting $255.9 million, Department of Defense $97.5 million, Department of Energy $65.8 million, National Science Foundation $61.4 million, and NASA $27.4 million.[273] MIT employs approximately 1300 researchers in addition to faculty.[274] In 2011, MIT faculty and researchers disclosed 632 inventions, were issued 153 patents, earned $85.4 million in cash income, and received $69.6 million in royalties.[275] Through programs like the Deshpande Center, MIT faculty leverage their research and discoveries into multi-million-dollar commercial ventures.[276]\n\n\nIn electronics, magnetic-core memory, radar, single-electron transistors, and inertial guidance controls were invented or substantially developed by MIT researchers.[277][278] Harold Eugene Edgerton was a pioneer in high-speed photography and sonar.[279][280] Claude E. Shannon developed much of modern information theory and discovered the application of Boolean logic to digital circuit design theory.[281] In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to cybernetics, artificial intelligence, computer languages, machine learning, robotics, and cryptography.[278][282] At least nine Turing Award laureates and seven recipients of the Draper Prize in engineering have been or are currently associated with MIT.[283][284]\n\n\nCurrent and previous physics faculty have won eight Nobel Prizes,[285] four ICTP Dirac Medals,[286] and three Wolf Prizes predominantly for their contributions to subatomic and quantum theory.[287] Members of the chemistry department have been awarded three Nobel Prizes and one Wolf Prize for the discovery of novel syntheses and methods.[285] MIT biologists have been awarded six Nobel Prizes for their contributions to genetics, immunology, oncology, and molecular biology.[285] Professor Eric Lander was one of the principal leaders of the Human Genome Project.[288][289] Positronium atoms,[290] synthetic penicillin,[291] synthetic self-replicating molecules,[292] and the genetic bases for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) and Huntington's disease were first discovered at MIT.[293] Jerome Lettvin transformed the study of cognitive science with his paper \"What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain\".[294] Researchers developed a system to convert MRI scans into 3D printed physical models.[295]\n\n\nIn the domain of humanities, arts, and social sciences, as of October 2019 MIT economists have been awarded seven Nobel Prizes and nine John Bates Clark Medals.[285][296] Linguists Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle authored seminal texts on generative grammar and phonology.[297][298] The MIT Media Lab, founded in 1985 within the School of Architecture and Planning and known for its unconventional research,[299][300] has been home to influential researchers such as constructivist educator and Logo creator Seymour Papert.[301]\n\n\nSpanning many of the above fields, MacArthur Fellowships (the so-called \"Genius Grants\") have been awarded to 50 people associated with MIT.[302] Five Pulitzer Prize–winning writers currently work at or have retired from MIT.[303] Four current or former faculty are members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.[304]\n\n\nAllegations of research misconduct or improprieties have received substantial press coverage. Professor David Baltimore, a Nobel Laureate, became embroiled in a misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led to Congressional hearings in 1991.[305][306] Professor Ted Postol has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to whitewash potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a ballistic missile defense test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed.[307][308] Associate Professor Luk Van Parijs was dismissed in 2005 following allegations of scientific misconduct and found guilty of the same by the United States Office of Research Integrity in 2009.[309][310]\n\n\nIn 2019, Clarivate Analytics named 54 members of MIT's faculty to its list of \"Highly Cited Researchers\". That number places MIT eighth among the world's universities.[311]\n\n\n\n## Discoveries and innovation[edit]\n\n\n### Natural sciences[edit]\n\n\n* Oncogene – Robert Weinberg discovered genetic basis of human cancer.[312]\n* Reverse transcription – David Baltimore independently isolated, in 1970 at MIT, two RNA tumor viruses: R-MLV and again RSV.[313]\n* Thermal death time – Samuel Cate Prescott and William Lyman Underwood from 1895 to 1898.

Applications later found useful in medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.[314]\n* Electroweak interaction – Steven Weinberg proposed the electroweak unification theory, which gave rise to the modern formulation of the Standard Model, in 1967 at MIT.[315]\n\n\n### Computer and applied sciences[edit]\n\n\n* Akamai Technologies – Daniel Lewin and Tom Leighton developed a faster content delivery network, now one of the world's largest distributed computing platforms, responsible for serving between 15 and 30 percent of all web traffic.[316]\n* Cryptography – MIT researchers Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman developed one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems, the RSA cryptosystem, and started a company, RSA Security.[317]\n* Digital circuits – Claude Shannon, while a master's degree student at MIT, developed the digital circuit design theory which paved the way for modern computers.[318]\n* Electronic ink – developed by Joseph Jacobson at MIT Media Lab.[319]\n* Emacs (text editor) – development began during the 1970s at the MIT AI Lab.[320]\n* Flight recorder (black box) – Charles Stark Draper developed the black box at MIT's Instrumentation Laboratory. That lab later made the Apollo Moon landings possible through the Apollo Guidance Computer it designed for NASA.[321]\n* GNU Project – Richard Stallman formally founded the free software movement in 1983 by launching the GNU Project at MIT.[322][323][324]\n* Julia (programming language) – Development was started in 2009, by Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman, all at MIT at that time, and continued with the contribution of a dedicated MIT Julia Lab[325]\n* Lisp (programming language) – John McCarthy invented Lisp at MIT in 1958.[326]\n* Lithium-ion battery efficiencies – Yet-Ming Chiang and his group at MIT showed a substantial improvement in the performance of lithium batteries by boosting the material's conductivity by doping it[327] with aluminium, niobium and zirconium.[328][329]\n* Macsyma, one of the oldest general-purpose computer algebra systems; the GPL-licensed version Maxima remains in wide use.[330]\n* MIT OpenCourseWare – the OpenCourseWare movement started in 1999 when the University of Tübingen in Germany published videos of lectures online for its *timms* initiative (Tübinger Internet Multimedia Server).[331] The OCW movement only took off, however, with the launch of MIT OpenCourseWare and the Open Learning Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University[332] in October 2002. The movement was soon reinforced by the launch of similar projects at Yale, Utah State University, the University of Michigan and the University of California Berkeley.[333]\n* Perdix micro-drone – autonomous drone that uses artificial intelligence to swarm with many other Perdix drones.[334]\n* Project MAC – groundbreaking research in operating systems, artificial intelligence, and the theory of computation. DARPA funded project.[335]\n* Radar – developed at MIT's Radiation Laboratory during World War II.[336]\n* SKETCHPAD – invented by Ivan Sutherland at MIT (presented in his PhD thesis). It pioneered the way for human–computer interaction (HCI).[337] Sketchpad is considered to be the ancestor of modern computer-aided design (CAD) programs as well as a major breakthrough in the development of computer graphics in general.[338]\n* VisiCalc – first spreadsheet computer program for personal computers, originally released for the Apple II by VisiCorp. MIT alumni Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston rented time sharing at night on an MIT mainframe computer (that cost $1/hr for use).[339]\n* World Wide Web Consortium – founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web[340]\n* X Window System – pioneering architecture-independent system for graphical user interfaces that has been widely used for Unix and Linux systems.[341]\n\n\n### Companies and entrepreneurship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of companies founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni\nMIT alumni and faculty have founded numerous companies, some of which are shown below:[342][343]\n\n\n* Analog Devices, 1965, co-founders Ray Stata, (SB, SM) and Matthew Lorber (SB)\n* BlackRock, 1988, co-founder Bennett Golub, (SB, SM, PhD)\n* Bose Corporation, 1964, founder Amar Bose (SB, PhD)\n* Buzzfeed, 2006, co-founder Jonah Peretti (SM)\n* Dropbox, 2007, founders Drew Houston (SB) and Arash Ferdowsi (drop-out)\n* Hewlett-Packard, 1939, co-founder William R.

However, MIT has twice awarded honorary professorships: to Winston Churchill in 1949 and Salman Rushdie in 1993.[349]\n\n\nMany upperclass students and alumni wear a large, heavy, distinctive class ring known as the \"Brass Rat\".[350][351] Originally created in 1929, the ring's official name is the \"Standard Technology Ring\".[352] The undergraduate ring design (a separate graduate student version exists as well) varies slightly from year to year to reflect the unique character of the MIT experience for that class, but always features a three-piece design, with the MIT seal and the class year each appearing on a separate face, flanking a large rectangular bezel bearing an image of a beaver.[350] The initialism IHTFP, representing the informal school motto \"I Hate This Fucking Place\" and jocularly euphemized as \"I Have Truly Found Paradise\", \"Institute Has The Finest Professors\", \"Institute of Hacks, TomFoolery and Pranks\", \"It's Hard to Fondle Penguins\", and other variations, has occasionally been featured on the ring given its historical prominence in student culture.[353]\n\n\n\n### Caltech Rivalry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Caltech–MIT rivalry\n\nMIT also shares a well-known rivalry with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), stemming from both institutions' reputations as two of the highest ranked and most highly recognized science and engineering schools in the world.[354] The rivalry is an unusual college rivalry given its focus on academics and pranks instead of sports, and due to the geographic distance between the two (their campuses are separated by about 2580 miles and are on opposite coasts of the United States). In 2005, Caltech students pranked MIT's Campus Preview Weekend by distributing t-shirts that read \"MIT\" on the front, and \"...because not everyone can go to Caltech\" on the back.[355][356][357] Additionally, the word Massachusetts in the \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" engraving on the exterior of the Lobby 7 dome was covered with a banner so that it read \"That Other Institute of Technology.\" In 2006, MIT retaliated by posing as contractors and stealing the 1.7-ton, 130-year-old Fleming cannon, a Caltech landmark. The cannon was relocated to Cambridge, where it was displayed in front of the Green Building during the 2006 Campus Preview Weekend.[358][359] In September 2010, MIT students unsuccessfully tried to place a life-sized model of the TARDIS time machine from the *Doctor Who* (1963–present) television series on top of Baxter Hall at Caltech. A few months later, Caltech students collaborated to help MIT students place the TARDIS on top of their originally planned destination.[360] The rivalry has continued, most recently in 2014, when a group of Caltech students gave out mugs sporting the MIT logo on the front and the words \"The Institute of Technology\" on the back. When heated, the mugs turned orange and read, \"Caltech, The Hotter Institute of Technology.\"[361]\n\n\n\n### Activities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Traditions and student activities at MIT\n\nSee also: Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nSee also: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology fraternities, sororities, and ILGs\n\n![](image)The start of the MIT Mystery Hunt in 2007\nMIT has over 500 recognized student activity groups,[362] including a campus radio station, *The Tech* student newspaper, an annual entrepreneurship competition, a crime club, and weekly screenings of popular films by the Lecture Series Committee. Less traditional activities include the \"world's largest open-shelf collection of science fiction\" in English, a model railroad club, and a vibrant folk dance scene. Students, faculty, and staff are involved in over 50 educational outreach and public service programs through the MIT Museum, Edgerton Center, and MIT Public Service Center.[363]\n\n\nFraternities and sororities provide a base of activities in addition to housing. Approximately 1,000 undergrads, 48% of men and 30% of women, participate in one of several dozen Greek Life men's, women's and co-ed chapters on the campus.[364]\n\n\nThe Independent Activities Period is a four-week-long \"term\" offering hundreds of optional classes, lectures, demonstrations, and other activities throughout the month of January between the Fall and Spring semesters. Some of the most popular recurring IAP activities are Autonomous Robot Design (course 6.270), Robocraft Programming (6.370), and MasLab competitions,[365] the annual \"mystery hunt\",[366] and Charm School.[367][368] More than 250 students pursue externships annually at companies in the US and abroad.[369][370]\n\n\nMany MIT students also engage in \"hacking\", which encompasses both the physical exploration of areas that are generally off-limits (such as rooftops and steam tunnels), as well as elaborate practical jokes.[371][372] Examples of high-profile hacks have included the abduction of Caltech's cannon,[373] reconstructing a Wright Flyer atop the Great Dome,[374] and adorning the John Harvard statue with the Master Chief's Mjölnir Helmet.[375]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: MIT Engineers\n\n![](image)The Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center houses a two-story fitness center as well as swimming and diving pools.\nMIT sponsors 31 varsity sports and has one of the three broadest NCAA Division III athletic programs.[376][377] MIT participates in the NCAA's Division III, the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference, the New England Football Conference, NCAA's Division I Patriot League for women's crew, and the Collegiate Water Polo Association (CWPA) for Men's Water Polo. Men's crew competes outside the NCAA in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC). The intercollegiate sports teams, called the MIT Engineers won 22 Team National Championships, 42 Individual National Championships. MIT is the all-time Division III leader in producing Academic All-Americas (302) and rank second across all NCAA Divisions only behind the University of Nebraska.[378] MIT Athletes won 13 Elite 90 awards and ranks first among NCAA Division III programs, and third among all divisions.[379] In April 2009, budget cuts led to MIT eliminating eight of its 41 sports, including the mixed men's and women's teams in alpine skiing and pistol; separate teams for men and women in ice hockey and gymnastics; and men's programs in golf and wrestling.[380][381]\n\n\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n### Students[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[382] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asian | 32%\n | 32 |\n| White | 26%\n | 26 |\n| Hispanic | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Foreign national | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Other[f] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[g] | 19%\n | 19 |\n| Affluent[h] | 81%\n | 81 |\n\n\nMIT enrolled 4,602 undergraduates and 6,972 graduate students in 2018–2019.[383] Undergraduate and graduate students came from all 50 US states as well as from 115 foreign countries.[384]\n\n\nMIT received 33,240 applications for admission to the undergraduate Class of 2025: it admitted 1,365 (4.1 percent).[385] In 2019, 29,114 applications were received for graduate and advanced degree programs across all departments; 3,670 were admitted (12.6 percent) and 2,312 enrolled (63 percent).[386]\n\n\nUndergraduate tuition and fees for 2019–2020 was $53,790 for nine months. 59% of students were awarded a need-based MIT scholarship. Graduate tuition and fees for 2019–2020 was also $53,790 for nine months, and summer tuition was $17,800. Financial support for graduate students are provided in large part by individual departments. They include fellowships, traineeships, teaching and research assistantships, and loans.[387] The annual increase in expenses had led to a student tradition (dating back to the 1960s) of tongue-in-cheek \"tuition riots\".[388]\n\n\nMIT has been nominally co-educational since admitting Ellen Swallow Richards in 1870. Richards also became the first female member of MIT's faculty, specializing in sanitary chemistry.[389][390] Female students remained a small minority prior to the completion of the first wing of a women's dormitory, McCormick Hall, in 1963.[391][392][393] Between 1993 and 2009 the proportion of women rose from 34 percent to 45 percent of undergraduates and from 20 percent to 31 percent of graduate students.[184][394] As of 2009[update], women outnumbered men in Biology, Brain & Cognitive Sciences, Architecture, Urban Planning, and Biological Engineering.[184][395]\n\n\n\n### Faculty and staff[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

Between 1964 and 2009 a total of seventeen faculty and staff members affiliated with MIT won Nobel Prizes (thirteen of them in the latter 25 years).[396] As of October 2020, 37 MIT faculty members, past or present, have won Nobel Prizes, the majority in Economics or Physics.[397]\n\n\nAs of October 2013[update], current faculty and teaching staff included 67 Guggenheim Fellows, 6 Fulbright Scholars, and 22 MacArthur Fellows.[4] Faculty members who have made extraordinary contributions to their research field as well as the MIT community are granted appointments as Institute Professors for the remainder of their tenures. Susan Hockfield, a molecular neurobiologist, served as MIT's president from 2004 to 2012. She was the first woman to hold the post.[171]\n\n\nMIT faculty members have often been recruited to lead other colleges and universities. Founding faculty-member Charles W. Eliot became president of Harvard University in 1869, a post he would hold for 40 years, during which he wielded considerable influence both on American higher education and on secondary education. MIT alumnus and faculty member George Ellery Hale played a central role in the development of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and other faculty members have been key founders of Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in nearby Needham, Massachusetts.\n\n\nAs of 2014[update] former provost Robert A. Brown served as president of Boston University; former provost Mark Wrighton is chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis; former associate provost Alice Gast is president of Lehigh University; and former professor Suh Nam-pyo is president of KAIST. Former dean of the School of Science Robert J. Birgeneau was the chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (2004–2013); former professor John Maeda was president of Rhode Island School of Design (RISD, 2008–2013); former professor David Baltimore was president of Caltech (1997–2006); and MIT alumnus and former assistant professor Hans Mark served as chancellor of the University of Texas system (1984–1992).\n\n\nIn addition, faculty members have been recruited to lead governmental agencies; for example, former professor Marcia McNutt is president of the National Academy of Sciences,[398] urban studies professor Xavier de Souza Briggs served as the associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget,[399] and biology professor Eric Lander was a co-chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[400] In 2013, faculty member Ernest Moniz was nominated by President Obama and later confirmed as United States Secretary of Energy.[401][402] Former professor Hans Mark served as Secretary of the Air Force from 1979 to 1981. Alumna and Institute Professor Sheila Widnall served as Secretary of the Air Force between 1993 and 1997, making her the first female Secretary of the Air Force and first woman to lead an entire branch of the US military in the Department of Defense. A 1999 report, met by promises of change by President Charles Vest, found that senior female faculty in the School of Science were often marginalized, and in return for equal professional accomplishments received reduced \"salary, space, awards, resources, and response to outside offers\".[403]\n\n\nAs of 2017[update], MIT was the second-largest employer in the city of Cambridge.[128] Based on feedback from employees, MIT was ranked No. 7 as a place to work, among US colleges and universities as of March 2013[update].[404] Surveys cited a \"smart\", \"creative\", \"friendly\" environment, noting that the work-life balance tilts towards a \"strong work ethic\" but complaining about \"low pay\" compared to an industry position.[405]\n\n\n\n### Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

As of October 2020[update], 41 MIT alumni have won Nobel Prizes, 48 have been selected as Rhodes Scholars,[406] 61 have been selected as Marshall Scholars,[407] and 3 have been selected as Mitchell Scholars.[408]\n\n\nAlumni in United States politics and public service include former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke, former MA-1 Representative John Olver, former CA-13 Representative Pete Stark, Representative Thomas Massie, Senator Alex Padilla, former National Economic Council chairman Lawrence H. Summers,[409] and former Council of Economic Advisers chairman Christina Romer. MIT alumni in international politics include Foreign Affairs Minister of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President of Colombia Virgilio Barco Vargas, President of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi,[410] former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan, former British Foreign Minister David Miliband, former Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Chalabi, former Minister of Education and Culture of The Republic of Indonesia Yahya Muhaimin, former Jordanian Minister of Education, Higher Education and Scientific Research and former Jordanian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Khaled Toukan. Alumni in sports have included Olympic fencing champion Johan Harmenberg.\nMIT alumni founded or co-founded many notable companies, such as Intel, McDonnell Douglas, Texas Instruments, 3Com, Qualcomm, Bose, Raytheon, Apotex, Koch Industries, Rockwell International, Genentech, Dropbox, and Campbell Soup. According to the British newspaper *The Guardian*, \"a survey of living MIT alumni found that they have formed 25,800 companies, employing more than three million people including about a quarter of the workforce of Silicon Valley. Those firms collectively generate global revenues of about $1.9 trillion (£1.2 trillion) a year\". If the companies founded by MIT alumni were a country, they would have the 11th-highest GDP of any country in the world.[411][412][413]\n\n\nMIT alumni have led prominent institutions of higher education, including the University of California system, Harvard University, the New York Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, Carnegie Mellon University, Tufts University, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Northeastern University, Tel Aviv University, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Tecnológico de Monterrey, Purdue University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, KAIST, and Quaid-e-Azam University. Berklee College of Music, the largest independent college of contemporary music in the world, was founded and led by MIT alumnus Lawrence Berk for more than three decades.\n\n\nMore than one third of the United States' crewed spaceflights have included MIT-educated astronauts, a contribution exceeding that of any university excluding the United States service academies.[414] Of the 12 people who have set foot on the Moon as of 2019[update], four graduated from MIT (among them Apollo 11 Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin). Alumnus and former faculty member Qian Xuesen led the Chinese nuclear-weapons program and became instrumental in Chinese rocket-program.[415]\n\n\nNoted alumni in non-scientific fields include author Hugh Lofting,[416] sculptor Daniel Chester French, guitarist Tom Scholz of the band Boston, the British *BBC* and *ITN* correspondent and political advisor David Walter, *The New York Times* columnist and Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, *The Bell Curve* author Charles Murray, United States Supreme Court building architect Cass Gilbert,[417]\nPritzker Prize-winning architects I.M.

Established in 1861, MIT has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and science.\n\n\nFounded in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. MIT is one of three private land grant universities in the United States, the others being Cornell University and Tuskegee University. The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River, and encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes.\n\n\nAs of October 2023[update], 101 Nobel laureates,[10] 26 Turing Award winners, and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT as alumni, faculty members, or researchers.[11] In addition, 58 National Medal of Science recipients, 29 National Medals of Technology and Innovation recipients, 50 MacArthur Fellows,[12] 83 Marshall Scholars,[13] 41 astronauts,[14] 16 Chief Scientists of the US Air Force, and various heads of states have been affiliated with MIT. The institute also has a strong entrepreneurial culture and MIT alumni have founded or co-founded many notable companies.[15][16] MIT is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU).[17]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n### Foundation and vision[edit]\n\n\n> \n> ... a school of industrial science aiding the advancement, development and practical application of science in connection with arts, agriculture, manufactures, and commerce.(Charter,1861)\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n![](image)Stereographic card showing an MIT mechanical drafting studio, 19th century (photo by E. L. Allen, left/right inverted)\n![](image)Original Rogers Building, Back Bay, Boston, c. 1901\nIn 1859, a proposal was submitted to the Massachusetts General Court to use newly filled lands in Back Bay, Boston for a \"Conservatory of Art and Science,\" but the proposal failed.[19][20] A charter for the incorporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed by William Barton Rogers, was signed by John Albion Andrew, the governor of Massachusetts, on April 10, 1861.[21]\n\n\nRogers, a former student of the College of William and Mary and professor at the University of Virginia,[22] wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances.[23][24] He did not wish to found a professional school, but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education,[25] proposing that:\n\n\n\n\n> The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.[26]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Rogers Plan reflected the German research university model, emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research, as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### Early developments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1905 map of MIT's Boston campus\n![](image)The then-new Cambridge campus, completed in 1916. Harvard Bridge, named after John Harvard, the founder of Harvard University, is in the foreground, connecting Boston to Cambridge.\nTwo days after MIT was chartered, the first battle of the Civil War broke out. After a long delay through the war years, MIT's first classes were held in the Mercantile Building in Boston in 1865.[29] The new institute was founded as part of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act to fund institutions \"to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes\" and was a land-grant school.[30][31] In 1863 under the same act, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts founded the Massachusetts Agricultural College, which developed as the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In 1866, the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the Back Bay.[32]\n\n\nMIT was informally called \"Boston Tech\".[32] The institute adopted the European polytechnic university model and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date.[27] Despite chronic financial problems, the institute saw growth in the last two decades of the 19th century under President Francis Amasa Walker.[33] Programs in electrical, chemical, marine, and sanitary engineering were introduced,[34][35] new buildings were built, and the size of the student body increased to more than one thousand.[33]\n\n\nThe curriculum drifted to a vocational emphasis, with less focus on theoretical science.[36] The fledgling school still suffered from chronic financial shortages which diverted the attention of the MIT leadership. During these \"Boston Tech\" years, MIT faculty and alumni rebuffed Harvard University president (and former MIT faculty) Charles W. Eliot's repeated attempts to merge MIT with Harvard College's Lawrence Scientific School.[37] There would be at least six attempts to absorb MIT into Harvard.[38] In its cramped Back Bay location, MIT could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities, driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding. Eventually, the MIT Corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with Harvard, over the vehement objections of MIT faculty, students, and alumni.[38] However, a 1917 decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court effectively put an end to the merger scheme.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Plaque in Building 6 honoring George Eastman, founder of Eastman Kodak, who was revealed as the anonymous \"Mr. Smith\" who helped maintain MIT's independence\nIn 1916, the MIT administration and the MIT charter crossed the Charles River on the ceremonial barge *Bucentaur* built for the occasion,[39][40] to signify MIT's move to a spacious new campus largely consisting of filled land on a one mi-long (1.6 km) tract along the Cambridge side of the Charles River.[41][42] The neoclassical \"New Technology\" campus was designed by William W. Bosworth[43] and had been funded largely by anonymous donations from a mysterious \"Mr. Smith\", starting in 1912. In January 1920, the donor was revealed to be the industrialist George Eastman of Rochester, New York, who had invented methods of film production and processing, and founded Eastman Kodak. Between 1912 and 1920, Eastman donated $20 million ($236.6 million in 2015 dollars) in cash and Kodak stock to MIT.[44]\n\n\n\n### Curricular reforms[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1930s, President Karl Taylor Compton and Vice-President (effectively Provost) Vannevar Bush emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios.[45] The Compton reforms \"renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering\".[46] Unlike Ivy League schools, MIT catered more to middle-class families, and depended more on tuition than on endowments or grants for its funding.[47] The school was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934.[48]\n\n\nStill, as late as 1949, the Lewis Committee lamented in its report on the state of education at MIT that \"the Institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school\", a \"partly unjustified\" perception the committee sought to change. The report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum, recommended offering a broader education, and warned against letting engineering and government-sponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities.[49][50] The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences and the MIT Sloan School of Management were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful Schools of Science and Engineering. Previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics, management, political science, and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs.[51][52] The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences continued to develop under the successive terms of the more humanistically oriented presidents Howard W. Johnson and Jerome Wiesner between 1966 and 1980.[53]\n\n\n\n### Defense research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ROTC students celebrate Veterans Day at MIT in 2019.\nMIT's involvement in military science surged during World War II. In 1941, Vannevar Bush was appointed head of the federal Office of Scientific Research and Development and directed funding to only a select group of universities, including MIT.[54] Engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at MIT's Radiation Laboratory, established in 1940 to assist the British military in developing microwave radar. The work done there significantly affected both the war and subsequent research in the area.[55] Other defense projects included gyroscope-based and other complex control systems for gunsight, bombsight, and inertial navigation under Charles Stark Draper's Instrumentation Laboratory;[56][57] the development of a digital computer for flight simulations under Project Whirlwind;[58] and high-speed and high-altitude photography under Harold Edgerton.[59][60] By the end of the war, MIT became the nation's largest wartime R&D contractor (attracting some criticism of Bush),[54] employing nearly 4000 in the Radiation Laboratory alone[55] and receiving in excess of $100 million ($1.2 billion in 2015 dollars) before 1946.[46] Work on defense projects continued even after then. Post-war government-sponsored research at MIT included SAGE and guidance systems for ballistic missiles and Project Apollo.[61]\n\n\n\n> \n> ... a special type of educational institution which can be defined as a university polarized around science, engineering, and the arts. We might call it a university limited in its objectives but unlimited in the breadth and the thoroughness with which it pursues these objectives.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—MIT president James Rhyne Killian\n\nThese activities affected MIT profoundly. A 1949 report noted the lack of \"any great slackening in the pace of life at the Institute\" to match the return to peacetime, remembering the \"academic tranquility of the prewar years\", though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities.[63] The faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of Karl Taylor Compton, president of MIT between 1930 and 1948; James Rhyne Killian, president from 1948 to 1957; and Julius Adams Stratton, chancellor from 1952 to 1957, whose institution-building strategies shaped the expanding university. By the 1950s, MIT no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades, and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons, philanthropic foundations and the federal government.[64]\n\n\nIn late 1960s and early 1970s, student and faculty activists protested against the Vietnam War and MIT's defense research.[65][66] In this period MIT's various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam as well as guidance systems for nuclear missiles.[67] The Union of Concerned Scientists was founded on March 4, 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems.[68] MIT ultimately divested itself from the Instrumentation Laboratory and moved all classified research off-campus to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory facility in 1973 in response to the protests.[69][70] The student body, faculty, and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities.[65] Johnson was seen to be highly successful in leading his institution to \"greater strength and unity\" after these times of turmoil.[71] However six MIT students were sentenced to prison terms at this time and some former student leaders, such as Michael Albert and George Katsiaficas, are still indignant about MIT's role in military research and its suppression of these protests.[72] (Richard Leacock's film, *November Actions*, records some of these tumultuous events.[73])\n\n\nIn the 1980s, there was more controversy at MIT over its involvement in SDI (space weaponry) and CBW (chemical and biological warfare) research.[74] More recently, MIT's research for the military has included work on robots, drones and 'battle suits'.[75]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The MIT Media Lab houses researchers developing novel uses of computer technology and shown here is the 1985 building, designed by I.M. Pei, with an extension (right of photo) designed by Fumihiko Maki opened in March 2010.\nMIT has kept pace with and helped to advance the digital age. In addition to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies,[76][77] students, staff, and faculty members at Project MAC, the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and the Tech Model Railroad Club wrote some of the earliest interactive computer video games like *Spacewar!* and created much of modern hacker slang and culture.[78] Several major computer-related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s: Richard Stallman's GNU Project and the subsequent Free Software Foundation were founded in the mid-1980s at the AI Lab; the MIT Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology;[79] the World Wide Web Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee;[80] the OpenCourseWare project has made course materials for over 2,000 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002;[81] and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005.[82]\n\n\nMIT was named a sea-grant college in 1976 to support its programs in oceanography and marine sciences and was named a space-grant college in 1989 to support its aeronautics and astronautics programs.[83][84] Despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century, MIT launched several successful development campaigns to significantly expand the campus: new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus; the Tang Center for Management Education; several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into biology, brain and cognitive sciences, genomics, biotechnology, and cancer research; and a number of new \"backlot\" buildings on Vassar Street including the Stata Center.[85] Construction on campus in the 2000s included expansions of the Media Lab, the Sloan School's eastern campus, and graduate residences in the northwest.[86][87] In 2006, President Hockfield launched the MIT Energy Research Council to investigate the interdisciplinary challenges posed by increasing global energy consumption.[88]\n\n\nIn 2001, inspired by the open source and open access movements,[89] MIT launched OpenCourseWare to make the lecture notes, problem sets, syllabi, exams, and lectures from the great majority of its courses available online for no charge, though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed.[90] While the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high,[91] OCW expanded in 2005 to include other universities as a part of the OpenCourseWare Consortium, which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages.[92] In 2011, MIT announced it would offer formal certification (but not credits or degrees) to online participants completing coursework in its \"MITx\" program, for a modest fee.[93] The \"edX\" online platform supporting MITx was initially developed in partnership with Harvard and its analogous \"Harvardx\" initiative. The courseware platform is open source, and other universities have already joined and added their own course content.[94] In March 2009 the MIT faculty adopted an open-access policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online.[95]\n\n\nMIT has its own police force. Three days after the Boston Marathon bombing of April 2013, MIT Police patrol officer Sean Collier was fatally shot by the suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, setting off a violent manhunt that shut down the campus and much of the Boston metropolitan area for a day.[96] One week later, Collier's memorial service was attended by more than 10,000 people, in a ceremony hosted by the MIT community with thousands of police officers from the New England region and Canada.[97][98][99] On November 25, 2013, MIT announced the creation of the Collier Medal, to be awarded annually to \"an individual or group that embodies the character and qualities that Officer Collier exhibited as a member of the MIT community and in all aspects of his life\". The announcement further stated that \"Future recipients of the award will include those whose contributions exceed the boundaries of their profession, those who have contributed to building bridges across the community, and those who consistently and selflessly perform acts of kindness\".[100][101][102]\n\n\nIn September 2017, the school announced the creation of an artificial intelligence research lab called the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. IBM will spend $240 million over the next decade, and the lab will be staffed by MIT and IBM scientists.[103] In October 2018 MIT announced that it would open a new Schwarzman College of Computing dedicated to the study of artificial intelligence, named after lead donor and The Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman. The focus of the new college is to study not just AI, but interdisciplinary AI education, and how AI can be used in fields as diverse as history and biology. The cost of buildings and new faculty for the new college is expected to be $1 billion upon completion.[104]\n\n\nThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from California Institute of Technology, MIT, and industrial contractors, and funded by the National Science Foundation. It was designed to open the field of gravitational-wave astronomy through the detection of gravitational waves predicted by general relativity.[105] Gravitational waves were detected for the first time by the LIGO detector in 2015. For contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves, two Caltech physicists, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish, and MIT physicist Rainer Weiss won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2017.[106] Weiss, who is also an MIT graduate, designed the laser interferometric technique, which served as the essential blueprint for the LIGO.[107]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n![](image)The central and eastern sections of MIT's campus as seen from above Massachusetts Avenue and the Charles River. Left of center is the Great Dome overlooking Killian Court, with Kendall Square to the upper right.\n![](image)MIT's Building 10 and Great Dome overlooking Killian Court\nMIT's 166-acre (67.2 ha) campus in the city of Cambridge spans approximately a mile along the north side of the Charles River basin.[6] The campus is divided roughly in half by Massachusetts Avenue, with most dormitories and student life facilities to the west and most academic buildings to the east. The bridge closest to MIT is the Harvard Bridge, which is known for being marked off in a non-standard unit of length – the smoot.[108][109]\n\n\nThe Kendall/MIT MBTA Red Line station is located on the northeastern edge of the campus, in Kendall Square. The Cambridge neighborhoods surrounding MIT are a mixture of high tech companies occupying both modern office and rehabilitated industrial buildings, as well as socio-economically diverse residential neighborhoods.[110][111] In early 2016, MIT presented its updated Kendall Square Initiative to the City of Cambridge, with plans for mixed-use educational, retail, residential, startup incubator, and office space in a dense high-rise transit-oriented development plan. The MIT Museum has moved immediately adjacent to a Kendall Square subway entrance, joining the List Visual Arts Center on the eastern end of the campus.[112]\n\n\nEach building at MIT has a number (possibly preceded by a *W*, *N*, *E*, or *NW*) designation, and most have a name as well. Typically, academic and office buildings are referred to primarily by number while residence halls are referred to by name. The organization of building numbers roughly corresponds to the order in which the buildings were built and their location relative (north, west, and east) to the original center cluster of Maclaurin buildings.[113] Many of the buildings are connected above ground as well as through an extensive network of tunnels, providing protection from the Cambridge weather as well as a venue for roof and tunnel hacking.[114][115]\n\n\nMIT's on-campus nuclear reactor[116] is one of the most powerful university-based nuclear reactors in the United States. The prominence of the reactor's containment building in a densely populated area has been controversial,[117] but MIT maintains that it is well-secured.[118] In 1999 Bill Gates donated US$20 million to MIT for the construction of a computer laboratory named the \"William H. Gates Building\", and designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[119]\n\n\nMIT Nano, also known as Building 12, is an interdisciplinary facility for nanoscale research. Its 100,000 sq ft (9,300 m2) cleanroom and research space, visible through expansive glass facades, is the largest research facility of its kind in the nation.[120] With a cost of US$400 million, it is also one of the costliest buildings on campus. The facility also provides state-of-the-art nanoimaging capabilities with vibration damped imaging and metrology suites sitting atop a 5×10~~^~~6 lb (2,300,000 kg) slab of concrete underground.[121]\n\n\nOther notable campus facilities include a pressurized wind tunnel for testing aerodynamic research, a towing tank for testing ship and ocean structure designs, and previously Alcator C-Mod, which was the largest fusion device operated by any university.[122][123] MIT's campus-wide wireless network was completed in the fall of 2005 and consists of nearly 3,000 access points covering 9.4×10~~^~~6 sq ft (870,000 m2) of campus.[124]\n\n\nIn 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT for violating the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act with regard to its hazardous waste storage and disposal procedures.[125] MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects.[126] In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.[127]\n\n\nMIT has substantial commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge on which it pays property taxes, plus an additional voluntary payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) on academic buildings which are legally tax-exempt. As of 2017[update], it is the largest taxpayer in the city, contributing approximately 14% of the city's annual revenues.[128] Holdings include Technology Square, parts of Kendall Square, and many properties in Cambridgeport and Area 4 neighboring the educational buildings.[129] The land is held for investment purposes and potential long-term expansion.[130]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Stata Center houses CSAIL, LIDS, and the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy.\nMIT's School of Architecture, now the School of Architecture and Planning, was the first formal architecture program in the United States,[131] and it has a history of commissioning progressive buildings.[132][133] The first buildings constructed on the Cambridge campus, completed in 1916, are sometimes called the \"Maclaurin buildings\" after Institute president Richard Maclaurin who oversaw their construction. Designed by William Welles Bosworth, these imposing buildings were built of reinforced concrete, a first for a non-industrial – much less university – building in the US.[134] Bosworth's design was influenced by the City Beautiful Movement of the early 1900s[134] and features the Pantheon-esque Great Dome housing the Barker Engineering Library. The Great Dome overlooks Killian Court, where graduation ceremonies are held each year. The friezes of the limestone-clad buildings around Killian Court are engraved with the names of important scientists and philosophers.[a] The spacious Building 7 atrium at 77 Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the entrance to the Infinite Corridor and the rest of the campus.[111]\n\n\nAlvar Aalto's Baker House (1947), Eero Saarinen's MIT Chapel and Kresge Auditorium (1955), and I.M. Pei's Green, Dreyfus, Landau, and Wiesner buildings represent high forms of post-war modernist architecture.[137][138][139] More recent buildings like Frank Gehry's Stata Center (2004), Steven Holl's Simmons Hall (2002), Charles Correa's Building 46 (2005), and Fumihiko Maki's Media Lab Extension (2009) stand out among the Boston area's classical architecture and serve as examples of contemporary campus \"starchitecture\".[132][140] These buildings have not always been well received;[141][142] in 2010, *The Princeton Review* included MIT in a list of twenty schools whose campuses are \"tiny, unsightly, or both\".[143]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Housing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nSee also: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology fraternities, sororities, and ILGs\n\n![](image)The Simmons Hall undergrad dormitory was completed in 2002.\nUndergraduates are guaranteed four-year housing in one of MIT's 11 undergraduate dormitories.[144] Those living on campus can receive support and mentoring from live-in graduate student tutors, resident advisors, and faculty housemasters.[145] Because housing assignments are made based on the preferences of the students themselves, diverse social atmospheres can be sustained in different living groups; for example, according to the *Yale Daily News* staff's *The Insider's Guide to the Colleges, 2010*, \"The split between East Campus and West Campus is a significant characteristic of MIT. East Campus has gained a reputation as a thriving counterculture.\"[146] MIT also has 5 dormitories for single graduate students and 2 apartment buildings on campus for married student families.[147]\n\n\nMIT has an active Greek and co-op housing system, including thirty-six fraternities, sororities, and independent living groups (FSILGs).[148] As of 2015[update], 98% of all undergraduates lived in MIT-affiliated housing; 54% of the men participated in fraternities and 20% of the women were involved in sororities.[149] Most FSILGs are located across the river in Back Bay near where MIT was founded, and there is also a cluster of fraternities on MIT's West Campus that face the Charles River Basin.[150] After the 1997 alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger, a new pledge at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT required all freshmen to live in the dormitory system starting in 2002.[151] Because FSILGs had previously housed as many as 300 freshmen off-campus, the new policy could not be implemented until Simmons Hall opened in that year.[152]\n\n\nIn 2013–2014, MIT abruptly closed and then demolished undergrad dorm Bexley Hall, citing extensive water damage that made repairs infeasible. In 2017, MIT shut down Senior House after a century of service as an undergrad dorm. That year, MIT administrators released data showing just 60% of Senior House residents had graduated in four years. Campus-wide, the four-year graduation rate is 84% (the cumulative graduation rate is significantly higher).[153]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lobby 7 at 77 Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the main entrance to campus.\nMIT is chartered as a non-profit organization and is owned and governed by a privately appointed board of trustees known as the MIT Corporation.[154] The current board consists of 43 members elected to five-year terms,[155] 25 life members who vote until their 75th birthday,[156] 3 elected officers (President, Treasurer, and Secretary),[157] and 4 *ex officio* members (the president of the alumni association, the Governor of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Secretary of Education, and the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court).[158][159] The board is chaired by Diane Greene SM ’78, co-founder and former CEO of VMware and former CEO of Google Cloud.[160] The Corporation approves the budget, new programs, degrees and faculty appointments, and elects the President to serve as the chief executive officer of the university and preside over the Institute's faculty.[111][161] MIT's endowment and other financial assets are managed through a subsidiary called MIT Investment Management Company (MITIMCo).[162] Valued at $16.4 billion in 2018, MIT's endowment was then the sixth-largest among American colleges and universities.[163]\n\n\nMIT has five schools (Science, Engineering, Architecture and Planning, Management, and Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences) and one college (Schwarzman College of Computing), but no schools of law or medicine.[164][b][166] While faculty committees assert substantial control over many areas of MIT's curriculum, research, student life, and administrative affairs,[167] the chair of each of MIT's 32 academic departments reports to the dean of that department's school, who in turn reports to the Provost under the President.[168] The current president is Sally Kornbluth, a cell biologist and former provost at Duke University. She became MIT's 18th president in January 2023.[169] She was preceded by L. Rafael Reif, who had served as provost under President Susan Hockfield, the first woman to hold the post.[170][171]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFall first-time freshman admission statistics\n|  | 2022[172] | 2021[173] | 2020[174] | 2019[175] | 2018[176] | 2017[177] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Applicants\n | 33,767 | 33,240 | 20,075 | 21,312 | 21,706 | 20,247\n |\n| Admits\n | 1,337 | 1,365 | 1,457 | 1,427 | 1,464 | 1,452\n |\n| Enrolls\n | 1,136 | 1,177 | 1,070 | 1,102 | 1,114 | 1,097\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 4.0% | 4.1% | 7.3% | 6.7% | 6.7% | 7.2%\n |\n| Yield rate\n | 85.0% | 86.2% | 73.4% | 77.2% | 76.1% | 75.5%\n |\n| SAT composite\\*\n | 1520⁠–1570(78%†) | 1510⁠–1570(70%†) | 1510⁠–1570(77%†) | 1510⁠–1570(76%†) | 1500⁠–1570(75%†) | 1490⁠–1570(72%†) |\n| ACT composite\\*\n | 35–36(32%†) | 34–36(34%†) | 34–36(42%†) | 34–36(45%†) | 34–36(48%†) | 33–35(55%†) |\n| \\* middle 50% range † percentage of first-time freshmen who chose to submit\n |\n\n\nMIT is a large, highly residential, research university with a majority of enrollments in graduate and professional programs.[178] The university has been accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges since 1929.[179] MIT operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall semester beginning after Labor Day and ending in mid-December, a 4-week \"Independent Activities Period\" in the month of January, and the spring semester commencing in early February and ceasing in late May.[180]\n\n\nMIT students refer to both their majors and classes using numbers or acronyms alone.[181] Departments and their corresponding majors are numbered in the approximate order of their foundation; for example, Civil and Environmental Engineering is Course 1, while Linguistics and Philosophy is Course 24.[182] Students majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), the most popular department, collectively identify themselves as \"Course 6\". MIT students use a combination of the department's course number and the number assigned to the class to identify their subjects; for instance, the introductory calculus-based classical mechanics course is simply \"8.01\" (pronounced *eight-oh-one*) at MIT.[183][c]\n\n\n\n### Undergraduate program[edit]\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment in MIT (2017–2023)\n| Academic Year\n | Undergraduates\n | Graduate\n | Total Enrollment\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017–2018[177] | 4,547 | 6,919 | 11,466\n |\n| 2018–2019[176] | 4,602 | 6,972 | 11,574\n |\n| 2019–2020[175] | 4,530 | 6,990 | 11,520\n |\n| 2020–2021[174] | 4,361 | 6,893 | 11,254\n |\n| 2021–2022[173] | 4,638 | 7,296 | 11,934\n |\n| 2022–2023[172] | 4,657 | 7,201 | 11,858\n |\n\n\nThe four-year, full-time undergraduate program maintains a balance between professional majors and those in the arts and sciences. In 2010, it was dubbed \"most selective\" by *U.S. News*,[186] admitting few transfer students[178] and 4.1% of its applicants in the 2020–2021 admissions cycle.[187] It is need-blind for both domestic and international applicants.[188] MIT offers 44 undergraduate degrees across its five schools.[189] In the 2017–2018 academic year, 1,045 Bachelor of Science degrees (abbreviated \"SB\") were granted, the only type of undergraduate degree MIT now awards.[*needs update*][190][191] In the 2011 fall term, among students who had designated a major, the School of Engineering was the most popular division, enrolling 63% of students in its 19 degree programs, followed by the School of Science (29%), School of Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences (3.7%), Sloan School of Management (3.3%), and School of Architecture and Planning (2%).[*needs update*] The largest undergraduate degree programs were in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Course 6–2), Computer Science and Engineering (Course 6–3), Mechanical Engineering (Course 2), Physics (Course 8), and Mathematics (Course 18).[184]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Infinite Corridor is the primary passageway through campus.\n\n\nAll undergraduates are required to complete a core curriculum called the General Institute Requirements (GIRs).[192] The Science Requirement, generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors, comprises two semesters of physics, two semesters of calculus, one semester of chemistry, and one semester of biology. There is a Laboratory Requirement, usually satisfied by an appropriate class in a course major. The Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Requirement consists of eight semesters of classes in the humanities, arts, and social sciences, including at least one semester from each division as well as the courses required for a designated concentration in a HASS division. Under the Communication Requirement, two of the HASS classes, plus two of the classes taken in the designated major must be \"communication-intensive\",[193] including \"substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation\".[194] Finally, all students are required to complete a swimming test;[195] non-varsity athletes must also take four quarters of physical education classes.[192]\n\n\nMost classes rely on a combination of lectures, recitations led by associate professors or graduate students, weekly problem sets (\"p-sets\"), and periodic quizzes or tests. While the pace and difficulty of MIT coursework has been compared to \"drinking from a fire hose\",[196][197][198] the freshmen retention rate at MIT is similar to other research universities.[186] The \"pass/no-record\" grading system relieves some pressure for first-year undergraduates. For each class taken in the fall term, freshmen transcripts will either report only that the class was passed, or otherwise not have any record of it. In the spring term, passing grades (A, B, C) appear on the transcript while non-passing grades are again not recorded.[199] (Grading had previously been \"pass/no record\" all freshman year, but was amended for the Class of 2006 to prevent students from gaming the system by completing required major classes in their freshman year.[200]) Also, freshmen may choose to join alternative learning communities, such as Experimental Study Group, Concourse, or Terrascope.[199]\n\n\nIn 1969, Margaret MacVicar founded the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) to enable undergraduates to collaborate directly with faculty members and researchers. Students join or initiate research projects (\"UROPs\") for academic credit, pay, or on a volunteer basis through postings on the UROP website or by contacting faculty members directly.[201] A substantial majority of undergraduates participate.[202][203] Students often become published, file patent applications, and/or launch start-up companies based upon their experience in UROPs.[204][205]\n\n\nIn 1970, the then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder, published *The Hidden Curriculum,* arguing that education at MIT was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education. The successful student, according to Snyder, was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms. For example, organized student groups had compiled \"course bibles\"—collections of problem-set and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references. This sort of gamesmanship, Snyder argued, hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest.[206][207]\n\n\n\n### Graduate program[edit]\n\n\nMIT's graduate program has high coexistence with the undergraduate program, and many courses are taken by qualified students at both levels. MIT offers a comprehensive doctoral program with degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields as well as professional degrees, including the Master of Business Administration (MBA).[178] The Institute offers graduate programs leading to academic degrees such as the Master of Science (which is abbreviated as MS at MIT), various Engineer's Degrees, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), and Doctor of Science (DSc) and interdisciplinary graduate programs such as the MD-PhD (with Harvard Medical School) and a joint program in oceanography with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.[208][209][210][211]\n\n\nAdmission to graduate programs is decentralized; applicants apply directly to the department or degree program. More than 90% of doctoral students are supported by fellowships, research assistantships (RAs), or teaching assistantships (TAs).[212]\n\n\n\n### MIT Bootcamps[edit]\n\n\nMIT Bootcamps are intense week-long innovation and leadership programs that challenge participants to develop a venture in a week.[213] Each Bootcamp centers around a particular topic, specific to an industry, leadership skill set, or emerging technology. Cohorts are organized into small teams who work on an entrepreneurial project together, in addition to individual learning and team coaching. The program includes a series of online seminars with MIT faculty, practitioners, and industry experts, innovation workshops with bootcamp instructors focused on putting the theory participants have learned into practice, coaching sessions, and informal office hours for learners to exchange ideas freely. Bootcampers are tasked with weekly \"deliverables\", which are key elements of a business plan, to help guide the group through the decision-making process involved in building an enterprise. The experience culminates in a final pitch session, judged by a panel of experts.[214]\n\n\nMIT Bootcamp instructors include Eric von Hippel, Sanjay Sarma, Erdin Beshimov, and Bill Aulet.[215] MIT Bootcamps were founded by Erdin Beshimov.[216][214][217]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[218] | 1 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[219] | 2

the QS World University Rankings, and the Academic Ranking of World Universities have ranked MIT's School of Engineering first, as did the 1995 National Research Council report.[229] In the same lists, MIT's strongest showings apart from in engineering are in computer science, the natural sciences, business, architecture, economics, linguistics, mathematics, and, to a lesser extent, political science and philosophy.[230]\n\n\nTimes Higher Education has recognized MIT as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, Oxford, and Stanford.[231] In 2019, it was ranked #3 among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[232] In 2017, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings also rated MIT the #2 university for arts and humanities.[233][234] MIT was ranked #7 in 2015 and #6 in 2017 of the Nature Index Annual Tables, which measure the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[235][236][237] Georgetown University researchers ranked MIT #3 in the US for 20-year return on investment.[238]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Collaborations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eero Saarinen's Kresge Auditorium (1955) is a classic example of post-war architecture.\nThe university historically pioneered research and training collaborations between academia, industry and government.[239][240] In 1946, President Compton, Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot, and Massachusetts Investor Trust chairman Merrill Grisswold founded American Research and Development Corporation, the first American venture-capital firm.[241][242] In 1948, Compton established the MIT Industrial Liaison Program.[243] Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer-funded research and technology to international – especially Japanese – firms that were competing with struggling American businesses.[244][245] On the other hand, MIT's extensive collaboration with the federal government on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940.[d] MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy.[247][248]\n\n\nThe US Justice Department began an investigation in 1989, and in 1991 filed an antitrust suit against MIT, the eight Ivy League colleges, and eleven other institutions for allegedly engaging in price-fixing during their annual \"Overlap Meetings\", which were held to prevent bidding wars over promising prospective students from consuming funds for need-based scholarships.[249][250] While the Ivy League institutions settled,[251] MIT contested the charges, arguing that the practice was not anti-competitive because it ensured the availability of aid for the greatest number of students.[252][253] MIT ultimately prevailed when the Justice Department dropped the case in 1994.[254][255]\n\n\n\n![](image)Walker Memorial is a monument to MIT's fourth president, Francis Amasa Walker.\n![](image)MIT main campus seen from Vassar Street, as The Great Dome is visible in the distance and the Stata Center is at right\nMIT's proximity[e] to Harvard University (\"the other school up the river\") has led to a substantial number of research collaborations such as the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and the Broad Institute.[256] In addition, students at the two schools can cross-register for credits toward their own school's degrees without any additional fees.[256] A cross-registration program between MIT and Wellesley College has also existed since 1969, and in 2002 the Cambridge–MIT Institute launched an undergraduate exchange program between MIT and the University of Cambridge.[256] MIT also has a long-term partnership with Imperial College London, for both student exchanges and research collaboration.[257][258] More modest cross-registration programs have been established with Boston University, Brandeis University, Tufts University, Massachusetts College of Art, and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.[256]\n\n\nMIT maintains substantial research and faculty ties with independent research organizations in the Boston area, such as the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.[211] Ongoing international research and educational collaborations include the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS Institute), Singapore-MIT Alliance, MIT-Politecnico di Milano,[256][259] MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, and projects in other countries through the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) program.[256][260]\n\n\nThe mass-market magazine *Technology Review* is published by MIT through a subsidiary company, as is a special edition that also serves as an alumni magazine.[261][262] The MIT Press is a major university press, publishing over 200 books and 30 journals annually, emphasizing science and technology as well as arts, architecture, new media, current events, and social issues.[263]\n\n\nMIT Microphotonics Center and PhotonDelta founded the global roadmap for integrated photonics: Integrated Photonics Systems Roadmap – International (IPSR-I). The first edition has been published in 2020. The roadmap is an amalgamation of two previously independent roadmaps: the IPSR roadmap of MIT Microphotonics Center and AIM Photonics in the United States, and the WTMF (World Technology Mapping Forum) of PhotonDelta in Europe.[264]\n\n\n\n### Libraries, collections, and museums[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Libraries and Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology § Artwork\n\nThe MIT library system consists of five subject libraries: Barker (Engineering), Dewey (Economics), Hayden (Humanities and Science), Lewis (Music), and Rotch (Arts and Architecture). There are also various specialized libraries and archives. The libraries contain more than 2.9 million printed volumes, 2.4 million microforms, 49,000 print or electronic journal subscriptions, and 670 reference databases. The past decade has seen a trend of increased focus on digital over print resources in the libraries.[265] Notable collections include the Lewis Music Library with an emphasis on 20th and 21st-century music and electronic music,[266] the List Visual Arts Center's rotating exhibitions of contemporary art,[267] and the Compton Gallery's cross-disciplinary exhibitions.[268] MIT allocates a percentage of the budget for all new construction and renovation to commission and support its extensive public art and outdoor sculpture collection.[269][270]\n\n\nThe MIT Museum was founded in 1971 and collects, preserves, and exhibits artifacts significant to the culture and history of MIT. The museum now engages in significant educational outreach programs for the general public, including the annual Cambridge Science Festival, the first celebration of this kind in the United States. Since 2005, its official mission has been, \"to engage the wider community with MIT's science, technology and other areas of scholarship in ways that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century\".[271]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nMIT was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934 and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\";[48][178] research expenditures totaled $952 million in 2017.[272] The federal government was the largest source of sponsored research, with the Department of Health and Human Services granting $255.9 million, Department of Defense $97.5 million, Department of Energy $65.8 million, National Science Foundation $61.4 million, and NASA $27.4 million.[273] MIT employs approximately 1300 researchers in addition to faculty.[274] In 2011, MIT faculty and researchers disclosed 632 inventions, were issued 153 patents, earned $85.4 million in cash income, and received $69.6 million in royalties.[275] Through programs like the Deshpande Center, MIT faculty leverage their research and discoveries into multi-million-dollar commercial ventures.[276]\n\n\nIn electronics, magnetic-core memory, radar, single-electron transistors, and inertial guidance controls were invented or substantially developed by MIT researchers.[277][278] Harold Eugene Edgerton was a pioneer in high-speed photography and sonar.[279][280] Claude E. Shannon developed much of modern information theory and discovered the application of Boolean logic to digital circuit design theory.[281] In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to cybernetics, artificial intelligence, computer languages, machine learning, robotics, and cryptography.[278][282] At least nine Turing Award laureates and seven recipients of the Draper Prize in engineering have been or are currently associated with MIT.[283][284]\n\n\nCurrent and previous physics faculty have won eight Nobel Prizes,[285] four ICTP Dirac Medals,[286] and three Wolf Prizes predominantly for their contributions to subatomic and quantum theory.[287] Members of the chemistry department have been awarded three Nobel Prizes and one Wolf Prize for the discovery of novel syntheses and methods.[285] MIT biologists have been awarded six Nobel Prizes for their contributions to genetics, immunology, oncology, and molecular biology.[285] Professor Eric Lander was one of the principal leaders of the Human Genome Project.[288][289] Positronium atoms,[290] synthetic penicillin,[291] synthetic self-replicating molecules,[292] and the genetic bases for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) and Huntington's disease were first discovered at MIT.[293] Jerome Lettvin transformed the study of cognitive science with his paper \"What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain\".[294] Researchers developed a system to convert MRI scans into 3D printed physical models.[295]\n\n\nIn the domain of humanities, arts, and social sciences, as of October 2019 MIT economists have been awarded seven Nobel Prizes and nine John Bates Clark Medals.[285][296] Linguists Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle authored seminal texts on generative grammar and phonology.[297][298] The MIT Media Lab, founded in 1985 within the School of Architecture and Planning and known for its unconventional research,[299][300] has been home to influential researchers such as constructivist educator and Logo creator Seymour Papert.[301]\n\n\nSpanning many of the above fields, MacArthur Fellowships (the so-called \"Genius Grants\") have been awarded to 50 people associated with MIT.[302] Five Pulitzer Prize–winning writers currently work at or have retired from MIT.[303] Four current or former faculty are members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.[304]\n\n\nAllegations of research misconduct or improprieties have received substantial press coverage. Professor David Baltimore, a Nobel Laureate, became embroiled in a misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led to Congressional hearings in 1991.[305][306] Professor Ted Postol has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to whitewash potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a ballistic missile defense test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed.[307][308] Associate Professor Luk Van Parijs was dismissed in 2005 following allegations of scientific misconduct and found guilty of the same by the United States Office of Research Integrity in 2009.[309][310]\n\n\nIn 2019, Clarivate Analytics named 54 members of MIT's faculty to its list of \"Highly Cited Researchers\". That number places MIT eighth among the world's universities.[311]\n\n\n\n## Discoveries and innovation[edit]\n\n\n### Natural sciences[edit]\n\n\n* Oncogene – Robert Weinberg discovered genetic basis of human cancer.[312]\n* Reverse transcription – David Baltimore independently isolated, in 1970 at MIT, two RNA tumor viruses: R-MLV and again RSV.[313]\n* Thermal death time – Samuel Cate Prescott and William Lyman Underwood from 1895 to 1898. Done for canning of food. Applications later found useful in medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.[314]\n* Electroweak interaction – Steven Weinberg proposed the electroweak unification theory, which gave rise to the modern formulation of the Standard Model, in 1967 at MIT.[315]\n\n\n### Computer and applied sciences[edit]\n\n\n* Akamai Technologies – Daniel Lewin and Tom Leighton developed a faster content delivery network, now one of the world's largest distributed computing platforms, responsible for serving between 15 and 30 percent of all web traffic.[316]\n* Cryptography – MIT researchers Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman developed one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems, the RSA cryptosystem, and started a company, RSA Security.[317]\n* Digital circuits – Claude Shannon, while a master's degree student at MIT, developed the digital circuit design theory which paved the way for modern computers.[318]\n* Electronic ink – developed by Joseph Jacobson at MIT Media Lab.[319]\n* Emacs (text editor) – development began during the 1970s at the MIT AI Lab.[320]\n* Flight recorder (black box) – Charles Stark Draper developed the black box at MIT's Instrumentation Laboratory. That lab later made the Apollo Moon landings possible through the Apollo Guidance Computer it designed for NASA.[321]\n* GNU Project – Richard Stallman formally founded the free software movement in 1983 by launching the GNU Project at MIT.[322][323][324]\n* Julia (programming language) – Development was started in 2009, by Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman, all at MIT at that time, and continued with the contribution of a dedicated MIT Julia Lab[325]\n* Lisp (programming language) – John McCarthy invented Lisp at MIT in 1958.[326]\n* Lithium-ion battery efficiencies – Yet-Ming Chiang and his group at MIT showed a substantial improvement in the performance of lithium batteries by boosting the material's conductivity by doping it[327] with aluminium, niobium and zirconium.[328][329]\n* Macsyma, one of the oldest general-purpose computer algebra systems; the GPL-licensed version Maxima remains in wide use.[330]\n* MIT OpenCourseWare – the OpenCourseWare movement started in 1999 when the University of Tübingen in Germany published videos of lectures online for its *timms* initiative (Tübinger Internet Multimedia Server).[331] The OCW movement only took off, however, with the launch of MIT OpenCourseWare and the Open Learning Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University[332] in October 2002. The movement was soon reinforced by the launch of similar projects at Yale, Utah State University, the University of Michigan and the University of California Berkeley.[333]\n* Perdix micro-drone – autonomous drone that uses artificial intelligence to swarm with many other Perdix drones.[334]\n* Project MAC – groundbreaking research in operating systems, artificial intelligence, and the theory of computation. DARPA funded project.[335]\n* Radar – developed at MIT's Radiation Laboratory during World War II.[336]\n* SKETCHPAD – invented by Ivan Sutherland at MIT (presented in his PhD thesis). It pioneered the way for human–computer interaction (HCI).[337] Sketchpad is considered to be the ancestor of modern computer-aided design (CAD) programs as well as a major breakthrough in the development of computer graphics in general.[338]\n* VisiCalc – first spreadsheet computer program for personal computers, originally released for the Apple II by VisiCorp. MIT alumni Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston rented time sharing at night on an MIT mainframe computer (that cost $1/hr for use).[339]\n* World Wide Web Consortium – founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web[340]\n* X Window System – pioneering architecture-independent system for graphical user interfaces that has been widely used for Unix and Linux systems.[341]\n\n\n### Companies and entrepreneurship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of companies founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni\nMIT alumni and faculty have founded numerous companies, some of which are shown below:[342][343]\n\n\n* Analog Devices, 1965, co-founders Ray Stata, (SB, SM) and Matthew Lorber (SB)\n* BlackRock, 1988, co-founder Bennett Golub, (SB, SM, PhD)\n* Bose Corporation, 1964, founder Amar Bose (SB, PhD)\n* Buzzfeed, 2006, co-founder Jonah Peretti (SM)\n* Dropbox, 2007, founders Drew Houston (SB) and Arash Ferdowsi (drop-out)\n* Hewlett-Packard, 1939, co-founder William R.

However, MIT has twice awarded honorary professorships: to Winston Churchill in 1949 and Salman Rushdie in 1993.[349]\n\n\nMany upperclass students and alumni wear a large, heavy, distinctive class ring known as the \"Brass Rat\".[350][351] Originally created in 1929, the ring's official name is the \"Standard Technology Ring\".[352] The undergraduate ring design (a separate graduate student version exists as well) varies slightly from year to year to reflect the unique character of the MIT experience for that class, but always features a three-piece design, with the MIT seal and the class year each appearing on a separate face, flanking a large rectangular bezel bearing an image of a beaver.[350] The initialism IHTFP, representing the informal school motto \"I Hate This Fucking Place\" and jocularly euphemized as \"I Have Truly Found Paradise\", \"Institute Has The Finest Professors\", \"Institute of Hacks, TomFoolery and Pranks\", \"It's Hard to Fondle Penguins\", and other variations, has occasionally been featured on the ring given its historical prominence in student culture.[353]\n\n\n\n### Caltech Rivalry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Caltech–MIT rivalry\n\nMIT also shares a well-known rivalry with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), stemming from both institutions' reputations as two of the highest ranked and most highly recognized science and engineering schools in the world.[354] The rivalry is an unusual college rivalry given its focus on academics and pranks instead of sports, and due to the geographic distance between the two (their campuses are separated by about 2580 miles and are on opposite coasts of the United States). In 2005, Caltech students pranked MIT's Campus Preview Weekend by distributing t-shirts that read \"MIT\" on the front, and \"...because not everyone can go to Caltech\" on the back.[355][356][357] Additionally, the word Massachusetts in the \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" engraving on the exterior of the Lobby 7 dome was covered with a banner so that it read \"That Other Institute of Technology.\" In 2006, MIT retaliated by posing as contractors and stealing the 1.7-ton, 130-year-old Fleming cannon, a Caltech landmark. The cannon was relocated to Cambridge, where it was displayed in front of the Green Building during the 2006 Campus Preview Weekend.[358][359] In September 2010, MIT students unsuccessfully tried to place a life-sized model of the TARDIS time machine from the *Doctor Who* (1963–present) television series on top of Baxter Hall at Caltech. A few months later, Caltech students collaborated to help MIT students place the TARDIS on top of their originally planned destination.[360] The rivalry has continued, most recently in 2014, when a group of Caltech students gave out mugs sporting the MIT logo on the front and the words \"The Institute of Technology\" on the back. When heated, the mugs turned orange and read, \"Caltech, The Hotter Institute of Technology.\"[361]\n\n\n\n### Activities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Traditions and student activities at MIT\n\nSee also: Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nSee also: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology fraternities, sororities, and ILGs\n\n![](image)The start of the MIT Mystery Hunt in 2007\nMIT has over 500 recognized student activity groups,[362] including a campus radio station, *The Tech* student newspaper, an annual entrepreneurship competition, a crime club, and weekly screenings of popular films by the Lecture Series Committee. Less traditional activities include the \"world's largest open-shelf collection of science fiction\" in English, a model railroad club, and a vibrant folk dance scene. Students, faculty, and staff are involved in over 50 educational outreach and public service programs through the MIT Museum, Edgerton Center, and MIT Public Service Center.[363]\n\n\nFraternities and sororities provide a base of activities in addition to housing. Approximately 1,000 undergrads, 48% of men and 30% of women, participate in one of several dozen Greek Life men's, women's and co-ed chapters on the campus.[364]\n\n\nThe Independent Activities Period is a four-week-long \"term\" offering hundreds of optional classes, lectures, demonstrations, and other activities throughout the month of January between the Fall and Spring semesters. Some of the most popular recurring IAP activities are Autonomous Robot Design (course 6.270), Robocraft Programming (6.370), and MasLab competitions,[365] the annual \"mystery hunt\",[366] and Charm School.[367][368] More than 250 students pursue externships annually at companies in the US and abroad.[369][370]\n\n\nMany MIT students also engage in \"hacking\", which encompasses both the physical exploration of areas that are generally off-limits (such as rooftops and steam tunnels), as well as elaborate practical jokes.[371][372] Examples of high-profile hacks have included the abduction of Caltech's cannon,[373] reconstructing a Wright Flyer atop the Great Dome,[374] and adorning the John Harvard statue with the Master Chief's Mjölnir Helmet.[375]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: MIT Engineers\n\n![](image)The Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center houses a two-story fitness center as well as swimming and diving pools.\nMIT sponsors 31 varsity sports and has one of the three broadest NCAA Division III athletic programs.[376][377] MIT participates in the NCAA's Division III, the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference, the New England Football Conference, NCAA's Division I Patriot League for women's crew, and the Collegiate Water Polo Association (CWPA) for Men's Water Polo. Men's crew competes outside the NCAA in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC). The intercollegiate sports teams, called the MIT Engineers won 22 Team National Championships, 42 Individual National Championships. MIT is the all-time Division III leader in producing Academic All-Americas (302) and rank second across all NCAA Divisions only behind the University of Nebraska.[378] MIT Athletes won 13 Elite 90 awards and ranks first among NCAA Division III programs, and third among all divisions.[379] In April 2009, budget cuts led to MIT eliminating eight of its 41 sports, including the mixed men's and women's teams in alpine skiing and pistol; separate teams for men and women in ice hockey and gymnastics; and men's programs in golf and wrestling.[380][381]\n\n\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n### Students[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[382] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asian | 32%\n | 32 |\n| White | 26%\n | 26 |\n| Hispanic | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Foreign national | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Other[f] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[g] | 19%\n | 19 |\n| Affluent[h] | 81%\n | 81 |\n\n\nMIT enrolled 4,602 undergraduates and 6,972 graduate students in 2018–2019.[383] Undergraduate and graduate students came from all 50 US states as well as from 115 foreign countries.[384]\n\n\nMIT received 33,240 applications for admission to the undergraduate Class of 2025: it admitted 1,365 (4.1 percent).[385] In 2019, 29,114 applications were received for graduate and advanced degree programs across all departments; 3,670 were admitted (12.6 percent) and 2,312 enrolled (63 percent).[386]\n\n\nUndergraduate tuition and fees for 2019–2020 was $53,790 for nine months. 59% of students were awarded a need-based MIT scholarship. Graduate tuition and fees for 2019–2020 was also $53,790 for nine months, and summer tuition was $17,800. Financial support for graduate students are provided in large part by individual departments. They include fellowships, traineeships, teaching and research assistantships, and loans.[387] The annual increase in expenses had led to a student tradition (dating back to the 1960s) of tongue-in-cheek \"tuition riots\".[388]\n\n\nMIT has been nominally co-educational since admitting Ellen Swallow Richards in 1870. Richards also became the first female member of MIT's faculty, specializing in sanitary chemistry.[389][390] Female students remained a small minority prior to the completion of the first wing of a women's dormitory, McCormick Hall, in 1963.[391][392][393] Between 1993 and 2009 the proportion of women rose from 34 percent to 45 percent of undergraduates and from 20 percent to 31 percent of graduate students.[184][394] As of 2009[update], women outnumbered men in Biology, Brain & Cognitive Sciences, Architecture, Urban Planning, and Biological Engineering.[184][395]\n\n\n\n### Faculty and staff[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

Between 1964 and 2009 a total of seventeen faculty and staff members affiliated with MIT won Nobel Prizes (thirteen of them in the latter 25 years).[396] As of October 2020, 37 MIT faculty members, past or present, have won Nobel Prizes, the majority in Economics or Physics.[397]\n\n\nAs of October 2013[update], current faculty and teaching staff included 67 Guggenheim Fellows, 6 Fulbright Scholars, and 22 MacArthur Fellows.[4] Faculty members who have made extraordinary contributions to their research field as well as the MIT community are granted appointments as Institute Professors for the remainder of their tenures. Susan Hockfield, a molecular neurobiologist, served as MIT's president from 2004 to 2012. She was the first woman to hold the post.[171]\n\n\nMIT faculty members have often been recruited to lead other colleges and universities. Founding faculty-member Charles W. Eliot became president of Harvard University in 1869, a post he would hold for 40 years, during which he wielded considerable influence both on American higher education and on secondary education. MIT alumnus and faculty member George Ellery Hale played a central role in the development of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and other faculty members have been key founders of Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in nearby Needham, Massachusetts.\n\n\nAs of 2014[update] former provost Robert A. Brown served as president of Boston University; former provost Mark Wrighton is chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis; former associate provost Alice Gast is president of Lehigh University; and former professor Suh Nam-pyo is president of KAIST. Former dean of the School of Science Robert J. Birgeneau was the chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (2004–2013); former professor John Maeda was president of Rhode Island School of Design (RISD, 2008–2013); former professor David Baltimore was president of Caltech (1997–2006); and MIT alumnus and former assistant professor Hans Mark served as chancellor of the University of Texas system (1984–1992).\n\n\nIn addition, faculty members have been recruited to lead governmental agencies; for example, former professor Marcia McNutt is president of the National Academy of Sciences,[398] urban studies professor Xavier de Souza Briggs served as the associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget,[399] and biology professor Eric Lander was a co-chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[400] In 2013, faculty member Ernest Moniz was nominated by President Obama and later confirmed as United States Secretary of Energy.[401][402] Former professor Hans Mark served as Secretary of the Air Force from 1979 to 1981. Alumna and Institute Professor Sheila Widnall served as Secretary of the Air Force between 1993 and 1997, making her the first female Secretary of the Air Force and first woman to lead an entire branch of the US military in the Department of Defense. A 1999 report, met by promises of change by President Charles Vest, found that senior female faculty in the School of Science were often marginalized, and in return for equal professional accomplishments received reduced \"salary, space, awards, resources, and response to outside offers\".[403]\n\n\nAs of 2017[update], MIT was the second-largest employer in the city of Cambridge.[128] Based on feedback from employees, MIT was ranked No. 7 as a place to work, among US colleges and universities as of March 2013[update].[404] Surveys cited a \"smart\", \"creative\", \"friendly\" environment, noting that the work-life balance tilts towards a \"strong work ethic\" but complaining about \"low pay\" compared to an industry position.[405]\n\n\n\n### Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

As of October 2020[update], 41 MIT alumni have won Nobel Prizes, 48 have been selected as Rhodes Scholars,[406] 61 have been selected as Marshall Scholars,[407] and 3 have been selected as Mitchell Scholars.[408]\n\n\nAlumni in United States politics and public service include former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke, former MA-1 Representative John Olver, former CA-13 Representative Pete Stark, Representative Thomas Massie, Senator Alex Padilla, former National Economic Council chairman Lawrence H. Summers,[409] and former Council of Economic Advisers chairman Christina Romer. MIT alumni in international politics include Foreign Affairs Minister of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President of Colombia Virgilio Barco Vargas, President of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi,[410] former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan, former British Foreign Minister David Miliband, former Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Chalabi, former Minister of Education and Culture of The Republic of Indonesia Yahya Muhaimin, former Jordanian Minister of Education, Higher Education and Scientific Research and former Jordanian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Khaled Toukan. Alumni in sports have included Olympic fencing champion Johan Harmenberg.\nMIT alumni founded or co-founded many notable companies, such as Intel, McDonnell Douglas, Texas Instruments, 3Com, Qualcomm, Bose, Raytheon, Apotex, Koch Industries, Rockwell International, Genentech, Dropbox, and Campbell Soup. According to the British newspaper *The Guardian*, \"a survey of living MIT alumni found that they have formed 25,800 companies, employing more than three million people including about a quarter of the workforce of Silicon Valley. Those firms collectively generate global revenues of about $1.9 trillion (£1.2 trillion) a year\". If the companies founded by MIT alumni were a country, they would have the 11th-highest GDP of any country in the world.[411][412][413]\n\n\nMIT alumni have led prominent institutions of higher education, including the University of California system, Harvard University, the New York Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, Carnegie Mellon University, Tufts University, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Northeastern University, Tel Aviv University, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Tecnológico de Monterrey, Purdue University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, KAIST, and Quaid-e-Azam University. Berklee College of Music, the largest independent college of contemporary music in the world, was founded and led by MIT alumnus Lawrence Berk for more than three decades.\n\n\nMore than one third of the United States' crewed spaceflights have included MIT-educated astronauts, a contribution exceeding that of any university excluding the United States service academies.[414] Of the 12 people who have set foot on the Moon as of 2019[update], four graduated from MIT (among them Apollo 11 Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin). Alumnus and former faculty member Qian Xuesen led the Chinese nuclear-weapons program and became instrumental in Chinese rocket-program.[415]\n\n\nNoted alumni in non-scientific fields include author Hugh Lofting,[416] sculptor Daniel Chester French, guitarist Tom Scholz of the band Boston, the British *BBC* and *ITN* correspondent and political advisor David Walter, *The New York Times* columnist and Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, *The Bell Curve* author Charles Murray, United States Supreme Court building architect Cass Gilbert,[417]\nPritzker Prize-winning architects I.M. Pei and Gordon Bunshaft.\n\n\n\n* ![Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, ScD 1963 (MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics)](image)\n\nApollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, ScD 1963 (MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics)\n* ![Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, SM 1972 (MIT Sloan School of Management)](image)\n\nFormer UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, SM 1972 (MIT Sloan School of Management)\n* ![President of Colombia (1986–1990) Virgilio Barco Vargas, SB 1943 (MIT Civil and Environmental Engineering)](image)\n\nPresident of Colombia (1986–1990) Virgilio Barco Vargas, SB 1943 (MIT Civil and Environmental Engineering)\n* ![Former Federal Reserve Bank chairman and 2022 Nobel Laureate Ben Bernanke, PhD 1979 (MIT Department of Economics)](image)\n\nFormer Federal Reserve Bank chairman and 2022 Nobel Laureate Ben Bernanke, PhD 1979 (MIT Department of Economics)\n* ![Economics Nobel laureate Esther Duflo, PhD 1999 (MIT Department of Economics), also an MIT professor[418]](image)\n\nEconomics Nobel laureate Esther Duflo, PhD 1999 (MIT Department of Economics), also an MIT professor[418]\n* ![Physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, SB 1939 (MIT Department of Physics)[419]](image)\n\nPhysicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, SB 1939 (MIT Department of Physics)[419]\n* ![Astronaut and USAF Colonel Michael Fincke, SB 1989 (MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics), SB 1989 (MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences)](image)\n\nAstronaut and USAF Colonel Michael Fincke, SB 1989 (MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics), SB 1989 (MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences)\n* ![Sculptor Daniel Chester French, Did not graduate](image)\n\nSculptor Daniel Chester French, Did not graduate\n* ![Economics Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, PhD 1977 (MIT Department of Economics)](image)\n\nEconomics Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, PhD 1977 (MIT Department of Economics)\n* ![Space Shuttle Challenger astronaut and physicist Ronald McNair, PhD 1976 (MIT Department of Physics)](image)\n\nSpace Shuttle *Challenger* astronaut and physicist Ronald McNair, PhD 1976 (MIT Department of Physics)\n* ![Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, SB 1975 (MIT Architecture), SM 1976 (MIT Sloan School of Management)](image)\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, SB 1975 (MIT Architecture), SM 1976 (MIT Sloan School of Management)\n* ![Architect I.

Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world's third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university's founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople.[10][11] The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*. In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter granted by King Henry III.\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge includes 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic departments, faculties, and other institutions organised into six schools. All of the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, managing their own personnel and policies, and all students are required to have a college affiliation within the university. Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge is centred on weekly small-group supervisions in the colleges with lectures, seminars, laboratory work, and occasionally further supervision provided by the central university faculties and departments.[12][13]\n\n\nThe university operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Cambridge's 116 libraries hold a total of approximately 16 million books, around nine million of which are in Cambridge University Library, a legal deposit library and one of the world's largest academic libraries. Cambridge alumni, academics, and affiliates have won 121 Nobel Prizes.[14] Among the university's notable alumni are 194 Olympic medal-winning athletes[15] and several historically iconic and transformational individuals in their respective fields, including Francis Bacon, Lord Byron, Oliver Cromwell, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking, John Maynard Keynes, John Milton, Vladimir Nabokov, Jawaharlal Nehru, Isaac Newton, Bertrand Russell, Alan Turing, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Cambridge\n\nPrior to the founding of the University of Cambridge in 1209, Cambridge and the area surrounding it already had developed a scholarly and ecclesiastical reputation due largely to the intellectual reputation and academic contributions of monks from the nearby bishopric church in Ely. The founding of the University of Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman, were hanged by town authorities without first consulting ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford's town authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. Enough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the new university's formation.[16][17][18]\n\n\nBy 1225, a chancellor of the university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231 established that rents in Cambridge were to be set *secundum consuetudinem universitatis*, according to the custom of the university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\nAfter Cambridge was described as a *studium generale* in a letter from Pope Nicholas IV in 1290,[20] and confirmed as such by Pope John XXII's 1318 papal bull,[21] it became common for researchers from other European medieval universities to visit Cambridge to study or give lecture courses.[20]\n\n\n\n### Foundation of the colleges[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Colleges of the University of Cambridge and Oxford and Cambridge Act 1571\n\n![](image)Emmanuel College Chapel\n![](image)Peterhouse, Cambridge's first college, founded in 1284\nThe colleges at the University of Cambridge were originally an incidental feature of the university; no college within the University of Cambridge is as old as the university itself. The colleges within the university were initially endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels, which were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, and they have left some traces, including the naming of Garret Hostel Lane and Garret Hostel Bridge, a street and bridge in Cambridge.[22]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge's first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, the Bishop of Ely. Multiple additional colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, and colleges continued being established through modern times, though there was a 204-year gap between the founding of Sidney Sussex in 1596 and that of Downing in 1800. The most recent college to be established is Robinson, which was built in the late 1970s. Most recently, in March 2010, Homerton College achieved full university college status, making it technically the university's newest full college.\n\n\nIn medieval times, many colleges were founded so that their members could pray for the souls of the founders. University of Cambridge colleges often were associated with chapels or abbeys. The colleges' focus began to shift in 1536, however, with the dissolution of the monasteries and Henry VIII's order that the university disband the canon law that governed the university's faculty[23] and stop teaching scholastic philosophy. In response, colleges changed their curricula from canon law to classics, the Bible, and mathematics.\n\n\nNearly a century later, the university found itself at the centre of a Protestant schism. Many nobles, intellectuals, and even commoners saw the Church of England as too similar to the Catholic Church and felt that it was being used by The Crown to usurp the counties' rightful powers. East Anglia emerged as the centre of what ultimately became the Puritan movement. In Cambridge, the Puritan movement was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine Hall, Sidney Sussex, and Christ's Colleges.[24] These colleges produced many non-conformist graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or preaching, some 20,000 Puritans who ultimately left England for New England and especially Massachusetts Bay Colony during the Great Migration decade of the 1630s, joining the Virginia colony and others in becoming settlers in some of the fledgling American colonies.\n\n\n\n### Mathematics and mathematical physics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lucasian Professor of Mathematics and Mathematical Tripos\n\nThe university quickly established itself as a global leader in the study of mathematics. The university's examination in mathematics, known as the Mathematical Tripos,[25] was initially compulsory for all undergraduates studying for the Bachelor of Arts degree, the most common degree first offered at Cambridge. From the time of Isaac Newton in the late 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained an especially strong emphasis on applied mathematics, and especially mathematical physics. Students awarded first class honours after completing the mathematics Tripos exam are called wranglers, and the top student among them is known as the Senior Wrangler, a position that has been described as \"the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in Britain.\"[26]\n\n\nThe Cambridge Mathematical Tripos is highly competitive and has helped produce some of the most famous names in British science, including James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Lord Rayleigh.[27] However, some famous students, such as G. H. Hardy, disliked the Tripos system, feeling that students were becoming too focused on accumulating high exam marks at the expense of the subject itself.\n\n\nPure mathematics at the University of Cambridge in the 19th century achieved great things, though it largely missed out on substantial developments in French and German mathematics. By the early 20th century, however, pure mathematical research at Cambridge reached the highest international standard, thanks largely to G. H. Hardy and his collaborators, J. E. Littlewood and Srinivasa Ramanujan. W. V. D. Hodge and others helped establish Cambridge as a global leader in geometry in the 1930s.\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge movement (philosophy)\n\n![](image)Selwyn College, founded in 1882\nThe Cambridge University Act 1856 formalised the university's organisational structure and introduced the study of many new subjects, including theology, history, and Modern languages.[28] Resources necessary for new courses in the arts, architecture, and archaeology were donated by Viscount Fitzwilliam of Trinity College, who also founded Fitzwilliam Museum in 1816.[29] In 1847, Prince Albert was elected the university's chancellor in a close contest with the Earl of Powis. As chancellor, Albert reformed university curricula beyond its initial focus on mathematics and classics, adding modern era history and the natural sciences. Between 1896 and 1902, Downing College sold part of its land to permit the construction of Downing Site, the university's grouping of scientific laboratories for the study of anatomy, genetics, and Earth sciences.[30] During this period, the New Museums Site was erected, including the Cavendish Laboratory, which has since moved to West Cambridge, and other departments for chemistry and medicine.[31]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge began to award PhD degrees in the first third of the 20th century; the first Cambridge PhD in mathematics was awarded in 1924.[32]\n\n\nThe university contributed significantly to the Allies' forces in World War I with 13,878 members of the university serving and 2,470 being killed in action during the war. Teaching, and the fees it earned, nearly came to a halt during World War I, and severe financial difficulties followed. As a result, the university received its first systematic state support in 1919, and a Royal commission was appointed in 1920 to recommend that the university (but not its colleges) begin receiving an annual grant.[33] Following World War II, the university experienced a rapid expansion in applications and enrollment, partly due to the success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.[34] This was not without controversies, however. For example, Cambridge researchers were accused in 2023 of helping to develop weapon systems for Iran.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Parliamentary representation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nSee also: Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge was one of only two universities to hold parliamentary seats in the Parliament of England and was later one of 19 represented in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The constituency was created by a Royal charter of 1603 and returned two members of parliament until 1950 when it was abolished by the Representation of the People Act 1948. The constituency was not a geographical area; rather, its electorate consisted of university graduates. Before 1918, the franchise was restricted to male graduates with a doctorate or MA degree.\n\n\n\n### Women's education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Newnham College, one of two female-only colleges at the university\nFor the first several centuries of its existence, as was the case broadly in England and the world, the University of Cambridge was only open to male students. The first colleges established for women were Girton College, founded by Emily Davies in 1869, Newnham College, founded by Anne Clough and Henry Sidgwick in 1872, Hughes Hall, founded in 1885 by Elizabeth Phillips Hughes as the Cambridge Teaching College for Women, Murray Edwards College, founded in 1954 by Rosemary Murray as New Hall, and Lucy Cavendish College, founded in 1965. Prior to ultimately being permitted admission to the university in 1948, female students were granted the right to take University of Cambridge exams beginning in the late 19th century.[36] Women were also allowed to study courses, take examinations, and have prior exam results recorded retroactively, dating back to 1881; for a brief period after the turn of the 20th century, this allowed the steamboat ladies to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[37]\n\n\nBeginning in 1921, women were awarded diplomas that conferred the title associated with the Bachelor of Arts degree. But since women were not yet admitted to the Bachelor of Arts degree program, they were excluded from the university's governance structure. Since University of Cambridge students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to few university colleges that had been established only for them. Darwin College, the first graduate college of the university, matriculated both male and female students from its inception in 1964 and elected a mixed fellowship. Undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare, and King's Colleges, began admitting women between 1972 and 1988. Among women's colleges at the university, Girton began admitting male students in 1979, and Lucy Cavendish began admitting men in 2021. But the other female-only colleges have remained female-only colleges as of 2023. As a result of St Hilda's College, Oxford ending its ban on male students in 2008, Cambridge is now the only remaining university in the United Kingdom with female-only colleges; the two female-only colleges at the university are Newnham and Murray Edwards.[38][39] As of the 2019–2020 academic year, the university's male to female enrollment, including post-graduates, was nearly balanced with its total student population being 53% male and 47% female.[40]\n\n\nIn 2018 and later years, the university has come under some criticism and faced legal challenges over alleged sexual harassment at the university.[41][42] In 2019, for example, former student Danielle Bradford, represented by sexual harassment lawyer Ann Olivarius, sued the university for its handling of her sexual misconduct complaint. \"I was told that I should think about it very carefully because making a complaint could affect my place in my department,\" Bradford alleged in 2019.[43] In 2020, hundreds of current and former students accused the university in a letter, citing \"a complete failure\" to deal with sexual misconduct complaints.[44]\n\n\n\n### Town and gown[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Town and gown\n\nFurther information: Away with the learning of clerks, away with it! and Silicon Fen\n\nThe relationship between the university and the city of Cambridge has sometimes been uneasy. The phrase town and gown continues to be employed to distinguish between Cambridge residents (town) and University of Cambridge students (gown), who historically wore academical dress. Ferocious rivalry between Cambridge's residents and university students have periodically erupted over the centuries. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, strong clashes led to attacks and looting of university properties as locals contested the privileges granted by the British government to the University of Cambridge's academic staff. Residents burned university property in Market Square to the famed rallying cry \"Away with the learning of clerks, away with it!\".[45] Following these events, the University of Cambridge's Chancellor was given special powers allowing him to prosecute criminals and reestablish order in the city. Attempts at reconciliation between the city's residents and students followed; in the 16th century, agreements were signed to improve the quality of streets and student accommodation around the city. However, this was followed by new confrontations when the plague reached Cambridge in 1630 and colleges refused to assist those affected by the disease by locking their sites.[46]\n\n\nSuch conflicts between Cambridge's residents and university students have largely disappeared since the 16th century, and the university has grown as a source of enormous employment and expanded wealth in Cambridge and the region.[47] The university also has proven a source of extraordinary growth in high tech and biotech start-ups and established companies and associated providers of services to these companies. The economic growth associated with the university's high tech and biotech growth has been labeled the Cambridge Phenomenon, and has included the addition of 1,500 new companies and as many as 40,000 new jobs added between 1960 and 2010, mostly at Silicon Fen, a business cluster launched by the university in the late 20th century.[48]\n\n\n\n### Myths, legends and traditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Cambridge legends\n\nSee also: Category:Terminology of the University of Cambridge\n\nFurther information: Nine Lessons and Carols and wooden spoon (award)\n\n![](image)Mathematical Bridge crossing River Cam at Queens' College\nPartly because of the University of Cambridge's extensive history, which now exceeds 800 years, the university has developed a large number of traditions, myths, and legends. Some are true, some are not, and some were true but have been discontinued but have been propagated nonetheless by generations of students and tour guides.\n\n\nOne such discontinued tradition is that of the wooden spoon, the prize awarded to the student with the lowest passing honours grade in the final examinations of the university's Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club at St John's College. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John's College. Since 1908, examination results have been published alphabetically within class rather than in strict order of merit, which made it difficult to ascertain the student with the lowest passing grade deserving of the spoon, leading to discontinuation of the tradition.\n\n\nEach Christmas Eve, The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, sung by the Choir of King's College, are broadcast globally on BBC World Service television and radio and syndicated to hundreds of additional radio stations in the U.S. and elsewhere. The radio broadcast has been a national Christmas Eve tradition since 1928, though the festival has existed since 1918 and the celebration itself originated even earlier at Truro Cathedral in Cornwall in 1880.[49] The first television broadcast of the festival was in 1954.[50][51]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nFront Court of King's College, founded in 1441 by King Henry VI\n\n## Locations and buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The entrance to the original Cavendish Laboratory on the New Museums Site\n![](image)The Faculty of Education building\n![](image)The Faculty of Law building on the Sidgwick Site\n### Buildings[edit]\n\n\nSee also: A Classical Adventure: The Architectural History of Downing College, Cambridge; Cambridge Medical School building; Cambridge Observatory; Cambridge University Library; Cambridge University Real Tennis Club; Fitzwilliam Museum; Goldie Boathouse; Lady Mitchell Hall; Old Schools; Senate House, Cambridge; Scott Polar Research Institute; University of Cambridge Sports Centre; and William Gates Building, Cambridge\n\nThe university occupies a central location within the city of Cambridge. University of Cambridge students represent approximately 20 percent of the town's population, which was 145,674 as of 2021, and contributes on whole to a lower age demographic in the city.[52]\n\n\nMost of the university's older colleges are located near the city centre through which River Cam flows. Students and others traditionally punt on the River Cam, which provides views of the university's buildings and campuses that surround the river.[53]\n\n\nNotable University of Cambridge buildings include King's College Chapel,[54] the history faculty building[55] designed by James Stirling, and the Cripps Building at St John's College.[56] The brickwork of several colleges is notable: Queens' College has some of the earliest patterned brickwork in England[57] and the brick walls of St John's College are examples of English bond, Flemish bond, and Running bond.[58]\n\n\n\n### Sites[edit]\n\n\nThe university is divided into several sites, which house the university's various departments, including:[59]\n\n\n\n* Addenbrooke's Hospital\n* Downing Site\n* Madingley/Gorton\n* New Museums Site\n* North West Cambridge Development\n* Old Addenbrooke's Site\n* Old Schools\n* Silver Street/Mill Lane\n* Sidgwick Site\n* West Cambridge\n\nThe university's School of Clinical Medicine is based in Addenbrooke's Hospital, where medical students undergo their three-year clinical placement period after obtaining their BA degree.[60] The West Cambridge site is undergoing a major expansion and will host new buildings and fields for university sports.[61] Since 1990, Cambridge Judge Business School, on Trumpington Street, provides management education courses and is consistently ranked among the top 20 business schools in the world by *Financial Times*.[62]\n\n\nGiven that the sites are in relative proximity and the area around Cambridge is reasonably flat, one of the favourite modes of transport for students is the bicycle; an estimated one-fifth of journeys in the city are made by bike, a figure enhanced by the fact that students are not permitted to hold car park permits except under special circumstances.[63]\n\n\n\n### Notable locations[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge and its constituent colleges include many notable locations, some of which are iconic or of historical, academic, religious, and cultural significance, including:\n\n\n\n* Bridge of Sighs, Cambridge\n* Cambridge University Botanic Garden\n* Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge\n* Downing Site\n* Fenner's\n* Goldie Boathouse\n* King's College Chapel, Cambridge\n* Lady Mitchell Hall\n* Mathematical Bridge\n* Nevile's Court, Trinity College, Cambridge\n* Sidgwick Site\n* St Bene't's Church\n* The Backs\n* Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge\n* West Cambridge\n\n## Organisation and administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of institutions of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)View over Trinity College, Gonville and Caius College, Trinity Hall, and Clare College towards King's College Chapel seen from St John's College Chapel on the left. In front of King's College Chapel is the Senate House.\nCambridge is a collegiate university, which means that its colleges are self-governing and independent, each with its own property, endowments, and income. Most colleges bring together academics and students from a broad range of disciplines. Each faculty, school, or department at the university includes academics affiliated with differing colleges.\n\n\nThe college faculties are responsible for giving lectures, arranging seminars, performing research, and determining the syllabi for teaching, all of which is overseen by the university's general board. Together with the central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor, the college faculties make up the University of Cambridge. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels by the university. The Cambridge University Library is the university's largest and primary library. Squire Law Library is the primary library for the university's students of law. Individual colleges each maintain a multi-discipline library designed for each college's respective undergraduates.\n\n\nThe university is legally structured as an exempt charity and a common law corporation. Its corporate titles include the Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge.[64]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Gonville and Caius College\n![](image)Margaret Wileman Building at Hughes Hall\n![](image)The President's Lodge at Queens' College\n![](image)Bridge of Sighs over the River Cam at St John's College\nThe colleges are self-governing institutions with their own endowments and property, each founded as components of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. The colleges' importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees but undergraduates receive their overall academic supervision through small group teaching sessions, which often include just one student within the colleges, though in many cases students go to other colleges for supervision if the teaching fellows at their college do not specialise in a student's particular area of academic focus. Each college appoints its own teaching staff and fellows, both of whom are members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university standards and regulations.\n\n\nCambridge has 31 colleges, two of which, Murray Edwards and Newnham, admit women only. The other colleges are mixed. Darwin was the first college to admit both men and women. In 1972, Churchill, Clare, and King's were the first previously all-male colleges to admit female undergraduates. In 1988, Magdalene became the last all-male college to accept women.[65] Clare Hall and Darwin admit only postgraduates, and Hughes Hall, St Edmund's, and Wolfson admit only mature undergraduate and graduate students who are 21 years or older on the date of their matriculation. Lucy Cavendish, which was previously a women-only mature college, began admitting both men and women in 2021.[66] All other colleges admit both undergraduate and postgraduate students without any age restrictions.\n\n\nColleges are not required to admit students in all subjects; some colleges choose not to offer subjects such as architecture, art history, or theology, but most offer a complete range of academic specialties and related courses. Some colleges maintain a relative strength and associated reputation for expertise in certain academic disciplines. Churchill, for example, has a reputation for its expertise and focus on the sciences and engineering, in part due to the requirement made by Winston Churchill upon the college's founding that 70% of its students studied mathematics, engineering, and the sciences.[67] Other colleges have more informal academic focus and even demonstrated ideological focus, such as King's, which is known for its left-wing political orientation,[68] and Robinson and Churchill, both of which have a reputation for academic focus on sustainability and environmentalism.[69]\n\n\nCosts to students for room and board vary considerably from college to college.[70][71] Similarly, the investment in student education by each college at the university varies widely between the colleges.[72]\n\n\nThree theological colleges at the university, Westcott House, Westminster College, and Ridley Hall Theological College, are members of the Cambridge Theological Federation and associated in partnership with university.[73]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge's 31 colleges are:[74]\n\n\n\n1. ![Christ's College heraldic shield](image) Christ's\n2. ![Churchill College heraldic shield](image) Churchill\n3. ![Clare College heraldic shield](image) Clare\n4. ![Clare Hall heraldic shield](image) Clare Hall\n5. ![Corpus Christi heraldic shield](image) Corpus Christi\n6. ![Darwin College heraldic shield](image) Darwin\n7. ![Downing College heraldic shield](image) Downing\n8. ![Emmanuel College heraldic shield](image) Emmanuel\n9. ![Fitzwilliam College heraldic shield](image) Fitzwilliam\n10. ![](image) Girton\n11. ![Gonville and Caius College heraldic shield](image) Gonville & Caius\n12. ![](image) Homerton\n13. ![Hughes Hall heraldic shield](image) Hughes Hall\n14. ![Jesus College heraldic shield](image) Jesus\n15. ![King's College heraldic shield](image) King's\n16. ![Lucy Cavendish College heraldic shield](image) Lucy Cavendish\n17. ![Magdalene College heraldic shield](image) Magdalene\n18. ![](image) Murray Edwards\n19. ![Newnham College heraldic shield](image) Newnham\n20. ![Pembroke College heraldic shield](image) Pembroke\n21. ![Peterhouse coat of arms](image) Peterhouse\n22. ![Queens' College heraldic shield](image) Queens'\n23. ![Robinson College heraldic shield](image) Robinson\n24. ![Selwyn College heraldic shield](image) Selwyn\n25. ![Sidney Sussex College heraldic shield](image) Sidney Sussex\n26. ![St Catharine's College heraldic shield](image) St Catharine's\n27. ![](image) St Edmund's\n28. ![St John's College heraldic shield](image) St John's\n29. ![Trinity College coat of arms](image) Trinity\n30. ![Trinity Hall heraldic shield](image) Trinity Hall\n31. ![Wolfson College Crest](image) Wolfson\n\n### Schools, faculties and departments[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of institutions of the University of Cambridge § Schools, Faculties, and Departments\n\n![](image)Institute of Continuing Education at Madingley Hall\n![](image)Old Schools (left) houses the university's administrative offices.\nIn addition to the 31 colleges, the university maintains over 150 departments, faculties, schools, syndicates, and other academic institutions.[75] Members of these are usually members of one of the colleges, and responsibility for the entire academic programme of the university is divided among them.\n\n\nThe university has a department dedicated to providing continuing education, the Institute of Continuing Education, which is based primarily in Madingley Hall, a 16th-century manor house in Cambridgeshire. Its award-bearing programmes include both undergraduate certificates and part-time master's degrees.[76]\n\n\nA school in the University of Cambridge is a broad administrative grouping of related faculties and other units. Each has an elected supervisory body known as a Council, composed of representatives of the various constituent bodies. The University of Cambridge maintains six such schools:[77]\n\n\n\n* Arts and Humanities\n* Biological Sciences\n* Clinical Medicine\n* Humanities and Social Sciences\n* Physical Sciences\n* Technology\n\nTeaching and research at the university is organised by faculties. The faculties have varying organisational substructures that partly reflect their respective histories and the university's operational needs, which may include a number of departments and other institutions. A small number of bodies called syndicates hold responsibility for teaching and research, including for the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, the University Press, and the University Library.\n\n\n\n### Central administration[edit]\n\n\n#### Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of chancellors of the University of Cambridge and List of vice-chancellors of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Regent House officers following a July 2014 graduation ceremony\n![](image)Faculty of Divinity at the university\nThe Chancellor of the university is limitless term position that is mainly ceremonial and is held currently by David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville, who succeeded the Duke of Edinburgh following his retirement on his 90th birthday in June 2011. Lord Sainsbury was nominated by the nomination board.[78][79][80][81] The election took place on 14 and 15 October 2011[81] with Sainsbury taking 2,893 of the 5,888 votes cast, and winning on the election's first count.\n\n\nThe current acting vice-chancellor is Anthony Freeling, who was appointed in 2022[82] While the Chancellor's office is ceremonial, the Vice-Chancellor serves as the university's *de facto* principal administrative officer. The university's internal governance is carried out almost entirely by Regent House augmented by some external representation from the Audit Committee and four external members of the University's Council.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Senate and the Regent House[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Light show on Senate House for the 800th anniversary of the university's founding\n![](image)Old Court at Clare College\nThe university Senate consists of all holders of the MA or higher degrees and is responsible for electing the Chancellor and the High Steward. Until 1950 when the Cambridge University constituency was abolished, it was also responsible for electing two members of the House of Commons. Prior to 1926, the university Senate was the university's governing body, fulfilling the functions that Regent House has provided since.[84] Regent House is the university's governing body, a direct democracy comprising all resident senior members of the university and the colleges, the Chancellor, the High Steward, the Deputy High Steward, and the Commissary.[85] Public representatives of Regent House are the two Proctors, elected to serve for one year terms upon their nominations by the colleges.\n\n\n\n#### Council and General Board[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senate House Passage in the snow with Senate House on the right and Gonville and Caius College on the left\nAlthough the University Council is the university's principal executive and policy-making body, the Council reports to, and is held accountable by, Regent House through a variety of checks and balances. The council is obliged to advise Regent House on matters of general concern to the university, which it does by publishing notices to the *Cambridge University Reporter*, the university's official journal.[86] In March 2008, Regent House voted to increase from two to four the number of external members on the council,[87][88] and this was approved by Her Majesty the Queen in July 2008.[89]\n\n\nThe General Board of the Faculties is responsible for the university's academic and educational policies[90] and is accountable to the council for its management of these affairs.\n\n\nFaculty boards are accountable to the general board; other boards and syndicates are accountable either to the general board or to the council. Under this organizational structure, the university's various arms are kept under supervision of both the central administration and Regent House.[91]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n#### Benefactions and fundraising[edit]\n\n\nIn the fiscal year ending 31 July 2019, the central university, excluding colleges, reported total income of £2.192 billion, of which £592.4 million was from research grants and contracts.[4] In the decade prior to 2019, the University of Cambridge reported an average of £271m a year in philanthropic donations.[4]\n\n\nThe university maintains multiple scholarship programs. The Stormzy Scholarship for Black UK Students covers tuition costs for two students and maintenance grants for up to four years.[92]\n\n\nIn 2000, Bill Gates of Microsoft donated US$210 million through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to endow Gates Scholarships for students from outside the United Kingdom pursuing post-graduate study at Cambridge.[93]\n\n\nIn October 2021, the university suspended its £400m collaboration with the United Arab Emirates, citing allegations that UAE was involved in illegal hacking of the university's computer and storage systems using NSO Group's Pegasus software. UAE also was behind the leak of over 50,000 phone numbers, including hundreds belonging to British citizens. Stephen Toope, the university's outgoing Vice-Chancellor, said the decision to suspend its collaboration with UAE also was a result of additional revelations about UAE's Pegasus software hacking.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Bonds[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge borrowed £350 million in October 2012 by issuing 40-year security bonds,[95] whose interest rate is approximately 0.6 percent higher than the British government's 40-year bond.[96]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations and memberships[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, the International Alliance of Research Universities, and it is part of the so-called golden triangle of research intensive universities in the south of England.[97] It is also closely linked to the high tech business cluster known as Silicon Fen and is part of Cambridge University Health Partners, Europe's largest academic health science centre.\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics\n|  | 2022[98] | 2021[99] | 2020[100] | 2019[101] | 2018[102] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 22,470\n | 22,795\n | 20,426\n | 19,359\n | 18,378\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 18.9\n | 18.7\n | 23.1\n | 24.3\n | 24.8\n |\n| **Enrols** | 3,544\n | 3,660\n | 3,997\n | 3,528\n | 3,465\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 83.6\n | 85.9\n | 84.9\n | 75.2\n | 76.0\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 6.34\n | 6.23\n | 5.11\n | 5.49\n | 5.30\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[103] | —\n | 209\n | 207\n | 205\n | 212\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition\n| Domicile[104] and Ethnicity[105] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 47%\n | 47 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[b] | 21%\n | 21 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 23%\n | 23 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[106][107] |\n| Female | 50%\n | 50 |\n| Private School | 30%\n | 30 |\n| Low Participation Areas[c] | 5%\n | 5 |\n\n\n#### Process[edit]\n\n\n![Peterhouse Old Court](image)Peterhouse Old Court\n![](image)Great Court of Trinity College, dating back to the 16th Century\nAdmission to the University of Cambridge is competitive. In 2018–2019, for instance, 18.8% of applicants were admitted.[108][109] In 2021, Cambridge introduced an over-subscription clause to its offers of admission, which also permits the university to withdraw acceptances if too many students meet its selective entrance criteria. The clause can be invoked in the event of circumstances outside the reasonable control of the university. The clause was introduced following a record number of A-level pupils obtained the highest grades from teacher assessment, which was introduced due to the cancellation of A-level examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.[110][111]\n\n\nThe university's standard offer for most courses is set at A\\*AA,[112][113] with A\\*A\\*A for science courses, or equivalent in other examination systems, e.g. 7,6,6 or 7,7,6 in IB. Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, an interview process was introduced as a component of consideration for admission. Interviews are performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors including potential for original thinking and creativity.[114] For exceptional candidates, a matriculation offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above. Sutton Trust maintains that the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge recruit disproportionately from eight schools, which account for 1,310 Oxbridge places over three years contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[115]\n\n\nStrong applicants who are not successful in being admitted to their chosen college at the university may be placed in the Winter Pool, where they can be considered for admission to other university colleges, which maintains consistency throughout the colleges, some of which receive more applicants than others.\n\n\nUndergraduate applications are processed through UCAS, and the deadline for their submission currently is mid-October in the year before prior to beginning. Until the 1980s, candidates for all subjects were required to take special entrance examinations,[116] which have since been replaced by additional tests for some subjects, such as the Thinking Skills Assessment and Cambridge Law Test.[117] The university has at times considered reintroducing an admissions exam for all subjects.[118]\n\n\nGraduate admission is first decided by the faculty or department responsible for the applicant's respective academic subject. An offer of acceptance effectively guarantees admission to the university, though not necessarily the applicant's preferred choice of college.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Winter pool[edit]\n\n\nThe **Winter Pool** or **inter-College Pool** is part of the undergraduate application process intended to ensure that the best applicants are offered admission.[120] Approximately 20–25% of undergraduate admissions are awarded through the Pool. Each college can place applicants in the Winter Pool. These applicants' applications are then considered by Admissions Tutors or Directors of Studies during the pool, which takes place over three days in January prior to the release of the university's admissions decisions.[121]\n\n\nFor each subject, colleges create an ordered list of the pooled applicants they seek to admit, and take turns choosing applicants. Colleges with specific student requirements, such as mature colleges and women-only colleges, are given priority over applicants eligible for their colleges. Some applicants are selected from the pool by the college that originally pooled them.[121] Once all the colleges have selected as many applicants as they need, the pool ends. Some applicants are then interviewed a second time by the colleges before final admissions decisions are made.\n\n\nColleges can pool any candidate, either because the college has no space but believes the applicant is strong enough to get a place, or because the college wants to compare that applicant to other pooled applicants. Most applicants in the pool are pooled at their original college's discretion, but some candidates meet the compulsory pooling criteria.[122]\n\n\nThere were, as of the 2020–21 admissions cycle, only two grounds for compulsory pooling. For post-qualified applicants, their achieved grades at A level or equivalent and, for applicants with overseas interviews, an interview score of at least eight is achieved in all interviews. The second criterion does not apply to medicine applicants.[123] Previously, AS-Level UMS have been used as pooling criteria, but after A-levels became linear this was discontinued.[123]\n\n\n\n\n\nCompulsory pooling criteria for post-qualified candidates\n| Qualification Type\n | Minimum grades\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A-Levels | A\\*A\\*A\\*\n | For science applicants, at least three A\\*s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| International Baccalaureate | 43 points overall with 776 at higher level or\n42 points overall with 777 at higher level\n | For science applicants, at least two 7s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| Scottish Advanced Highers | A1A1A1\n | For science applicants, at least 3 A1s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n\n\nAs of 2012, there is only one specifically identified category for pooled applicants, which is known as **S**, meaning that the application is in special need of reassessment. This is used when candidates whose initial interview scores are of questionable accuracy, such as when a candidate received very different scores from different interviewers, experienced technical issues with interviews conducted over the internet, or was impacted by significant extenuating circumstances such as illness or the loss of a family member.[123]\n\n\nPooled applicants who are fished by a college may be offered a place immediately or may be invited for an interview. In 2020, just 89 applicants were invited for second interviews, 34 of whom received offers of admission.[121]\n\n\nEach year, approximately 3,500 applicants receive offers from their preference college and a further 1,000 to 1,100 applicants are offered admission by another college through the pool. On average, one in five applicants is pooled and around one in four pooled applicants receives an offer of admission.[121]\n\n\nStatistics released by the university show that some colleges regularly receive particularly high numbers of applicants, and these colleges tend to take fewer applicants from the pool. Other colleges regularly draw a greater proportion of their undergraduate intake from the pool.[124]\n\n\n\n#### Access[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Percent of state school students at Cambridge and Oxford[125][126]\nPublic debate in the United Kingdom exists over whether admissions processes used at the University of Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit-based and fair, whether enough students from state schools are encouraged to apply, and whether these students are offered sufficient admission. In 2020–21, 71% of all successful applicants were from state schools[127] compared to approximately 93% of all students in the UK who attended state schools and 82% of post-16 students[128]). \n\n\nCritics have argued that the relative lower percent of state school applicants with the required grades for admission to Cambridge and Oxford has had a negative impact on Oxford and Cambridge's collective reputation, though both universities have encouraged pupils from state schools to apply to help redress the perceived imbalance.[129] Others counter that government pressure to increase state school admissions constitutes inappropriate social engineering.[130][131] The proportion of undergraduates drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years, constituting, as of 2020, 26% of total admissions among the university's 3,436 applicants from independent schools compared to 23% of the 9,237 applications from state schools.[132] Cambridge, together with Oxford and Durham, was among those universities that adopted formulae in 2009 to rate the GCSE performance of schools, using data from the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and took this into account when assessing university applicants.[133]\n\n\nWith the release of admissions figures, *The Guardian* reported in 2013 that ethnic minority candidates had lower success rates in individual subjects even when they had the same grades as white applicants. The university was criticised for what was seen as institutional discrimination against ethnic minority applicants in favour of white applicants. The university denied the claims of institutional discrimination, stating the figures did not take into account other variables.[134] A subsequent article reported that, in the years 2010 to 2012, ethnic minority applicants to medicine with 3 A\\* grades or higher were 20% less likely to gain admission than white applicants with similar grades. The university refused to provide figures for a wider range of subjects, claiming that assembling and releasing such information was excessively costly.[135]\n\n\nGiven the competitive nature of gaining admission to the University of Cambridge, a number of educational consultancies have emerged to offer support with the application process. Some claim they can improve chances for admission, though these claims have never been independently verified. None of these companies are affiliated with or endorsed by the University of Cambridge. The university informs applicants that all necessary information regarding the application process is publicly available through the university and none of these services is providing any insight not already publicly available to applicants.[136]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge has been criticised for admitting a lower percentage of Black students, though many apply. Of the 31 colleges at Cambridge, six of them admitted fewer than 10 Black or mixed race students between 2012 and 2016.[137] Similar criticism exists over a relatively lower admission rate for white working class applicants; in 2019, only 2% of admitted students were white working class.[138]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Cambridge created foundation courses for disadvantaged students.[139] While the usual entry requirements are A\\*AA in A-Levels, the one-year foundation course has 50 places for students who achieve BBB.[140] If successful on the course, students receive a recognised CertHE qualification and can progress to degrees in the arts, humanities, and social sciences at the university.[139] Candidates include those who have been in care, who are estranged from their families, who have missed significant periods of learning because of health issues, those from low-income backgrounds, and those from schools with few students attending universities.[139]\n\n\n\n### Teaching[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge School (intellectual history) and List of professorships at the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Results for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos are read aloud at Senate House and then tossed from the balcony in accordance with a tradition that began in the 18th century.\nThe University of Cambridge academic year is divided into three academic terms determined by the statutes of the university.[141] Michaelmas term lasts from October to December; the Lent term last from January to March; and the Easter term last from April to June.\n\n\nWithin these terms, undergraduate teaching takes place during eight-week periods called full terms. According to university statutes, it is a requirement during these periods that all students live within three miles of the Church of St Mary the Great, which this is known as keeping term. Students eligible for graduation must fulfill this condition for nine terms (three years) while pursuing a Bachelor of Arts or twelve terms (four years) when pursuing a Master of Science, engineering, or mathematics degree.[142]\n\n\nThese terms are shorter than those of many other British universities.[143] Undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacation holiday periods, which are referred to by the university as vacations rather than holidays; students vacate the premises during these periods but are still expected to be pursuing studies and assignments.\n\n\nThe Tripos exam involves a mixture of lectures organised by the university department) and supervised and organised by the colleges. Science subjects involve laboratory sessions organised by the departments. The relative importance of these methods of teaching varies according to the needs of the subject. Supervisions are typically weekly hour-long sessions in which small groups of students, usually between one and three students, who meet with a member of the teaching staff or with a doctoral student. Students are normally required to complete an assignment in advance of this supervision, which they then discuss with the supervisor during the session. The assignment is often an essay on a subject assigned by the supervisor, or a problem sheet set by the lecturer. Depending on the subject and college, students sometimes receive between one and four supervisory sessions each week.[144] This pedagogical system is often cited as being unique to Oxford, where supervisions are known as tutorials,[145] and Cambridge and is sometimes credited with the exceptional nature generally associated with the education at these two world-renowned universities.\n\n\nA tutor named William Farish developed the concept of grading students' work quantitatively at the University of Cambridge in 1792.[146]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Departments of the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge has research departments and teaching faculties in nearly every academic discipline, and ll research and lectures are conducted by university departments. The colleges are charged with giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extracurricular activities. During the 1990s, the University of Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several sites around the city, and major expansion continues.[147] From 2000 to 2006, the University of Cambridge maintained a research partnership with MIT in the United States, known as the Cambridge–MIT Institute, which was discontinued after evolving into what is now called the CMI Partnership Programme.\n\n\n\n### Graduation tradition and ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Graduands enter Senate House at a graduation ceremony.\n![](image)University officials leading the Vice-Chancellor's deputy into Senate House for graduation\nThe university's governing body Regent House manages and votes on graduations. A formal meeting of Regent House, known as a congregation, is held for this purpose,[148] which is typically the final act during which all university procedures for undergraduate and graduate students and other degrees are finalised. After degrees are approved, candidates for graduation are required to request their respective college presents them during commencement congregation.\n\n\nGraduates receiving an undergraduate degree wear the academic dress to which they are entitled prior to graduating; for example, most students becoming Bachelor of Arts graduates wear undergraduate gowns and not BA gowns. Graduates receiving a post-graduate degree wear the academic dress that they were entitled to before graduating if their first degree was also from the University of Cambridge; if their first degree was from another university, they wear the academic dress of the degree that they are about to receive. The BA gown without the strings is worn if the graduate is 24 years old or younger, and the MA gown without strings is worn if the graduate is 24 years old or older.[149] Graduates are presented their degrees in Senate House by each respective college in order of foundation or recognition by the university, except for the university's royal colleges.\n\n\nDuring the University of Cambridge's congregation ceremony, graduands are brought forth by the Praelector of their respective college, who takes them by the right hand and presents them to the vice-chancellor to receive the degree they have earned. The Praelector presents graduands with the following Latin statement, substituting \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\" with the name of the degree and substituting \"woman\" for \"man\" if the graduate is female:\n\n\n\n\n> \"*Dignissima domina, Domina Procancellaria et tota Academia praesento vobis hunc virum quem scio tam moribus quam doctrina esse idoneum ad gradum assequendum \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_; idque tibi fide mea praesto totique Academiae.*\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Latin statement translates in English as, \"Most worthy Vice-Chancellor and the whole University, I present to you this man whom I know to be suitable as much by character as by learning to proceed to the degree of \\_\\_\\_\\_; for which I pledge my faith to you and to the whole University.\"\n\n\nAfter presentation, the graduate is called by name and kneels before the vice-chancellor and proffers their hands to the vice-chancellor, who clasps them and then confers the degree through the following Latin statement, known as the Trinitarian formula (*in nomine Patris*), which may be omitted at the request of the graduand:\n\n\n\"*Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum \\_\\_\\_\\_, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti*, which translates in English as: \"By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of \\_\\_\\_\\_, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\"\n\n\nThe new graduate then rises, bows, and leaves the Senate House through the Doctor's door in Senate House Passage, where they receive their degree certificate.[148]\n\n\nFor the Cambridge Master of Arts, the degree is not awarded by merit of study, but by right following six years and one term after matriculation.\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Libraries of the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Category:Museums of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Trinity College's Wren Library\n![](image)Fitzwilliam Museum, the art and antiquities museum of the University of Cambridge\nThe University of Cambridge has 116 libraries.[150] Cambridge University Library, which holds over eight million volumes, is the central research library. It is a legal deposit library, which entitles it to request a free copy of every book published in the UK and Ireland.[151]\n\n\nIn addition to the University Library and its dependents, almost every faculty or department has a specialised library; for example, the History Faculty's Seeley Historical Library houses in excess of 100,000 books. Every college also maintains a library, partly for the purpose of undergraduate teaching; older colleges often possess many early books and manuscripts in a separate library. For example, Trinity College's Wren Library houses over 200,000 books printed before 1800 and Corpus Christi College's Parker Library has over 600 medieval manuscripts, representing one of the largest such collections in the world. Churchill Archives Centre on the campus of Churchill College houses the official papers of former British prime ministers Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher.\n\n\nThe university operates eight arts, cultural, and scientific museums, and a botanical garden.[152] Fitzwilliam Museum is the art and antiquities museum; Kettle's Yard is the university's contemporary art gallery; the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology houses the university's collections of local antiquities along with archaeological and ethnographic artefacts from around the world; Cambridge University Museum of Zoology houses a wide range of zoological specimens from around the world and is known for its iconic finback whale skeleton that hangs outside the museum. Cambridge University Museum of Zoology also holds specimens collected by Charles Darwin, an 1831 University of Cambridge alumnus. Other museums include the Museum of Classical Archaeology, Whipple Museum of the History of Science, Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences, the university's geology museum, which displays some of Darwin's geological specimens and equipment (Darwin had studied under Adam Sedgwick, and wrote \"I a geologist\" in a notebook in 1838), and Polar Museum, part of the Scott Polar Research Institute, which is dedicated to Captain Scott and his men and focuses on the exploration of the Polar Regions.\n\n\nCambridge University Botanic Garden, created in 1831, is the university's botanical garden.\n\n\n\n### Publishing and assessments[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge University Press\n\nThe university's publishing arm, Cambridge University Press & Assessment, is the oldest printer and publisher in the world and the second largest university press in the world.[153] [154] It is also the largest department of the university by financial income, reporting income above £800 million. [155]\n\n\nThe university established its Local Examination Syndicate in 1858, now known as Cambridge University Press & Assessment after its merger with Cambridge University Press. It is the largest assessment agency in Europe. Cambridge University Press & Assessment plays a leading role in researching, developing, and delivering assessments around the world.[156]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Awards and prizes of the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge issues a number of prestigious awards and prizes annually to accomplished University of Cambridge faculty and students. It also issues some awards to those of varying global academic accomplishment regardless of whether their recipient is affiliated with the University of Cambridge. Some of these awards and prizes rank among the world's most estimable academic and intellectual accomplishments. Among the most prominent of them are:\n\n\n\n* Adam Smith Prize, awarded annually to the university's top-performing student in economics\n* Adams Prize, awarded annually by University of Cambridge mathematics faculty to a UK resident in recognition of distinguished research in mathematics\n* Browne Medal, awarded annually to students who win the Latin and Greek poetry competition\n* Carus Greek Testament Prizes, a prize issued to winners of an annual competition of the university's undergraduate and graduate in Greek translation of New Testament passeges\n* Chancellor's Gold Medal, a prize issued to winners of the university's annual poetry competition\n* Porson Prize, a prize for students who develop the best Greek composition\n* Raymond Horton-Smith Prize, awarded annually to the University of Cambridge Medical School student for the best medical school thesis\n* Seatonian Prize, awarded annually for the best English language poem on a sacred subject\n* Senior Wrangler, awarded annually to the university's top performing student on the Mathematical Tripos described as \"the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in Britain.\"[26]\n* Thirlwall Prize, awarded every other year for the best essay about British literature or history\n* Thomas Bond Sprague Prize, awarded to the student with the best performing score on Part III of the Mathematical Tripos\n* Tyson Medal, awarded annually to the top astronomy student\n\n\n### Reputation and rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[157] | 1 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[158] | 3 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[159] | 3 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[160] | 4 |\n| *QS* (2025)[161] | 2 |\n| *THE* (2024)[162] | 5 |\n\n\n![](image)University of Cambridge's national league table performance over the past ten years\nThe University of Cambridge is routinely ranked among the world's top five universities, and has sometimes been ranked as the world's best. As of 2023, the University of Cambridge is ranked the second-best university in the world behind the MIT and the best university in Europe by *QS Rankings*.[163] *ARWU* ranks Cambridge the fourth-best university in the world as of 2023 behind Harvard, Stanford, and MIT.[164] *Times Higher Education* ranks Cambridge third-best in the world (tied with Stanford) in its 2023 rankings behind Oxford and Harvard.[165]\n\n\nIn April 2022, *QS Rankings* ranked Cambridge's programmes among the world's best. Cambridge's Arts and Humanities program is ranked second-best in the world. The University of Cambridge's Engineering and Technology program is ranked second-best in the world. Its Life Sciences and Medicine program is ranked fourth-best in the world. Its Natural Sciences program is ranked third-best in the world. Its Social Sciences and Management program is ranked fourth-best in the world.[166]\n\n\nIn 2011, *Times Higher Education* recognised the University of Cambridge as one of the world's six super brands in its \"World Reputation Rankings\" along with Berkeley, Harvard, MIT, Oxford, and Stanford.[167]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge has been highly ranked by most international and UK league tables. It was ranked the best university in the world by *QS World University Rankings* in both their 2010–11 and 2011–12 rankings.[168][169]\n\n\nIn 2006, a Thomson Scientific study reported that the University of Cambridge had the highest research paper output of any British university and ranked first in research production as assessed by total paper citation count in ten of 21 major British research fields.[170] An evidence-based study published the same year showed that the University of Cambridge won a larger proportion (6.6%) of total British research grants and contracts than any other university, ranking first in three out of four major measured discipline fields.[171]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Cambridge, List of organisations and institutions associated with the University of Cambridge, and List of social activities at the University of Cambridge\n\n### Formal halls and May balls[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The bridge over the River Cam at Clare College during the 2005 May Ball in Cambridge\n![](image)The University Centre main dining hall\nOne privilege of student life at the University of Cambridge is the opportunity to attend formal dinners at a student's respective college, known as Formal Hall that are held regularly during academic terms and daily at some of the university's colleges. During Formal Hall, students typically sit down for a meal in their gowns while fellows and sometimes guests eat separately at a so-called High Table. The beginning and end of the function is usually marked with grace, which is said in Latin. Special Formal Halls are organised for Christmas and the Commemoration of Benefactors.[172]\n\n\nAfter the exam period, May Week is held during which it is customary to celebrate by attending May Balls, which are all-night lavish parties held in the colleges where food, drinks, and entertainment are provided. So-called Suicide Sunday, the first day of May Week, is a popular date for garden parties.[173]\n\n\n\n### JCR and MCR[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to university-wide representation, students can participate in their own college student unions, which are known as Junior Combination Room (JCR) for undergraduates and Middle Combination Room (MCR) for post-graduates. These serve as a link between college staff and members and include officers elected annually between the fellow students; individual JCR and MCRs also report to Cambridge Students' Union, which offers training courses for some of the positions within the body.[174]\n\n\n\n### Societies[edit]\n\n\nMain page: Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Cambridge Union and Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club\n\n![](image)Stephen Fry at Cambridge Union, the world's oldest continuing running debate society\nNumerous student-run societies exist at the University of Cambridge designed to encourage students who share common passions or interests to periodically meet or discuss these interests. As of 2010[update], there were 751 registered societies at the university.[175] In addition to these, individual colleges often promote their own societies and sports teams.\n\n\nAlthough technically independent from the university, Cambridge Union, a globally-renowned debate organization and the oldest debate organization in the world, offers students high-level debate and public speaking experience.

CUSU previously represented all University students, and GU represented graduate students.[178][179]\n\n\nThe eight most important positions in Cambridge Students' Union are occupied by sabbatical officers.[180] In 2020, the sabbatical officers were elected with a turnout of 20.88% of the whole student body.[181]\n\n\nIn 2021, Cambridge Students' Union launched a petition opposing the financial collaboration between the university and the government of United Arab Emirates that was worth £400m. The Union cited a \"values gap\" and threat to \"academic freedom and institutional autonomy\" following the release of internal UAE documents. Citing UAE's history of violating international human rights laws, it warned that university staff were vulnerable under the partnership to repression by gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.[182]\n\n\nIn 2023, 72% of the Students' Union voted in favour of hosting talks regarding the removal of all animal products from cafes and canteens operated by the university's catering services. The students backed vegan food in response to threats to the climate and biodiversity. The vote is non-binding since the university controls the catering service.[183] After the vote, Darwin College decided to serve only vegan food at its May Ball in 2023.[184]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and academics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Cambridge people\n\nSee also: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Cambridge and Alumni Cantabrigienses\n\nOver the course of a history now exceeding 800 years, a number of University of Cambridge alumni and faculty have emerged as trailblazing thought leaders, innovators, and historical icons in their respective fields.

Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world's third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university's founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople.[10][11] The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*. In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter granted by King Henry III.\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge includes 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic departments, faculties, and other institutions organised into six schools. All of the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, managing their own personnel and policies, and all students are required to have a college affiliation within the university. Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge is centred on weekly small-group supervisions in the colleges with lectures, seminars, laboratory work, and occasionally further supervision provided by the central university faculties and departments.[12][13]\n\n\nThe university operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Cambridge's 116 libraries hold a total of approximately 16 million books, around nine million of which are in Cambridge University Library, a legal deposit library and one of the world's largest academic libraries. Cambridge alumni, academics, and affiliates have won 121 Nobel Prizes.[14] Among the university's notable alumni are 194 Olympic medal-winning athletes[15] and several historically iconic and transformational individuals in their respective fields, including Francis Bacon, Lord Byron, Oliver Cromwell, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking, John Maynard Keynes, John Milton, Vladimir Nabokov, Jawaharlal Nehru, Isaac Newton, Bertrand Russell, Alan Turing, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Cambridge\n\nPrior to the founding of the University of Cambridge in 1209, Cambridge and the area surrounding it already had developed a scholarly and ecclesiastical reputation due largely to the intellectual reputation and academic contributions of monks from the nearby bishopric church in Ely. The founding of the University of Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman, were hanged by town authorities without first consulting ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford's town authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. Enough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the new university's formation.[16][17][18]\n\n\nBy 1225, a chancellor of the university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231 established that rents in Cambridge were to be set *secundum consuetudinem universitatis*, according to the custom of the university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\nAfter Cambridge was described as a *studium generale* in a letter from Pope Nicholas IV in 1290,[20] and confirmed as such by Pope John XXII's 1318 papal bull,[21] it became common for researchers from other European medieval universities to visit Cambridge to study or give lecture courses.[20]\n\n\n\n### Foundation of the colleges[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Colleges of the University of Cambridge and Oxford and Cambridge Act 1571\n\n![](image)Emmanuel College Chapel\n![](image)Peterhouse, Cambridge's first college, founded in 1284\nThe colleges at the University of Cambridge were originally an incidental feature of the university; no college within the University of Cambridge is as old as the university itself. The colleges within the university were initially endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels, which were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, and they have left some traces, including the naming of Garret Hostel Lane and Garret Hostel Bridge, a street and bridge in Cambridge.[22]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge's first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, the Bishop of Ely. Multiple additional colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, and colleges continued being established through modern times, though there was a 204-year gap between the founding of Sidney Sussex in 1596 and that of Downing in 1800. The most recent college to be established is Robinson, which was built in the late 1970s. Most recently, in March 2010, Homerton College achieved full university college status, making it technically the university's newest full college.\n\n\nIn medieval times, many colleges were founded so that their members could pray for the souls of the founders. University of Cambridge colleges often were associated with chapels or abbeys. The colleges' focus began to shift in 1536, however, with the dissolution of the monasteries and Henry VIII's order that the university disband the canon law that governed the university's faculty[23] and stop teaching scholastic philosophy. In response, colleges changed their curricula from canon law to classics, the Bible, and mathematics.\n\n\nNearly a century later, the university found itself at the centre of a Protestant schism. Many nobles, intellectuals, and even commoners saw the Church of England as too similar to the Catholic Church and felt that it was being used by The Crown to usurp the counties' rightful powers. East Anglia emerged as the centre of what ultimately became the Puritan movement. In Cambridge, the Puritan movement was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine Hall, Sidney Sussex, and Christ's Colleges.[24] These colleges produced many non-conformist graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or preaching, some 20,000 Puritans who ultimately left England for New England and especially Massachusetts Bay Colony during the Great Migration decade of the 1630s, joining the Virginia colony and others in becoming settlers in some of the fledgling American colonies.\n\n\n\n### Mathematics and mathematical physics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lucasian Professor of Mathematics and Mathematical Tripos\n\nThe university quickly established itself as a global leader in the study of mathematics. The university's examination in mathematics, known as the Mathematical Tripos,[25] was initially compulsory for all undergraduates studying for the Bachelor of Arts degree, the most common degree first offered at Cambridge. From the time of Isaac Newton in the late 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained an especially strong emphasis on applied mathematics, and especially mathematical physics. Students awarded first class honours after completing the mathematics Tripos exam are called wranglers, and the top student among them is known as the Senior Wrangler, a position that has been described as \"the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in Britain.\"[26]\n\n\nThe Cambridge Mathematical Tripos is highly competitive and has helped produce some of the most famous names in British science, including James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Lord Rayleigh.[27] However, some famous students, such as G. H. Hardy, disliked the Tripos system, feeling that students were becoming too focused on accumulating high exam marks at the expense of the subject itself.\n\n\nPure mathematics at the University of Cambridge in the 19th century achieved great things, though it largely missed out on substantial developments in French and German mathematics. By the early 20th century, however, pure mathematical research at Cambridge reached the highest international standard, thanks largely to G. H. Hardy and his collaborators, J. E. Littlewood and Srinivasa Ramanujan. W. V. D. Hodge and others helped establish Cambridge as a global leader in geometry in the 1930s.\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge movement (philosophy)\n\n![](image)Selwyn College, founded in 1882\nThe Cambridge University Act 1856 formalised the university's organisational structure and introduced the study of many new subjects, including theology, history, and Modern languages.[28] Resources necessary for new courses in the arts, architecture, and archaeology were donated by Viscount Fitzwilliam of Trinity College, who also founded Fitzwilliam Museum in 1816.[29] In 1847, Prince Albert was elected the university's chancellor in a close contest with the Earl of Powis. As chancellor, Albert reformed university curricula beyond its initial focus on mathematics and classics, adding modern era history and the natural sciences. Between 1896 and 1902, Downing College sold part of its land to permit the construction of Downing Site, the university's grouping of scientific laboratories for the study of anatomy, genetics, and Earth sciences.[30] During this period, the New Museums Site was erected, including the Cavendish Laboratory, which has since moved to West Cambridge, and other departments for chemistry and medicine.[31]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge began to award PhD degrees in the first third of the 20th century; the first Cambridge PhD in mathematics was awarded in 1924.[32]\n\n\nThe university contributed significantly to the Allies' forces in World War I with 13,878 members of the university serving and 2,470 being killed in action during the war. Teaching, and the fees it earned, nearly came to a halt during World War I, and severe financial difficulties followed. As a result, the university received its first systematic state support in 1919, and a Royal commission was appointed in 1920 to recommend that the university (but not its colleges) begin receiving an annual grant.[33] Following World War II, the university experienced a rapid expansion in applications and enrollment, partly due to the success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.[34] This was not without controversies, however. For example, Cambridge researchers were accused in 2023 of helping to develop weapon systems for Iran.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Parliamentary representation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nSee also: Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge was one of only two universities to hold parliamentary seats in the Parliament of England and was later one of 19 represented in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The constituency was created by a Royal charter of 1603 and returned two members of parliament until 1950 when it was abolished by the Representation of the People Act 1948. The constituency was not a geographical area; rather, its electorate consisted of university graduates. Before 1918, the franchise was restricted to male graduates with a doctorate or MA degree.\n\n\n\n### Women's education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Newnham College, one of two female-only colleges at the university\nFor the first several centuries of its existence, as was the case broadly in England and the world, the University of Cambridge was only open to male students. The first colleges established for women were Girton College, founded by Emily Davies in 1869, Newnham College, founded by Anne Clough and Henry Sidgwick in 1872, Hughes Hall, founded in 1885 by Elizabeth Phillips Hughes as the Cambridge Teaching College for Women, Murray Edwards College, founded in 1954 by Rosemary Murray as New Hall, and Lucy Cavendish College, founded in 1965. Prior to ultimately being permitted admission to the university in 1948, female students were granted the right to take University of Cambridge exams beginning in the late 19th century.[36] Women were also allowed to study courses, take examinations, and have prior exam results recorded retroactively, dating back to 1881; for a brief period after the turn of the 20th century, this allowed the steamboat ladies to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[37]\n\n\nBeginning in 1921, women were awarded diplomas that conferred the title associated with the Bachelor of Arts degree. But since women were not yet admitted to the Bachelor of Arts degree program, they were excluded from the university's governance structure. Since University of Cambridge students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to few university colleges that had been established only for them. Darwin College, the first graduate college of the university, matriculated both male and female students from its inception in 1964 and elected a mixed fellowship. Undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare, and King's Colleges, began admitting women between 1972 and 1988. Among women's colleges at the university, Girton began admitting male students in 1979, and Lucy Cavendish began admitting men in 2021. But the other female-only colleges have remained female-only colleges as of 2023. As a result of St Hilda's College, Oxford ending its ban on male students in 2008, Cambridge is now the only remaining university in the United Kingdom with female-only colleges; the two female-only colleges at the university are Newnham and Murray Edwards.[38][39] As of the 2019–2020 academic year, the university's male to female enrollment, including post-graduates, was nearly balanced with its total student population being 53% male and 47% female.[40]\n\n\nIn 2018 and later years, the university has come under some criticism and faced legal challenges over alleged sexual harassment at the university.[41][42] In 2019, for example, former student Danielle Bradford, represented by sexual harassment lawyer Ann Olivarius, sued the university for its handling of her sexual misconduct complaint. \"I was told that I should think about it very carefully because making a complaint could affect my place in my department,\" Bradford alleged in 2019.[43] In 2020, hundreds of current and former students accused the university in a letter, citing \"a complete failure\" to deal with sexual misconduct complaints.[44]\n\n\n\n### Town and gown[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Town and gown\n\nFurther information: Away with the learning of clerks, away with it! and Silicon Fen\n\nThe relationship between the university and the city of Cambridge has sometimes been uneasy. The phrase town and gown continues to be employed to distinguish between Cambridge residents (town) and University of Cambridge students (gown), who historically wore academical dress. Ferocious rivalry between Cambridge's residents and university students have periodically erupted over the centuries. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, strong clashes led to attacks and looting of university properties as locals contested the privileges granted by the British government to the University of Cambridge's academic staff. Residents burned university property in Market Square to the famed rallying cry \"Away with the learning of clerks, away with it!\".[45] Following these events, the University of Cambridge's Chancellor was given special powers allowing him to prosecute criminals and reestablish order in the city. Attempts at reconciliation between the city's residents and students followed; in the 16th century, agreements were signed to improve the quality of streets and student accommodation around the city. However, this was followed by new confrontations when the plague reached Cambridge in 1630 and colleges refused to assist those affected by the disease by locking their sites.[46]\n\n\nSuch conflicts between Cambridge's residents and university students have largely disappeared since the 16th century, and the university has grown as a source of enormous employment and expanded wealth in Cambridge and the region.[47] The university also has proven a source of extraordinary growth in high tech and biotech start-ups and established companies and associated providers of services to these companies. The economic growth associated with the university's high tech and biotech growth has been labeled the Cambridge Phenomenon, and has included the addition of 1,500 new companies and as many as 40,000 new jobs added between 1960 and 2010, mostly at Silicon Fen, a business cluster launched by the university in the late 20th century.[48]\n\n\n\n### Myths, legends and traditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Cambridge legends\n\nSee also: Category:Terminology of the University of Cambridge\n\nFurther information: Nine Lessons and Carols and wooden spoon (award)\n\n![](image)Mathematical Bridge crossing River Cam at Queens' College\nPartly because of the University of Cambridge's extensive history, which now exceeds 800 years, the university has developed a large number of traditions, myths, and legends. Some are true, some are not, and some were true but have been discontinued but have been propagated nonetheless by generations of students and tour guides.\n\n\nOne such discontinued tradition is that of the wooden spoon, the prize awarded to the student with the lowest passing honours grade in the final examinations of the university's Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club at St John's College. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John's College. Since 1908, examination results have been published alphabetically within class rather than in strict order of merit, which made it difficult to ascertain the student with the lowest passing grade deserving of the spoon, leading to discontinuation of the tradition.\n\n\nEach Christmas Eve, The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, sung by the Choir of King's College, are broadcast globally on BBC World Service television and radio and syndicated to hundreds of additional radio stations in the U.S. and elsewhere. The radio broadcast has been a national Christmas Eve tradition since 1928, though the festival has existed since 1918 and the celebration itself originated even earlier at Truro Cathedral in Cornwall in 1880.[49] The first television broadcast of the festival was in 1954.[50][51]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nFront Court of King's College, founded in 1441 by King Henry VI\n\n## Locations and buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The entrance to the original Cavendish Laboratory on the New Museums Site\n![](image)The Faculty of Education building\n![](image)The Faculty of Law building on the Sidgwick Site\n### Buildings[edit]\n\n\nSee also: A Classical Adventure: The Architectural History of Downing College, Cambridge; Cambridge Medical School building; Cambridge Observatory; Cambridge University Library; Cambridge University Real Tennis Club; Fitzwilliam Museum; Goldie Boathouse; Lady Mitchell Hall; Old Schools; Senate House, Cambridge; Scott Polar Research Institute; University of Cambridge Sports Centre; and William Gates Building, Cambridge\n\nThe university occupies a central location within the city of Cambridge. University of Cambridge students represent approximately 20 percent of the town's population, which was 145,674 as of 2021, and contributes on whole to a lower age demographic in the city.[52]\n\n\nMost of the university's older colleges are located near the city centre through which River Cam flows. Students and others traditionally punt on the River Cam, which provides views of the university's buildings and campuses that surround the river.[53]\n\n\nNotable University of Cambridge buildings include King's College Chapel,[54] the history faculty building[55] designed by James Stirling, and the Cripps Building at St John's College.[56] The brickwork of several colleges is notable: Queens' College has some of the earliest patterned brickwork in England[57] and the brick walls of St John's College are examples of English bond, Flemish bond, and Running bond.[58]\n\n\n\n### Sites[edit]\n\n\nThe university is divided into several sites, which house the university's various departments, including:[59]\n\n\n\n* Addenbrooke's Hospital\n* Downing Site\n* Madingley/Gorton\n* New Museums Site\n* North West Cambridge Development\n* Old Addenbrooke's Site\n* Old Schools\n* Silver Street/Mill Lane\n* Sidgwick Site\n* West Cambridge\n\nThe university's School of Clinical Medicine is based in Addenbrooke's Hospital, where medical students undergo their three-year clinical placement period after obtaining their BA degree.[60] The West Cambridge site is undergoing a major expansion and will host new buildings and fields for university sports.[61] Since 1990, Cambridge Judge Business School, on Trumpington Street, provides management education courses and is consistently ranked among the top 20 business schools in the world by *Financial Times*.[62]\n\n\nGiven that the sites are in relative proximity and the area around Cambridge is reasonably flat, one of the favourite modes of transport for students is the bicycle; an estimated one-fifth of journeys in the city are made by bike, a figure enhanced by the fact that students are not permitted to hold car park permits except under special circumstances.[63]\n\n\n\n### Notable locations[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge and its constituent colleges include many notable locations, some of which are iconic or of historical, academic, religious, and cultural significance, including:\n\n\n\n* Bridge of Sighs, Cambridge\n* Cambridge University Botanic Garden\n* Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge\n* Downing Site\n* Fenner's\n* Goldie Boathouse\n* King's College Chapel, Cambridge\n* Lady Mitchell Hall\n* Mathematical Bridge\n* Nevile's Court, Trinity College, Cambridge\n* Sidgwick Site\n* St Bene't's Church\n* The Backs\n* Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge\n* West Cambridge\n\n## Organisation and administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of institutions of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)View over Trinity College, Gonville and Caius College, Trinity Hall, and Clare College towards King's College Chapel seen from St John's College Chapel on the left. In front of King's College Chapel is the Senate House.\nCambridge is a collegiate university, which means that its colleges are self-governing and independent, each with its own property, endowments, and income. Most colleges bring together academics and students from a broad range of disciplines. Each faculty, school, or department at the university includes academics affiliated with differing colleges.\n\n\nThe college faculties are responsible for giving lectures, arranging seminars, performing research, and determining the syllabi for teaching, all of which is overseen by the university's general board. Together with the central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor, the college faculties make up the University of Cambridge. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels by the university. The Cambridge University Library is the university's largest and primary library. Squire Law Library is the primary library for the university's students of law. Individual colleges each maintain a multi-discipline library designed for each college's respective undergraduates.\n\n\nThe university is legally structured as an exempt charity and a common law corporation. Its corporate titles include the Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge.[64]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Gonville and Caius College\n![](image)Margaret Wileman Building at Hughes Hall\n![](image)The President's Lodge at Queens' College\n![](image)Bridge of Sighs over the River Cam at St John's College\nThe colleges are self-governing institutions with their own endowments and property, each founded as components of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. The colleges' importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees but undergraduates receive their overall academic supervision through small group teaching sessions, which often include just one student within the colleges, though in many cases students go to other colleges for supervision if the teaching fellows at their college do not specialise in a student's particular area of academic focus. Each college appoints its own teaching staff and fellows, both of whom are members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university standards and regulations.\n\n\nCambridge has 31 colleges, two of which, Murray Edwards and Newnham, admit women only. The other colleges are mixed. Darwin was the first college to admit both men and women. In 1972, Churchill, Clare, and King's were the first previously all-male colleges to admit female undergraduates. In 1988, Magdalene became the last all-male college to accept women.[65] Clare Hall and Darwin admit only postgraduates, and Hughes Hall, St Edmund's, and Wolfson admit only mature undergraduate and graduate students who are 21 years or older on the date of their matriculation. Lucy Cavendish, which was previously a women-only mature college, began admitting both men and women in 2021.[66] All other colleges admit both undergraduate and postgraduate students without any age restrictions.\n\n\nColleges are not required to admit students in all subjects; some colleges choose not to offer subjects such as architecture, art history, or theology, but most offer a complete range of academic specialties and related courses. Some colleges maintain a relative strength and associated reputation for expertise in certain academic disciplines. Churchill, for example, has a reputation for its expertise and focus on the sciences and engineering, in part due to the requirement made by Winston Churchill upon the college's founding that 70% of its students studied mathematics, engineering, and the sciences.[67] Other colleges have more informal academic focus and even demonstrated ideological focus, such as King's, which is known for its left-wing political orientation,[68] and Robinson and Churchill, both of which have a reputation for academic focus on sustainability and environmentalism.[69]\n\n\nCosts to students for room and board vary considerably from college to college.[70][71] Similarly, the investment in student education by each college at the university varies widely between the colleges.[72]\n\n\nThree theological colleges at the university, Westcott House, Westminster College, and Ridley Hall Theological College, are members of the Cambridge Theological Federation and associated in partnership with university.[73]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge's 31 colleges are:[74]\n\n\n\n1. ![Christ's College heraldic shield](image) Christ's\n2. ![Churchill College heraldic shield](image) Churchill\n3. ![Clare College heraldic shield](image) Clare\n4. ![Clare Hall heraldic shield](image) Clare Hall\n5. ![Corpus Christi heraldic shield](image) Corpus Christi\n6. ![Darwin College heraldic shield](image) Darwin\n7. ![Downing College heraldic shield](image) Downing\n8. ![Emmanuel College heraldic shield](image) Emmanuel\n9. ![Fitzwilliam College heraldic shield](image) Fitzwilliam\n10. ![](image) Girton\n11. ![Gonville and Caius College heraldic shield](image) Gonville & Caius\n12. ![](image) Homerton\n13. ![Hughes Hall heraldic shield](image) Hughes Hall\n14. ![Jesus College heraldic shield](image) Jesus\n15. ![King's College heraldic shield](image) King's\n16. ![Lucy Cavendish College heraldic shield](image) Lucy Cavendish\n17. ![Magdalene College heraldic shield](image) Magdalene\n18. ![](image) Murray Edwards\n19. ![Newnham College heraldic shield](image) Newnham\n20. ![Pembroke College heraldic shield](image) Pembroke\n21. ![Peterhouse coat of arms](image) Peterhouse\n22. ![Queens' College heraldic shield](image) Queens'\n23. ![Robinson College heraldic shield](image) Robinson\n24. ![Selwyn College heraldic shield](image) Selwyn\n25. ![Sidney Sussex College heraldic shield](image) Sidney Sussex\n26. ![St Catharine's College heraldic shield](image) St Catharine's\n27. ![](image) St Edmund's\n28. ![St John's College heraldic shield](image) St John's\n29. ![Trinity College coat of arms](image) Trinity\n30. ![Trinity Hall heraldic shield](image) Trinity Hall\n31. ![Wolfson College Crest](image) Wolfson\n\n### Schools, faculties and departments[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of institutions of the University of Cambridge § Schools, Faculties, and Departments\n\n![](image)Institute of Continuing Education at Madingley Hall\n![](image)Old Schools (left) houses the university's administrative offices.\nIn addition to the 31 colleges, the university maintains over 150 departments, faculties, schools, syndicates, and other academic institutions.[75] Members of these are usually members of one of the colleges, and responsibility for the entire academic programme of the university is divided among them.\n\n\nThe university has a department dedicated to providing continuing education, the Institute of Continuing Education, which is based primarily in Madingley Hall, a 16th-century manor house in Cambridgeshire. Its award-bearing programmes include both undergraduate certificates and part-time master's degrees.[76]\n\n\nA school in the University of Cambridge is a broad administrative grouping of related faculties and other units. Each has an elected supervisory body known as a Council, composed of representatives of the various constituent bodies. The University of Cambridge maintains six such schools:[77]\n\n\n\n* Arts and Humanities\n* Biological Sciences\n* Clinical Medicine\n* Humanities and Social Sciences\n* Physical Sciences\n* Technology\n\nTeaching and research at the university is organised by faculties. The faculties have varying organisational substructures that partly reflect their respective histories and the university's operational needs, which may include a number of departments and other institutions. A small number of bodies called syndicates hold responsibility for teaching and research, including for the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, the University Press, and the University Library.\n\n\n\n### Central administration[edit]\n\n\n#### Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of chancellors of the University of Cambridge and List of vice-chancellors of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Regent House officers following a July 2014 graduation ceremony\n![](image)Faculty of Divinity at the university\nThe Chancellor of the university is limitless term position that is mainly ceremonial and is held currently by David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville, who succeeded the Duke of Edinburgh following his retirement on his 90th birthday in June 2011. Lord Sainsbury was nominated by the nomination board.[78][79][80][81] The election took place on 14 and 15 October 2011[81] with Sainsbury taking 2,893 of the 5,888 votes cast, and winning on the election's first count.\n\n\nThe current acting vice-chancellor is Anthony Freeling, who was appointed in 2022[82] While the Chancellor's office is ceremonial, the Vice-Chancellor serves as the university's *de facto* principal administrative officer. The university's internal governance is carried out almost entirely by Regent House augmented by some external representation from the Audit Committee and four external members of the University's Council.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Senate and the Regent House[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Light show on Senate House for the 800th anniversary of the university's founding\n![](image)Old Court at Clare College\nThe university Senate consists of all holders of the MA or higher degrees and is responsible for electing the Chancellor and the High Steward. Until 1950 when the Cambridge University constituency was abolished, it was also responsible for electing two members of the House of Commons. Prior to 1926, the university Senate was the university's governing body, fulfilling the functions that Regent House has provided since.[84] Regent House is the university's governing body, a direct democracy comprising all resident senior members of the university and the colleges, the Chancellor, the High Steward, the Deputy High Steward, and the Commissary.[85] Public representatives of Regent House are the two Proctors, elected to serve for one year terms upon their nominations by the colleges.\n\n\n\n#### Council and General Board[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senate House Passage in the snow with Senate House on the right and Gonville and Caius College on the left\nAlthough the University Council is the university's principal executive and policy-making body, the Council reports to, and is held accountable by, Regent House through a variety of checks and balances. The council is obliged to advise Regent House on matters of general concern to the university, which it does by publishing notices to the *Cambridge University Reporter*, the university's official journal.[86] In March 2008, Regent House voted to increase from two to four the number of external members on the council,[87][88] and this was approved by Her Majesty the Queen in July 2008.[89]\n\n\nThe General Board of the Faculties is responsible for the university's academic and educational policies[90] and is accountable to the council for its management of these affairs.\n\n\nFaculty boards are accountable to the general board; other boards and syndicates are accountable either to the general board or to the council. Under this organizational structure, the university's various arms are kept under supervision of both the central administration and Regent House.[91]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n#### Benefactions and fundraising[edit]\n\n\nIn the fiscal year ending 31 July 2019, the central university, excluding colleges, reported total income of £2.192 billion, of which £592.4 million was from research grants and contracts.[4] In the decade prior to 2019, the University of Cambridge reported an average of £271m a year in philanthropic donations.[4]\n\n\nThe university maintains multiple scholarship programs. The Stormzy Scholarship for Black UK Students covers tuition costs for two students and maintenance grants for up to four years.[92]\n\n\nIn 2000, Bill Gates of Microsoft donated US$210 million through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to endow Gates Scholarships for students from outside the United Kingdom pursuing post-graduate study at Cambridge.[93]\n\n\nIn October 2021, the university suspended its £400m collaboration with the United Arab Emirates, citing allegations that UAE was involved in illegal hacking of the university's computer and storage systems using NSO Group's Pegasus software. UAE also was behind the leak of over 50,000 phone numbers, including hundreds belonging to British citizens. Stephen Toope, the university's outgoing Vice-Chancellor, said the decision to suspend its collaboration with UAE also was a result of additional revelations about UAE's Pegasus software hacking.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Bonds[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge borrowed £350 million in October 2012 by issuing 40-year security bonds,[95] whose interest rate is approximately 0.6 percent higher than the British government's 40-year bond.[96]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations and memberships[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, the International Alliance of Research Universities, and it is part of the so-called golden triangle of research intensive universities in the south of England.[97] It is also closely linked to the high tech business cluster known as Silicon Fen and is part of Cambridge University Health Partners, Europe's largest academic health science centre.\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics\n|  | 2022[98] | 2021[99] | 2020[100] | 2019[101] | 2018[102] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 22,470\n | 22,795\n | 20,426\n | 19,359\n | 18,378\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 18.9\n | 18.7\n | 23.1\n | 24.3\n | 24.8\n |\n| **Enrols** | 3,544\n | 3,660\n | 3,997\n | 3,528\n | 3,465\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 83.6\n | 85.9\n | 84.9\n | 75.2\n | 76.0\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 6.34\n | 6.23\n | 5.11\n | 5.49\n | 5.30\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[103] | —\n | 209\n | 207\n | 205\n | 212\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition\n| Domicile[104] and Ethnicity[105] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 47%\n | 47 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[b] | 21%\n | 21 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 23%\n | 23 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[106][107] |\n| Female | 50%\n | 50 |\n| Private School | 30%\n | 30 |\n| Low Participation Areas[c] | 5%\n | 5 |\n\n\n#### Process[edit]\n\n\n![Peterhouse Old Court](image)Peterhouse Old Court\n![](image)Great Court of Trinity College, dating back to the 16th Century\nAdmission to the University of Cambridge is competitive. In 2018–2019, for instance, 18.8% of applicants were admitted.[108][109] In 2021, Cambridge introduced an over-subscription clause to its offers of admission, which also permits the university to withdraw acceptances if too many students meet its selective entrance criteria. The clause can be invoked in the event of circumstances outside the reasonable control of the university. The clause was introduced following a record number of A-level pupils obtained the highest grades from teacher assessment, which was introduced due to the cancellation of A-level examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.[110][111]\n\n\nThe university's standard offer for most courses is set at A\\*AA,[112][113] with A\\*A\\*A for science courses, or equivalent in other examination systems, e.g. 7,6,6 or 7,7,6 in IB. Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, an interview process was introduced as a component of consideration for admission. Interviews are performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors including potential for original thinking and creativity.[114] For exceptional candidates, a matriculation offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above. Sutton Trust maintains that the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge recruit disproportionately from eight schools, which account for 1,310 Oxbridge places over three years contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[115]\n\n\nStrong applicants who are not successful in being admitted to their chosen college at the university may be placed in the Winter Pool, where they can be considered for admission to other university colleges, which maintains consistency throughout the colleges, some of which receive more applicants than others.\n\n\nUndergraduate applications are processed through UCAS, and the deadline for their submission currently is mid-October in the year before prior to beginning. Until the 1980s, candidates for all subjects were required to take special entrance examinations,[116] which have since been replaced by additional tests for some subjects, such as the Thinking Skills Assessment and Cambridge Law Test.[117] The university has at times considered reintroducing an admissions exam for all subjects.[118]\n\n\nGraduate admission is first decided by the faculty or department responsible for the applicant's respective academic subject. An offer of acceptance effectively guarantees admission to the university, though not necessarily the applicant's preferred choice of college.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Winter pool[edit]\n\n\nThe **Winter Pool** or **inter-College Pool** is part of the undergraduate application process intended to ensure that the best applicants are offered admission.[120] Approximately 20–25% of undergraduate admissions are awarded through the Pool. Each college can place applicants in the Winter Pool. These applicants' applications are then considered by Admissions Tutors or Directors of Studies during the pool, which takes place over three days in January prior to the release of the university's admissions decisions.[121]\n\n\nFor each subject, colleges create an ordered list of the pooled applicants they seek to admit, and take turns choosing applicants. Colleges with specific student requirements, such as mature colleges and women-only colleges, are given priority over applicants eligible for their colleges. Some applicants are selected from the pool by the college that originally pooled them.[121] Once all the colleges have selected as many applicants as they need, the pool ends. Some applicants are then interviewed a second time by the colleges before final admissions decisions are made.\n\n\nColleges can pool any candidate, either because the college has no space but believes the applicant is strong enough to get a place, or because the college wants to compare that applicant to other pooled applicants. Most applicants in the pool are pooled at their original college's discretion, but some candidates meet the compulsory pooling criteria.[122]\n\n\nThere were, as of the 2020–21 admissions cycle, only two grounds for compulsory pooling. For post-qualified applicants, their achieved grades at A level or equivalent and, for applicants with overseas interviews, an interview score of at least eight is achieved in all interviews. The second criterion does not apply to medicine applicants.[123] Previously, AS-Level UMS have been used as pooling criteria, but after A-levels became linear this was discontinued.[123]\n\n\n\n\n\nCompulsory pooling criteria for post-qualified candidates\n| Qualification Type\n | Minimum grades\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A-Levels | A\\*A\\*A\\*\n | For science applicants, at least three A\\*s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| International Baccalaureate | 43 points overall with 776 at higher level or\n42 points overall with 777 at higher level\n | For science applicants, at least two 7s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| Scottish Advanced Highers | A1A1A1\n | For science applicants, at least 3 A1s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n\n\nAs of 2012, there is only one specifically identified category for pooled applicants, which is known as **S**, meaning that the application is in special need of reassessment. This is used when candidates whose initial interview scores are of questionable accuracy, such as when a candidate received very different scores from different interviewers, experienced technical issues with interviews conducted over the internet, or was impacted by significant extenuating circumstances such as illness or the loss of a family member.[123]\n\n\nPooled applicants who are fished by a college may be offered a place immediately or may be invited for an interview. In 2020, just 89 applicants were invited for second interviews, 34 of whom received offers of admission.[121]\n\n\nEach year, approximately 3,500 applicants receive offers from their preference college and a further 1,000 to 1,100 applicants are offered admission by another college through the pool. On average, one in five applicants is pooled and around one in four pooled applicants receives an offer of admission.[121]\n\n\nStatistics released by the university show that some colleges regularly receive particularly high numbers of applicants, and these colleges tend to take fewer applicants from the pool. Other colleges regularly draw a greater proportion of their undergraduate intake from the pool.[124]\n\n\n\n#### Access[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Percent of state school students at Cambridge and Oxford[125][126]\nPublic debate in the United Kingdom exists over whether admissions processes used at the University of Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit-based and fair, whether enough students from state schools are encouraged to apply, and whether these students are offered sufficient admission. In 2020–21, 71% of all successful applicants were from state schools[127] compared to approximately 93% of all students in the UK who attended state schools and 82% of post-16 students[128]). \n\n\nCritics have argued that the relative lower percent of state school applicants with the required grades for admission to Cambridge and Oxford has had a negative impact on Oxford and Cambridge's collective reputation, though both universities have encouraged pupils from state schools to apply to help redress the perceived imbalance.[129] Others counter that government pressure to increase state school admissions constitutes inappropriate social engineering.[130][131] The proportion of undergraduates drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years, constituting, as of 2020, 26% of total admissions among the university's 3,436 applicants from independent schools compared to 23% of the 9,237 applications from state schools.[132] Cambridge, together with Oxford and Durham, was among those universities that adopted formulae in 2009 to rate the GCSE performance of schools, using data from the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and took this into account when assessing university applicants.[133]\n\n\nWith the release of admissions figures, *The Guardian* reported in 2013 that ethnic minority candidates had lower success rates in individual subjects even when they had the same grades as white applicants. The university was criticised for what was seen as institutional discrimination against ethnic minority applicants in favour of white applicants. The university denied the claims of institutional discrimination, stating the figures did not take into account other variables.[134] A subsequent article reported that, in the years 2010 to 2012, ethnic minority applicants to medicine with 3 A\\* grades or higher were 20% less likely to gain admission than white applicants with similar grades. The university refused to provide figures for a wider range of subjects, claiming that assembling and releasing such information was excessively costly.[135]\n\n\nGiven the competitive nature of gaining admission to the University of Cambridge, a number of educational consultancies have emerged to offer support with the application process. Some claim they can improve chances for admission, though these claims have never been independently verified. None of these companies are affiliated with or endorsed by the University of Cambridge. The university informs applicants that all necessary information regarding the application process is publicly available through the university and none of these services is providing any insight not already publicly available to applicants.[136]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge has been criticised for admitting a lower percentage of Black students, though many apply. Of the 31 colleges at Cambridge, six of them admitted fewer than 10 Black or mixed race students between 2012 and 2016.[137] Similar criticism exists over a relatively lower admission rate for white working class applicants; in 2019, only 2% of admitted students were white working class.[138]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Cambridge created foundation courses for disadvantaged students.[139] While the usual entry requirements are A\\*AA in A-Levels, the one-year foundation course has 50 places for students who achieve BBB.[140] If successful on the course, students receive a recognised CertHE qualification and can progress to degrees in the arts, humanities, and social sciences at the university.[139] Candidates include those who have been in care, who are estranged from their families, who have missed significant periods of learning because of health issues, those from low-income backgrounds, and those from schools with few students attending universities.[139]\n\n\n\n### Teaching[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge School (intellectual history) and List of professorships at the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Results for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos are read aloud at Senate House and then tossed from the balcony in accordance with a tradition that began in the 18th century.\nThe University of Cambridge academic year is divided into three academic terms determined by the statutes of the university.[141] Michaelmas term lasts from October to December; the Lent term last from January to March; and the Easter term last from April to June.\n\n\nWithin these terms, undergraduate teaching takes place during eight-week periods called full terms. According to university statutes, it is a requirement during these periods that all students live within three miles of the Church of St Mary the Great, which this is known as keeping term. Students eligible for graduation must fulfill this condition for nine terms (three years) while pursuing a Bachelor of Arts or twelve terms (four years) when pursuing a Master of Science, engineering, or mathematics degree.[142]\n\n\nThese terms are shorter than those of many other British universities.[143] Undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacation holiday periods, which are referred to by the university as vacations rather than holidays; students vacate the premises during these periods but are still expected to be pursuing studies and assignments.\n\n\nThe Tripos exam involves a mixture of lectures organised by the university department) and supervised and organised by the colleges. Science subjects involve laboratory sessions organised by the departments. The relative importance of these methods of teaching varies according to the needs of the subject. Supervisions are typically weekly hour-long sessions in which small groups of students, usually between one and three students, who meet with a member of the teaching staff or with a doctoral student. Students are normally required to complete an assignment in advance of this supervision, which they then discuss with the supervisor during the session. The assignment is often an essay on a subject assigned by the supervisor, or a problem sheet set by the lecturer. Depending on the subject and college, students sometimes receive between one and four supervisory sessions each week.[144] This pedagogical system is often cited as being unique to Oxford, where supervisions are known as tutorials,[145] and Cambridge and is sometimes credited with the exceptional nature generally associated with the education at these two world-renowned universities.\n\n\nA tutor named William Farish developed the concept of grading students' work quantitatively at the University of Cambridge in 1792.[146]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Departments of the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge has research departments and teaching faculties in nearly every academic discipline, and ll research and lectures are conducted by university departments. The colleges are charged with giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extracurricular activities. During the 1990s, the University of Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several sites around the city, and major expansion continues.[147] From 2000 to 2006, the University of Cambridge maintained a research partnership with MIT in the United States, known as the Cambridge–MIT Institute, which was discontinued after evolving into what is now called the CMI Partnership Programme.\n\n\n\n### Graduation tradition and ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Graduands enter Senate House at a graduation ceremony.\n![](image)University officials leading the Vice-Chancellor's deputy into Senate House for graduation\nThe university's governing body Regent House manages and votes on graduations. A formal meeting of Regent House, known as a congregation, is held for this purpose,[148] which is typically the final act during which all university procedures for undergraduate and graduate students and other degrees are finalised. After degrees are approved, candidates for graduation are required to request their respective college presents them during commencement congregation.\n\n\nGraduates receiving an undergraduate degree wear the academic dress to which they are entitled prior to graduating; for example, most students becoming Bachelor of Arts graduates wear undergraduate gowns and not BA gowns. Graduates receiving a post-graduate degree wear the academic dress that they were entitled to before graduating if their first degree was also from the University of Cambridge; if their first degree was from another university, they wear the academic dress of the degree that they are about to receive. The BA gown without the strings is worn if the graduate is 24 years old or younger, and the MA gown without strings is worn if the graduate is 24 years old or older.[149] Graduates are presented their degrees in Senate House by each respective college in order of foundation or recognition by the university, except for the university's royal colleges.\n\n\nDuring the University of Cambridge's congregation ceremony, graduands are brought forth by the Praelector of their respective college, who takes them by the right hand and presents them to the vice-chancellor to receive the degree they have earned. The Praelector presents graduands with the following Latin statement, substituting \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\" with the name of the degree and substituting \"woman\" for \"man\" if the graduate is female:\n\n\n\n\n> \"*Dignissima domina, Domina Procancellaria et tota Academia praesento vobis hunc virum quem scio tam moribus quam doctrina esse idoneum ad gradum assequendum \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_; idque tibi fide mea praesto totique Academiae.*\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Latin statement translates in English as, \"Most worthy Vice-Chancellor and the whole University, I present to you this man whom I know to be suitable as much by character as by learning to proceed to the degree of \\_\\_\\_\\_; for which I pledge my faith to you and to the whole University.\"\n\n\nAfter presentation, the graduate is called by name and kneels before the vice-chancellor and proffers their hands to the vice-chancellor, who clasps them and then confers the degree through the following Latin statement, known as the Trinitarian formula (*in nomine Patris*), which may be omitted at the request of the graduand:\n\n\n\"*Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum \\_\\_\\_\\_, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti*, which translates in English as: \"By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of \\_\\_\\_\\_, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\"\n\n\nThe new graduate then rises, bows, and leaves the Senate House through the Doctor's door in Senate House Passage, where they receive their degree certificate.[148]\n\n\nFor the Cambridge Master of Arts, the degree is not awarded by merit of study, but by right following six years and one term after matriculation.\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Libraries of the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Category:Museums of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Trinity College's Wren Library\n![](image)Fitzwilliam Museum, the art and antiquities museum of the University of Cambridge\nThe University of Cambridge has 116 libraries.[150] Cambridge University Library, which holds over eight million volumes, is the central research library. It is a legal deposit library, which entitles it to request a free copy of every book published in the UK and Ireland.[151]\n\n\nIn addition to the University Library and its dependents, almost every faculty or department has a specialised library; for example, the History Faculty's Seeley Historical Library houses in excess of 100,000 books. Every college also maintains a library, partly for the purpose of undergraduate teaching; older colleges often possess many early books and manuscripts in a separate library. For example, Trinity College's Wren Library houses over 200,000 books printed before 1800 and Corpus Christi College's Parker Library has over 600 medieval manuscripts, representing one of the largest such collections in the world. Churchill Archives Centre on the campus of Churchill College houses the official papers of former British prime ministers Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher.\n\n\nThe university operates eight arts, cultural, and scientific museums, and a botanical garden.[152] Fitzwilliam Museum is the art and antiquities museum; Kettle's Yard is the university's contemporary art gallery; the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology houses the university's collections of local antiquities along with archaeological and ethnographic artefacts from around the world; Cambridge University Museum of Zoology houses a wide range of zoological specimens from around the world and is known for its iconic finback whale skeleton that hangs outside the museum. Cambridge University Museum of Zoology also holds specimens collected by Charles Darwin, an 1831 University of Cambridge alumnus. Other museums include the Museum of Classical Archaeology, Whipple Museum of the History of Science, Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences, the university's geology museum, which displays some of Darwin's geological specimens and equipment (Darwin had studied under Adam Sedgwick, and wrote \"I a geologist\" in a notebook in 1838), and Polar Museum, part of the Scott Polar Research Institute, which is dedicated to Captain Scott and his men and focuses on the exploration of the Polar Regions.\n\n\nCambridge University Botanic Garden, created in 1831, is the university's botanical garden.\n\n\n\n### Publishing and assessments[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge University Press\n\nThe university's publishing arm, Cambridge University Press & Assessment, is the oldest printer and publisher in the world and the second largest university press in the world.[153] [154] It is also the largest department of the university by financial income, reporting income above £800 million. [155]\n\n\nThe university established its Local Examination Syndicate in 1858, now known as Cambridge University Press & Assessment after its merger with Cambridge University Press. It is the largest assessment agency in Europe. Cambridge University Press & Assessment plays a leading role in researching, developing, and delivering assessments around the world.[156]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Awards and prizes of the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge issues a number of prestigious awards and prizes annually to accomplished University of Cambridge faculty and students. It also issues some awards to those of varying global academic accomplishment regardless of whether their recipient is affiliated with the University of Cambridge. Some of these awards and prizes rank among the world's most estimable academic and intellectual accomplishments. Among the most prominent of them are:\n\n\n\n* Adam Smith Prize, awarded annually to the university's top-performing student in economics\n* Adams Prize, awarded annually by University of Cambridge mathematics faculty to a UK resident in recognition of distinguished research in mathematics\n* Browne Medal, awarded annually to students who win the Latin and Greek poetry competition\n* Carus Greek Testament Prizes, a prize issued to winners of an annual competition of the university's undergraduate and graduate in Greek translation of New Testament passeges\n* Chancellor's Gold Medal, a prize issued to winners of the university's annual poetry competition\n* Porson Prize, a prize for students who develop the best Greek composition\n* Raymond Horton-Smith Prize, awarded annually to the University of Cambridge Medical School student for the best medical school thesis\n* Seatonian Prize, awarded annually for the best English language poem on a sacred subject\n* Senior Wrangler, awarded annually to the university's top performing student on the Mathematical Tripos described as \"the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in Britain.\"[26]\n* Thirlwall Prize, awarded every other year for the best essay about British literature or history\n* Thomas Bond Sprague Prize, awarded to the student with the best performing score on Part III of the Mathematical Tripos\n* Tyson Medal, awarded annually to the top astronomy student\n\n\n### Reputation and rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[157] | 1 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[158] | 3 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[159] | 3 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[160] | 4 |\n| *QS* (2025)[161] | 2 |\n| *THE* (2024)[162] | 5 |\n\n\n![](image)University of Cambridge's national league table performance over the past ten years\nThe University of Cambridge is routinely ranked among the world's top five universities, and has sometimes been ranked as the world's best. As of 2023, the University of Cambridge is ranked the second-best university in the world behind the MIT and the best university in Europe by *QS Rankings*.[163] *ARWU* ranks Cambridge the fourth-best university in the world as of 2023 behind Harvard, Stanford, and MIT.[164] *Times Higher Education* ranks Cambridge third-best in the world (tied with Stanford) in its 2023 rankings behind Oxford and Harvard.[165]\n\n\nIn April 2022, *QS Rankings* ranked Cambridge's programmes among the world's best. Cambridge's Arts and Humanities program is ranked second-best in the world. The University of Cambridge's Engineering and Technology program is ranked second-best in the world. Its Life Sciences and Medicine program is ranked fourth-best in the world. Its Natural Sciences program is ranked third-best in the world. Its Social Sciences and Management program is ranked fourth-best in the world.[166]\n\n\nIn 2011, *Times Higher Education* recognised the University of Cambridge as one of the world's six super brands in its \"World Reputation Rankings\" along with Berkeley, Harvard, MIT, Oxford, and Stanford.[167]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge has been highly ranked by most international and UK league tables. It was ranked the best university in the world by *QS World University Rankings* in both their 2010–11 and 2011–12 rankings.[168][169]\n\n\nIn 2006, a Thomson Scientific study reported that the University of Cambridge had the highest research paper output of any British university and ranked first in research production as assessed by total paper citation count in ten of 21 major British research fields.[170] An evidence-based study published the same year showed that the University of Cambridge won a larger proportion (6.6%) of total British research grants and contracts than any other university, ranking first in three out of four major measured discipline fields.[171]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Cambridge, List of organisations and institutions associated with the University of Cambridge, and List of social activities at the University of Cambridge\n\n### Formal halls and May balls[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The bridge over the River Cam at Clare College during the 2005 May Ball in Cambridge\n![](image)The University Centre main dining hall\nOne privilege of student life at the University of Cambridge is the opportunity to attend formal dinners at a student's respective college, known as Formal Hall that are held regularly during academic terms and daily at some of the university's colleges. During Formal Hall, students typically sit down for a meal in their gowns while fellows and sometimes guests eat separately at a so-called High Table. The beginning and end of the function is usually marked with grace, which is said in Latin. Special Formal Halls are organised for Christmas and the Commemoration of Benefactors.[172]\n\n\nAfter the exam period, May Week is held during which it is customary to celebrate by attending May Balls, which are all-night lavish parties held in the colleges where food, drinks, and entertainment are provided. So-called Suicide Sunday, the first day of May Week, is a popular date for garden parties.[173]\n\n\n\n### JCR and MCR[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to university-wide representation, students can participate in their own college student unions, which are known as Junior Combination Room (JCR) for undergraduates and Middle Combination Room (MCR) for post-graduates. These serve as a link between college staff and members and include officers elected annually between the fellow students; individual JCR and MCRs also report to Cambridge Students' Union, which offers training courses for some of the positions within the body.[174]\n\n\n\n### Societies[edit]\n\n\nMain page: Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Cambridge Union and Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club\n\n![](image)Stephen Fry at Cambridge Union, the world's oldest continuing running debate society\nNumerous student-run societies exist at the University of Cambridge designed to encourage students who share common passions or interests to periodically meet or discuss these interests. As of 2010[update], there were 751 registered societies at the university.[175] In addition to these, individual colleges often promote their own societies and sports teams.\n\n\nAlthough technically independent from the university, Cambridge Union, a globally-renowned debate organization and the oldest debate organization in the world, offers students high-level debate and public speaking experience. Drama societies include the Amateur Dramatic Club (ADC) and the comedy club Footlights, whose alumni include many well-known show business personalities. The university's Chamber Orchestra, composed entirely of university students, offers a range of orchestra programs, including symphonies.\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain page: Category:Sport at the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Cambridge University Cricket Club, List of Cambridge University Boat Race crews, and Cambridge University Polo Club\n\n![](image)The boathouse of the Cambridge University Boat Club\nRowing is one of the most popular sports at the University of Cambridge, and there are competitions between colleges, notably the bumps races. The University of Cambridge's rowing competition against Oxford is known as Boat Race. Varsity matches against Oxford also exist in other sports, including cricket, rugby, chess, and tiddlywinks. Athletes who representing the university in a varsity match are entitled to a Blue or a Half Blue, depending on the sport and other criteria.[176]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge Sports Centre opened in August 2013. Phase one included a sports hall, a fitness suite, a strength and conditioning room, a multi-purpose room, and Eton and Rugby fives courts. Phase two of its development included five glass-backed squash courts and a team training room. Future phases include indoor and outdoor tennis courts and a swimming pool.[177]\n\n\nThe university also has an athletic track at Wilberforce Road, an indoor cricket school, and Fenner's, the cricket ground for Cambridge University Cricket Club.\n\n\nThe Hawks' Club is a private members' club for the university's leading sportsmen.[176] The Ospreys are the equivalent female club.\n\n\n\n### Student newspapers and radio[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Publications associated with the University of Cambridge\n\nCambridge's oldest student newspaper is *Varsity*. Established in 1947, notable figures who have edited the newspaper include Jeremy Paxman, BBC media editor Amol Rajan, and *Vogue* international editor Suzy Menkes. The student newspaper also has featured the early writings of Zadie Smith, who appeared in *Varsity*'s literary anthology offshoot *The Mays*, Robert Webb, Tristram Hunt, and Tony Wilson.\n\n\n*Varsity* has a circulation of 9,000 and is the only student publication published weekly. News stories from *Varsity* have appeared in *The Guardian*, *The Times*, *The Sunday Times*, *The Daily Telegraph*, *The Independent*, and *i*.\n\n\nOther student publications include *The Cambridge Student*, which is funded by Cambridge Students' Union and is published fortnightly, *The Tab*, and *The Mays* Founded by two University of Cambridge students in 2009, *The Tab* is an online media outlet featuring light-hearted features content. *The Mays* is a literary anthology including student prose, poetry, and visual art from both University of Cambridge and Oxford students. Founded in 1992 by three Cambridge students, the anthology publishes once a year and is overseen by Varsity Publications Ltd., the same body responsible for *Varsity*. Another literary journal, *Notes*, is published roughly twice per term. Additionally, many colleges have their own student-run publications.\n\n\nThe student radio station, Cam FM, is run jointly by University of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin University students. The station holds an FM licence (frequency 97.2 MHz), and hosts a mixture of music, talk, and sports shows.\n\n\n\n### Student Union[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambridge Students' Union\n\nAll students at the University of Cambridge are represented by Cambridge Students' Union, which was founded in 2020 as a merger of two student unions, Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU) and the Graduate Union (GU). CUSU previously represented all University students, and GU represented graduate students.[178][179]\n\n\nThe eight most important positions in Cambridge Students' Union are occupied by sabbatical officers.[180] In 2020, the sabbatical officers were elected with a turnout of 20.88% of the whole student body.[181]\n\n\nIn 2021, Cambridge Students' Union launched a petition opposing the financial collaboration between the university and the government of United Arab Emirates that was worth £400m. The Union cited a \"values gap\" and threat to \"academic freedom and institutional autonomy\" following the release of internal UAE documents. Citing UAE's history of violating international human rights laws, it warned that university staff were vulnerable under the partnership to repression by gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.[182]\n\n\nIn 2023, 72% of the Students' Union voted in favour of hosting talks regarding the removal of all animal products from cafes and canteens operated by the university's catering services. The students backed vegan food in response to threats to the climate and biodiversity. The vote is non-binding since the university controls the catering service.[183] After the vote, Darwin College decided to serve only vegan food at its May Ball in 2023.[184]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and academics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Cambridge people\n\nSee also: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Cambridge and Alumni Cantabrigienses\n\nOver the course of a history now exceeding 800 years, a number of University of Cambridge alumni and faculty have emerged as trailblazing thought leaders, innovators, and historical icons in their respective fields.

There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2] making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.[2][11][12] It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge.[13] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*.\n\n\nThe University of Oxford is made up of thirty-nine semi-autonomous constituent colleges, four permanent private halls, and a range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions.[14] All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college.[15] It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided in a predominantly centralised fashion.\n\n\nOxford operates the Ashmolean Museum, the world's oldest university museum; Oxford University Press, the largest university press in the world; and the largest academic library system nationwide.[16] In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2022, the university had a total consolidated income of £2.78 billion, of which £711.4 million was from research grants and contracts.[4]\n\n\nOxford has educated a wide range of notable alumni, including 30 prime ministers of the United Kingdom and many heads of state and government around the world.[17] As of October 2022,[update] 73 Nobel Prize laureates, 4 Fields Medalists, and 6 Turing Award winners have matriculated, worked, or held visiting fellowships at the University of Oxford, while its alumni have won 160 Olympic medals.[18] Oxford is the home of numerous scholarships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, one of the oldest international graduate scholarship programmes.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Oxford\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Merton College's Mob Quad, the oldest quadrangle of the university, constructed between 1288 and 1378\n![](image)In 1605, Oxford was still a walled city, but several colleges had been built outside the city walls (north is at the bottom on this map).\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Balliol College, one of the university's oldest constituent colleges\nThe University of Oxford's foundation date is unknown.[19] It is known that teaching at Oxford existed in some form as early as 1096, but it is unclear when the university came into being.[2] The scholar Theobald of Étampes lectured at Oxford in the early 1100s.\n\n\nIt grew quickly from 1167 when English students returned from the University of Paris.[2] The historian Gerald of Wales lectured to such scholars in 1188, and the first known foreign scholar, Emo of Friesland, arrived in 1190. The head of the university had the title of chancellor from at least 1201, and the masters were recognised as a *universitas* or corporation in 1231.[2][20] The university was granted a royal charter in 1248 during the reign of King Henry III.[21]\n\n\nAfter disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled from the violence to Cambridge, later forming the University of Cambridge.[13][22]\n\n\nThe students associated together on the basis of geographical origins, into two 'nations', representing the North (*northerners* or *Boreales*, who included the English people from north of the River Trent and the Scots) and the South (*southerners* or *Australes*, who included English people from south of the Trent, the Irish and the Welsh).[23][24] In later centuries, geographical origins continued to influence many students' affiliations when membership of a college or hall became customary in Oxford. In addition, members of many religious orders, including Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites and Augustinians, settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century, gained influence and maintained houses or halls for students.[25] At about the same time, private benefactors established colleges as self-contained scholarly communities. Among the earliest such founders were William of Durham, who in 1249 endowed University College,[25] and John Balliol, father of a future King of Scots; Balliol College bears his name.[23] Another founder, Walter de Merton, a Lord Chancellor of England and afterwards Bishop of Rochester, devised a series of regulations for college life;[26][27] Merton College thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford,[28] as well as at the University of Cambridge. Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.[25]\n\n\nIn 1333–1334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III.[29] Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### Renaissance period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An engraving of Christ Church, Oxford, 1742\nThe new learning of the Renaissance greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were William Grocyn, who contributed to the revival of Greek language studies,[32] and John Colet, the noted biblical scholar.[33]\n\n\nWith the English Reformation and the breaking of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai.[34] The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.[35]\n\n\nIn 1636,[36] William Laud, the chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury, codified the university's statutes. These, to a large extent, remained its governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the University Press, and he made significant contributions to the Bodleian Library, the main library of the university. From the beginnings of the Church of England as the established church until 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to receive the BA degree from the university and \"dissenters\" were only permitted to receive the MA in 1871.[37]\n\n\nThe university was a centre of the Royalist party during the English Civil War (1642–1649), while the town favoured the opposing Parliamentarian cause.[38]\n\n\n\n![Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College](image)Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College\nWadham College, founded in 1610, was the undergraduate college of Sir Christopher Wren.\n\n\nWren was part of a brilliant group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s, the Oxford Philosophical Club, which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. This group, which has at times been linked with Boyle's \"Invisible College\" held regular meetings at Wadham under the guidance of the college's Warden, John Wilkins, and the group formed the nucleus that went on to found the Royal Society.[39]\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\n#### Students[edit]\n\n\nBefore reforms in the early 19th century, the curriculum at Oxford was notoriously narrow and impractical. Sir Spencer Walpole, a historian of contemporary Britain and a senior government official, had not attended any university. He said, \"Few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.\" He quoted the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: \"The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.\"[40] Nevertheless, Walpole argued:\n\n\n\n\n>  Among the many deficiencies attending a university education there was, however, one good thing about it, and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.[41]\n> \n> \n\n\nOut of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (59% as Anglican clergy). Out of the students who matriculated in 1870, 59% were sons of professionals (25% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (42% as Anglican clergy).[42][43]\n\n\nM. C. Curthoys and H. S. Jones argue that the rise of organised sport was one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton, Winchester, Shrewsbury, and Harrow.[44]\n\n\nAll students, regardless of their chosen area of study, were required to spend (at least) their first year preparing for a first-year examination that was heavily focused on classical languages. Science students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with Greek language study removed from their required courses. This concept of a Bachelor of Science had been adopted at other European universities (London University had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the \"natural science preliminary\" was recognized as a qualifying part of the first year examination.[45]\n\n\nAt the start of 1914, the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students. During the First World War, many undergraduates and fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 virtually all fellows were in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent of the pre-war total.[46] The University Roll of Service records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed.[47] Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War were on the Allied side; there is a remarkable memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces, bearing the inscription, 'In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914–1918'. During the war years the university buildings became hospitals, cadet schools and military training camps.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Reforms[edit]\n\n\nTwo parliamentary commissions in 1852 issued recommendations for Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.[48][49]\n\n\nThe system of separate honour schools for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and Literae Humaniores.[50] Schools of \"Natural Sciences\" and \"Law, and Modern History\" were added in 1853.[50] By 1872, the last of these had split into \"Jurisprudence\" and \"Modern History\". Theology became the sixth honour school.[51] In addition to these B.A. Honours degrees, the postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) was, and still is, offered.[52]\n\n\nThe mid-19th century saw the impact of the Oxford Movement (1833–1845), led among others by the future Cardinal John Henry Newman. \n\n\nAdministrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for religious dissent, and the establishment of four women's colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies.\n\n\nThe University of Oxford began to award doctorates for research in the first third of the 20th century. The first Oxford DPhil in mathematics was awarded in 1921.[53]\n\n\nThe list of distinguished scholars at the University of Oxford is long and includes many who have made major contributions to politics, the sciences, medicine, and literature. As of October 2022, 73 Nobel laureates and more than 50 world leaders have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.[17]\n\n\n\n### Women's education[edit]\n\n\nFirst two women's colleges\n![](image)\nLady Margaret Hall, founded in 1878\n![](image)\nSomerville College, founded in 1879\n\nThe university passed a statute in 1875 allowing examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level;[54] for a brief period in the early 1900s, this allowed the \"steamboat ladies\" to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[55] In June 1878, the *Association for the Education of Women* (AEW) was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, T. H. Green and Edward Stuart Talbot. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group founded Lady Margaret Hall in 1878, while T. H. Green founded the non-denominational Somerville College in 1879.[56] Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville opened their doors to their first 21 students (12 from Somerville, 9 from Lady Margaret Hall) in 1879, who attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop.[54] There were also 25 women students living at home or with friends in 1879, a group which evolved into the Society of Oxford Home-Students and in 1952 into St Anne's College.[57][58]\n\n\nThese first three societies for women were followed by St Hugh's (1886)[59] and St Hilda's (1893).[60] All of these colleges later became coeducational, starting with Lady Margaret Hall and St Anne's in 1979,[61][62] and finishing with St Hilda's, which began to accept male students in 2008.[63] In the early 20th century, Oxford and Cambridge were widely perceived to be bastions of male privilege,[64] however the integration of women into Oxford moved forward during the First World War. In 1916 women were admitted as medical students on a par with men, and in 1917 the university accepted financial responsibility for women's examinations.[46]\n\n\nOn 7 October 1920 women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees.[65] In 1927 the university's dons created a quota that limited the number of female students to a quarter that of men, a ruling which was not abolished until 1957.[54] However, during this period Oxford colleges were single sex, so the number of women was also limited by the capacity of the women's colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women's colleges were given full collegiate status.[66]\n\n\nIn 1974, Brasenose, Jesus, Wadham, Hertford and St Catherine's became the first previously all-male colleges to admit women.[67][68] The majority of men's colleges accepted their first female students in 1979,[68] with Christ Church following in 1980,[69] and Oriel becoming the last men's college to admit women in 1985.[70] Most of Oxford's graduate colleges were founded as coeducational establishments in the 20th century, with the exception of St Antony's, which was founded as a men's college in 1950 and began to accept women only in 1962.[71] By 1988, 40% of undergraduates at Oxford were female;[72] in 2016, 45% of the student population, and 47% of undergraduate students, were female.[73][74]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Oxford announced that starting the following academic year, history students may choose to sit a take-home exam in some courses, with the intention that this will equalise rates of firsts awarded to women and men at Oxford.[75] That same summer, maths and computer science tests were extended by 15 minutes, in a bid to see if female student scores would improve.[76][77]\n\n\nThe detective novel *Gaudy Night* by Dorothy L. Sayers, herself one of the first women to gain an academic degree from Oxford, is largely set in the all-female Shrewsbury College, Oxford (based on Sayers' own Somerville College[78]), and the issue of women's education is central to its plot. Social historian and Somerville College alumna Jane Robinson's book *Bluestockings: A Remarkable History of the First Women to Fight for an Education* gives a very detailed and immersive account of this history.[79]\n\n\n\n## Buildings and sites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*Scrollable image*.

heavily in new facilities at the laboratory in recent years.\n![](image)Sheldonian Theatre, built by Christopher Wren between 1664 and 1668, hosts the university's Congregation and its concerts and degree ceremonies.\nThe university is a \"city university\" in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. The Science Area, in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) Radcliffe Observatory Quarter in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges' sites are of similar size to these areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIconic university buildings include the Radcliffe Camera, the Sheldonian Theatre used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the Examination Schools, where examinations and some lectures take place. The University Church of St Mary the Virgin was used for university ceremonies before the construction of the Sheldonian. Christ Church Cathedral uniquely serves as both a college chapel and as a cathedral.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2012–2013, the university built the controversial one-hectare (400 m × 25 m) Castle Mill development of 4–5-storey blocks of student flats overlooking Cripley Meadow and the historic Port Meadow, blocking views of the spires in the city centre.[80] The development has been likened to building a \"skyscraper beside Stonehenge\".[81]\n\n\n\n### Parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Summer in the Botanic Garden\nThe University Parks are a 70-acre (28 ha) parkland area in the northeast of the city, near Keble College, Somerville College and Lady Margaret Hall. It is open to the public during daylight hours. \n\n\nThe Botanic Garden on the High Street is the oldest botanic garden in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on 1.8 ha (4+1⁄2 acres). It is one of the most diverse yet compact major collections of plants in the world and includes representatives of over 90% of the higher plant families. The Harcourt Arboretum is a 130-acre (53 ha) site six miles (9.7 km) south of the city that includes native woodland and 67 acres (27 hectares) of meadow. The 1,000-acre (4.0 km2) Wytham Woods are owned by the university and used for research in zoology and climate change.[82]\n\n\nThere are also various college-owned open spaces open to the public, including Bagley Wood and most notably Christ Church Meadow.[83]\n\n\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Departments of the University of Oxford\nColleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Central governance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wellington Square has become synonymous with the university's central administration.\nThe university's formal head is the Chancellor, currently Lord Patten of Barnes, though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figurehead and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of Convocation, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.[84]\n\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor, currently Irene Tracey,[6] is the *de facto* head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. \n\n\nTwo university proctors, elected annually on a rotating basis from any two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student discipline and complaints, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings.[85] The university's professors are collectively referred to as the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the Chichele Professorships and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy. \n\n\nThe University of Oxford is only a \"public university\" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.[86]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Tom Quad, Christ Church\n![](image)Main Quad, Worcester College\nTo be a member of the university, all students, and most academic staff, must also be a member of a college or hall. There are thirty-nine colleges of the University of Oxford and four permanent private halls (PPHs), each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities.[15] Not all colleges offer all courses, but they generally cover a broad range of subjects.\n\n\nThe colleges are:\n\n\n\n* All Souls College\n* Balliol College\n* Brasenose College\n* Christ Church\n* Corpus Christi College\n* Exeter College\n* Green Templeton College\n* Harris Manchester College\n* Hertford College\n* Jesus College\n* Keble College\n* Kellogg College\n* Lady Margaret Hall\n* Linacre College\n* Lincoln College\n* Magdalen College\n* Mansfield College\n* Merton College\n* New College\n* Nuffield College\n* Oriel College\n* Pembroke College\n* The Queen's College\n* Reuben College\n* St Anne's College\n* St Antony's College\n* St Catherine's College\n* St Cross College\n* St Edmund Hall\n* St Hilda's College\n* St Hugh's College\n* St John's College\n* St Peter's College\n* Somerville College\n* Trinity College\n* University College\n* Wadham College\n* Wolfson College\n* Worcester College\n\nThe permanent private halls were founded by different Christian denominations. One difference between a college and a PPH is that whereas colleges are governed by the fellows of the college, the governance of a PPH resides, at least in part, with the corresponding Christian denomination. The four current PPHs are:\n\n\n\n* Blackfriars Hall\n* Campion Hall\n* Regent's Park College\n* Wycliffe Hall\n\n\nThe PPHs and colleges join as the Conference of Colleges, which represents the common concerns of the several colleges of the university, to discuss matters of shared interest and to act collectively when necessary, such as in dealings with the central university.[87][88] The Conference of Colleges was established as a recommendation of the Franks Commission in 1965.[89]\n\n\nTeaching members of the colleges (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons, although the term is rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments. \n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dining hall at Christ Church; the hall is an important feature of the typical Oxford college, providing a place to dine and socialise.\nIn 2017–18, the university had an income of £2,237m; key sources were research grants (£579.1m) and academic fees (£332.5m).[90] The colleges had a total income of £492.9m.[91]\n\n\nWhile the university has a larger annual income and operating budget, the colleges have a larger aggregate endowment: over £6.4bn compared to the university's £1.2bn.[4] The central University's endowment, along with some of the colleges', is managed by the university's wholly-owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007.[92] The university used to maintain substantial investments in fossil fuel companies.[93] However, in April 2020, the university committed to divest from direct investments in fossil fuel companies and to require indirect investments in fossil fuel companies be subjected to the Oxford Martin Principles.[94][95]\n\n\nThe total assets of the colleges of £6.3 billion also exceed total university assets of £4.1 billion.[91][90] The college figure does not reflect all the assets held by the colleges as their accounts do not include the cost or value of many of their main sites or heritage assets such as works of art or libraries.[96]\n\n\nThe university was one of the first in the UK to raise money through a major public fundraising campaign, the Campaign for Oxford. The current campaign, its second, was launched in May 2008 and is entitled \"Oxford Thinking – The Campaign for the University of Oxford\".[97] This is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure;[98] having passed its original target of £1.25 billion in March 2012, the target was raised to £3 billion.[99] The campaign had raised a total of £2.8 billion by July 2018.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Funding criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe university has faced criticism for some of its sources of donations and funding. In 2017, attention was drawn to historical donations including All Souls College receiving £10,000 from slave trader Christopher Codrington in 1710,[100] and Oriel College having receiving taken £100,000 from the will of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes in 1902.[101][102] In 1996 a donation of £20 million was received from Wafic Saïd who was involved in the Al-Yammah arms deal,[103][104] and taking £150 million from the US billionaire businessman Stephen A. Schwarzman in 2019.[105] The university has defended its decisions saying it \"takes legal, ethical and reputational issues into consideration\".\n\n\nThe university has also faced criticism, as noted above, over its decision to accept donations from fossil fuel companies having received £21.8 million from the fossil fuel industry between 2010 and 2015[106] and £18.8 million between 2015 and 2020.[107][108]\n\n\nThe university accepted £6 million from The Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust in 2021. Former racing driver Max Mosley said he set up the trust \"to house the fortune he inherited\" from his father,[109] Oswald Mosley, who was founder of two far right groups: Union Movement and the British Union of Fascists.[110]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nOxford is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, and the International Alliance of Research Universities. It is also a core member of the Europaeum and forms part of the \"golden triangle\" of highly research intensive and elite English universities.[111]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Admission[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics\n|  | 2022[112] | 2021[113] | 2020[114] | 2019[115] | 2018[116] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 23,819\n | 24,338\n | 23,414\n | 23,020\n | 21,515\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 15.3\n | 14.6\n | 16.8\n | 16.9\n | 17.8\n |\n| **Enrols** | 3,271\n | 3,298\n | 3,695\n | 3,280\n | 3,309\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 89.7\n | 92.8\n | 94.0\n | 84.3\n | 86.2\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 7.28\n | 7.38\n | 6.34\n | 7.02\n | 6.50\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[117] | —\n | 205\n | 201\n | 200\n | 205\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition (2022)\n| Domicile[118] and Ethnicity[119] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 50%\n | 50 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[a] | 16%\n | 16 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 25%\n | 25 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[120][121] |\n| Female | 54%\n | 54 |\n| Private Schools | 31%\n | 31 |\n| Low Participation Areas[b] | 6%\n | 6 |\n\n\n![](image)Percentage of state-school students at Oxford and Cambridge[122][123]\nIn common with most British universities, prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.[124] The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit undergraduates disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[125]\n\n\nTo allow a more personalised judgement of students, who might otherwise apply for both, undergraduate applicants are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year. The only exceptions are applicants for organ scholarships[126] and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree.[127]\nOxford has the lowest offer rate of all Russell Group universities.[128]\n\n\nMost applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges. For undergraduates, these colleges work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the university regardless of their college preferences. For postgraduates, all applicants who receive an offer from the university are guaranteed a college place, even if they do not receive a place at their chosen college.[129]\n\n\nUndergraduate shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most undergraduate applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. \n\n\nUndergraduate offers are sent out in early January, with each offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receives an offer from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make \"open offers\" to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until A Level results day in August.[130][131]\n\n\nThe university has come under criticism for the number of students it accepts from private schools;[132] for instance, Laura Spence's rejection from the university in 2000 led to widespread debate.[133] In 2016, the University of Oxford gave 59% of offers to UK students to students from state schools, while about 93% of all UK pupils and 86% of post-16 UK pupils are educated in state schools.[134][135][136] However, 64% of UK applicants were from state schools and the university notes that state school students apply disproportionately to oversubscribed subjects.[137] The proportion of students coming from state schools has been increasing. From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%.[138] Oxford University spends over £6 million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.[134]\n\n\nIn 2018 the university's annual admissions report revealed that eight of Oxford's colleges had accepted fewer than three black applicants in the past three years.[139] Labour MP David Lammy said, \"This is social apartheid and it is utterly unrepresentative of life in modern Britain.\"[140] In 2020, Oxford had increased its proportion of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students to record levels.[141][142] The number of BAME undergraduates accepted to the university in 2020 rose to 684 students, or 23.6% of the UK intake, up from 558 or 22% in 2019; the number of Black students was 106 (3.7% of the intake), up from 80 students (3.2%).[142][143] UCAS data also showed that Oxford is more likely than comparable institutions to make offers to ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged pupils.[141]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and degrees[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Degrees of the University of Oxford, List of professorships at the University of Oxford, and Undergraduate education at University of Oxford\n\nUndergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1–4 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week's work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight-week academic terms: Michaelmas, Hilary and Trinity.[144] (These are officially known as 'Full Term': 'Term' is a lengthier period with little practical significance.) Internally, the weeks in a term begin on Sundays, and are referred to numerically, with the initial week known as \"first week\", the last as \"eighth week\" and with the numbering extended to refer to weeks before and after term (for example \"noughth week\" precedes term).[145] Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week. These teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities,[146] and their total duration amounts to less than half the year. However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).\n\n\nResearch degrees at the master's and doctoral level are conferred in all subjects studied at graduate level at the university.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Scholarships and financial support[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhodes House, home to the awarding body for Rhodes Scholarships, is often considered as the world's most prestigious scholarship.\nThere are many opportunities for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate, with a total possible grant of £10,235 over a 3-year degree. In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships.[147] Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities.[148] The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by Oxford University Press in association with colleges and other partnership awards.[149][150] In 2016, Oxford University announced that it is to run its first free online economics course as part of a \"massive open online course\" (Mooc) scheme, in partnership with a US online university network.[151] The course available is called 'From Poverty to Prosperity: Understanding Economic Development'.\n\n\nStudents successful in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with scholarships and exhibitions, normally the result of a long-standing endowment, although since the introduction of tuition fees the amounts of money available are purely nominal. Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; \"commoners\" (originally those who had to pay for their \"commons\", or food and lodging) are restricted to a short, sleeveless garment. The term \"scholar\" in relation to Oxford therefore has a specific meaning as well as the more general meaning of someone of outstanding academic ability. In previous times, there were \"noblemen commoners\" and \"gentlemen commoners\", but these ranks were abolished in the 19th century. \"Closed\" scholarships, available only to candidates who fitted specific conditions such as coming from specific schools, were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s.[152]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Libraries of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Clarendon Building, home to many senior Bodleian Library staff, previously housed the university's own central administration.\nThe university maintains the largest university library system in the UK,[16] and, with over 11 million volumes housed on 120 miles (190 km) of shelving, the Bodleian group is the second-largest library in the UK, after the British Library. The Bodleian is a legal deposit library, which means that it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK. As such, its collection is growing at a rate of over three miles (five kilometres) of shelving every year.[153]\n\n\nThe buildings referred to as the university's main research library, The Bodleian, consist of the original Bodleian Library in the Old Schools Quadrangle, founded by Sir Thomas Bodley in 1598 and opened in 1602,[154] the Radcliffe Camera, the Clarendon Building, and the Weston Library. A tunnel underneath Broad Street connects these buildings, with the Gladstone Link, which opened to readers in 2011, connecting the Old Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera.\n\n\nThe Bodleian Libraries group was formed in 2000, bringing the Bodleian Library and some of the subject libraries together.[155] It now comprises 28[156] libraries, a number of which have been created by bringing previously separate collections together, including the Sackler Library, Law Library, Social Science Library and Radcliffe Science Library.[155] Another major product of this collaboration has been a joint integrated library system, OLIS (**O**xford **L**ibraries **I**nformation **S**ystem),[157] and its public interface, **SOLO** (**S**earch **O**xford **L**ibraries **O**nline), which provides an electronic catalogue covering all member libraries, as well as the libraries of individual colleges and other faculty libraries, which are not members of the group but do share cataloguing information.[158]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duke Humfrey's Library in the Bodleian Library\nA new book depository opened in South Marston, Swindon, in October 2010,[159] and recent building projects include the remodelling of the New Bodleian building, which was renamed the Weston Library when it reopened in 2015.[160][161] The renovation is designed to better showcase the library's various treasures (which include a Shakespeare First Folio and a Gutenberg Bible) as well as temporary exhibitions.\n\n\nThe Bodleian engaged in a mass-digitisation project with Google in 2004.[162][163] Notable electronic resources hosted by the Bodleian Group include the *Electronic Enlightenment Project*, which was awarded the 2010 Digital Prize by the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies.[164]\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Museums of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Interior of the Pitt Rivers Museum\nOxford maintains a number of museums and galleries, open for free to the public. The Ashmolean Museum, founded in 1683, is the oldest museum in the UK, and the oldest university museum in the world.[165] It holds significant collections of art and archaeology, including works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Turner, and Picasso, as well as treasures such as the Scorpion Macehead, the Parian Marble and the Alfred Jewel. It also contains \"The Messiah\", a pristine Stradivarius violin, regarded by some as one of the finest examples in existence.[166]\n\n\nThe University Museum of Natural History holds the university's zoological, entomological and geological specimens. It is housed in a large neo-Gothic building on Parks Road, in the university's Science Area.[167][168] Among its collection are the skeletons of a *Tyrannosaurus rex* and *Triceratops*, and the most complete remains of a dodo found anywhere in the world. It also hosts the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science, currently held by Marcus du Sautoy.[169]\n\n\nAdjoining the Museum of Natural History is the Pitt Rivers Museum, founded in 1884, which displays the university's archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items. It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General Augustus Pitt Rivers stipulated that the university establish a lectureship in anthropology.[170]\n\n\nThe Museum of the History of Science is housed on Broad Street in the world's oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building.[171] It contains 15,000 artefacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science. In the Faculty of Music on St Aldate's is the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. Christ Church Picture Gallery holds a large collection of old master paintings and drawings.[172]\n\n\n\n### Publishing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Oxford University Press\n\nThe Oxford University Press is the world's second oldest and currently the largest university press by the number of publications.[173] More than 6,000 new books are published annually,[174] including many reference, professional, and academic works (such as the *Oxford English Dictionary*, the *Concise Oxford English Dictionary*, the *Oxford World's Classics*, the *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography*, and the *Concise Dictionary of National Biography*).\n\n\n\n### Rankings and reputation[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[175] | 2 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[176] | 2 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[177] | 2 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[178] | 7 |\n| *QS* (2025)[179] | 3 |\n| *THE* (2024)[180] | 1 |\n\n\n![](image)University of Oxford's national league table performance over the past ten years\nOxford is regularly ranked within the top five universities in the world and is currently ranked first in the world in the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*,[181][182] as well as the Forbes's World University Rankings.[183] It held the number one position in the *Times Good University Guide* for eleven consecutive years,[184] and the medical school has also maintained first place in the \"Clinical, Pre-Clinical & Health\" table of the *Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings* for the past seven consecutive years.[185] In 2021, it ranked sixth among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[186] The *THE* has also recognised Oxford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Stanford.[187] The university is fifth worldwide on the *US News* ranking.[188] Its Saïd Business School came 13th in the world in *Financial Times* *Global MBA Ranking*.[189]\n\n\nOxford was ranked 13th in the world in 2022 by the Nature Index, which measures the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[190][191] It is ranked fifth best university worldwide and first in Britain for forming CEOs according to the *Professional Ranking World Universities*,[192] and first in the UK for the quality of its graduates as chosen by the recruiters of the UK's major companies.[193]\n\n\nIn the 2018 Complete University Guide, all 38 subjects offered by Oxford rank within the top 10 nationally meaning Oxford was one of only two multi-faculty universities (along with Cambridge) in the UK to have 100% of their subjects in the top 10.[194] Computer Science, Medicine, Philosophy, Politics and Psychology were ranked first in the UK by the guide.[195]\n\n\nAccording to the QS World University Rankings by Subject, the University of Oxford also ranks as number one in the world for four Humanities disciplines: English Language and Literature, Modern Languages, Geography, and History. It also ranks second globally for Anthropology, Archaeology, Law, Medicine, Politics & International Studies, and Psychology.[196]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)An undergraduate student at the University of Oxford in subfusc for matriculation\nAcademic dress is required for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held among the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations – 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum.[197] This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote not so much on making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, on abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow.[198] In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.[199]\n\n\n'Trashing' is a tradition of spraying those who just finished their last examination of the year with alcohol, flour and confetti. The sprayed student stays in the academic dress worn to the exam. The custom began in the 1970s when friends of students taking their finals waited outside Oxford's Examination Schools where exams for most degrees are taken.[200]\n\n\nOther traditions and customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally, or even not at all. \n\n\n*Balls* are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in ninth week of Trinity Term, are called commemoration balls; the dress code is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. \n\n\n\n### Clubs and societies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Oxford Union's debating chamber\n![](image)Rowing at Eights Week, an annual intercollegiate bumps race\nThe Oxford Union (not to be confused with the Oxford University Student Union) is an independent debating society which hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers.\n\n\nThere are two weekly student newspapers: the independent *Cherwell* and OUSU's *The Oxford Student*. Other publications include the *Isis* magazine, the satirical *Oxymoron*, the graduate *Oxonian Review*, the *Oxford Political Review*,[201] and the online only newspaper *The Oxford Blue*. The student radio station is Oxide Radio.\n\n\nSport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as cuppers (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard university wide groups. Significant focus is given to annual varsity matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is The Boat Race, watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, Torpids, and Summer Eights. A blue is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports. \n\n\nParty political groups include Oxford University Conservative Association and Oxford University Labour Club.\n\n\nMusic, drama, and other arts societies exist both at the collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Oxford Revue. Most colleges have chapel choirs. The Oxford Imps, a comedy improvisation troupe, perform weekly at The Jericho Tavern during term time.[202] The Imps first performed at the Wheatsheaf pub in Oxford High Street in January 2004,[203] and have performed at the Edinburgh Fringe[204] and overseas.\n\n\nMost academic areas have student societies of some form, for example the Scientific Society. \n\n\nPrivate members' clubs for students include Vincent's Club (primarily for sportspeople)[205] and The Gridiron Club.[206] A number of invitation-only student dining clubs also exist, including the Bullingdon Club.\n\n\n\n### Student union and common rooms[edit]\n\n\nThe Oxford University Student Union, formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU,[207] exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. \n\n\nThe importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) \n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of University of Oxford people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Oxford\n\nThroughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. A total of 70 Nobel prize-winners have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.[17]\nMore information on notable members of the university can be found in the individual college articles. An individual may be associated with two or more colleges, as an undergraduate, postgraduate and/or member of staff.\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nBritish Prime Ministers who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nClement Attlee, University College\n![](image)\nMargaret Thatcher, Somerville College\n![](image)\nRishi Sunak, Lincoln College\n\nThirty British prime ministers have attended Oxford, including William Gladstone, H. H. Asquith, Clement Attlee, Harold Macmillan, Edward Heath, Harold Wilson, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. Of all the post-war prime ministers, only Gordon Brown was educated at a university other than Oxford (the University of Edinburgh), while Winston Churchill, James Callaghan and John Major never attended a university.[208]\n\n\nOver 100 Oxford alumni were elected to the House of Commons in 2010.[208] This includes former Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband, and numerous members of the cabinet and shadow cabinet. Additionally, over 140 Oxonians sit in the House of Lords.[17]\n\n\n\nInternational leaders who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nAung San Suu Kyi, St Hugh's College\n![](image)\nIndira Gandhi, Somerville College\n![](image)\nBill Clinton, University College\n\nAt least 30 other international leaders have been educated at Oxford.[17] This number includes Harald V of Norway,[209] Abdullah II of Jordan,[17] William II of the Netherlands, five Prime Ministers of Australia (John Gorton, Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke, Tony Abbott, and Malcolm Turnbull),[210][211][212] six Prime Ministers of Pakistan (Liaquat Ali Khan, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Sir Feroz Khan Noon, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto and Imran Khan),[17] two Prime Ministers of Canada (Lester B. Pearson and John Turner),[17][213] two Prime Ministers of India (Manmohan Singh and Indira Gandhi, though the latter did not finish her degree),[17][214] S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike (Prime Minister of Ceylon), Eric Williams (Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago), Abhisit Vejjajiva (Prime Minister of Thailand),Norman Manley (Premier of Jamaica),[215] Haitham bin Tariq Al Said (Sultan of Oman),[216] and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (President of Peru). Bill Clinton is the first President of the United States to have attended Oxford; he attended as a Rhodes Scholar.[17][217] Arthur Mutambara (Deputy Prime Minister of Zimbabwe), was a Rhodes Scholar in 1991. Seretse Khama, first president of Botswana, spent a year at Balliol College. Festus Mogae (former president of Botswana) was a student at University College. The Burmese democracy activist and Nobel laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, was a student of St Hugh's College.[218] Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the current reigning Druk Gyalpo (Dragon King) of Bhutan, was a member of Magdalen College.[219] The world's youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, completed a BA in philosophy, politics and economics.[220]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nLawyers who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nDavid Neuberger, Christ Church\n![](image)\nRonald Dworkin, Magdalen College\n![](image)\nElena Kagan, Worcester College\nOxford has produced a large number of distinguished jurists, judges and lawyers around the world. Lords Bingham and Denning, commonly recognised as two of the most influential English judges in the history of the common law,[221][222][223][224] both studied at Oxford.

Note, however, that any university which does not want funding from HEFCE can, as a private corporation, charge whatever tuition fees it likes (exactly as does, say, the University of Buckingham or BPP University College). Under existing legislation and outside of the influence of the HEFCE-funding mechanism upon universities, Government can no more control university tuition fees than it can dictate the price of socks in Marks & Spencer. Universities are not part of the State and they are not part of the public sector; Government has no reserve powers of intervention even in a failing institution.\n87. **^** \"Conference of Colleges\".

There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2] making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.[2][11][12] It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge.[13] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*.\n\n\nThe University of Oxford is made up of thirty-nine semi-autonomous constituent colleges, four permanent private halls, and a range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions.[14] All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college.[15] It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided in a predominantly centralised fashion.\n\n\nOxford operates the Ashmolean Museum, the world's oldest university museum; Oxford University Press, the largest university press in the world; and the largest academic library system nationwide.[16] In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2022, the university had a total consolidated income of £2.78 billion, of which £711.4 million was from research grants and contracts.[4]\n\n\nOxford has educated a wide range of notable alumni, including 30 prime ministers of the United Kingdom and many heads of state and government around the world.[17] As of October 2022,[update] 73 Nobel Prize laureates, 4 Fields Medalists, and 6 Turing Award winners have matriculated, worked, or held visiting fellowships at the University of Oxford, while its alumni have won 160 Olympic medals.[18] Oxford is the home of numerous scholarships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, one of the oldest international graduate scholarship programmes.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Oxford\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Merton College's Mob Quad, the oldest quadrangle of the university, constructed between 1288 and 1378\n![](image)In 1605, Oxford was still a walled city, but several colleges had been built outside the city walls (north is at the bottom on this map).\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Balliol College, one of the university's oldest constituent colleges\nThe University of Oxford's foundation date is unknown.[19] It is known that teaching at Oxford existed in some form as early as 1096, but it is unclear when the university came into being.[2] The scholar Theobald of Étampes lectured at Oxford in the early 1100s.\n\n\nIt grew quickly from 1167 when English students returned from the University of Paris.[2] The historian Gerald of Wales lectured to such scholars in 1188, and the first known foreign scholar, Emo of Friesland, arrived in 1190. The head of the university had the title of chancellor from at least 1201, and the masters were recognised as a *universitas* or corporation in 1231.[2][20] The university was granted a royal charter in 1248 during the reign of King Henry III.[21]\n\n\nAfter disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled from the violence to Cambridge, later forming the University of Cambridge.[13][22]\n\n\nThe students associated together on the basis of geographical origins, into two 'nations', representing the North (*northerners* or *Boreales*, who included the English people from north of the River Trent and the Scots) and the South (*southerners* or *Australes*, who included English people from south of the Trent, the Irish and the Welsh).[23][24] In later centuries, geographical origins continued to influence many students' affiliations when membership of a college or hall became customary in Oxford. In addition, members of many religious orders, including Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites and Augustinians, settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century, gained influence and maintained houses or halls for students.[25] At about the same time, private benefactors established colleges as self-contained scholarly communities. Among the earliest such founders were William of Durham, who in 1249 endowed University College,[25] and John Balliol, father of a future King of Scots; Balliol College bears his name.[23] Another founder, Walter de Merton, a Lord Chancellor of England and afterwards Bishop of Rochester, devised a series of regulations for college life;[26][27] Merton College thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford,[28] as well as at the University of Cambridge. Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.[25]\n\n\nIn 1333–1334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III.[29] Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### Renaissance period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An engraving of Christ Church, Oxford, 1742\nThe new learning of the Renaissance greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were William Grocyn, who contributed to the revival of Greek language studies,[32] and John Colet, the noted biblical scholar.[33]\n\n\nWith the English Reformation and the breaking of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai.[34] The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.[35]\n\n\nIn 1636,[36] William Laud, the chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury, codified the university's statutes. These, to a large extent, remained its governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the University Press, and he made significant contributions to the Bodleian Library, the main library of the university. From the beginnings of the Church of England as the established church until 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to receive the BA degree from the university and \"dissenters\" were only permitted to receive the MA in 1871.[37]\n\n\nThe university was a centre of the Royalist party during the English Civil War (1642–1649), while the town favoured the opposing Parliamentarian cause.[38]\n\n\n\n![Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College](image)Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College\nWadham College, founded in 1610, was the undergraduate college of Sir Christopher Wren.\n\n\nWren was part of a brilliant group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s, the Oxford Philosophical Club, which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. This group, which has at times been linked with Boyle's \"Invisible College\" held regular meetings at Wadham under the guidance of the college's Warden, John Wilkins, and the group formed the nucleus that went on to found the Royal Society.[39]\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\n#### Students[edit]\n\n\nBefore reforms in the early 19th century, the curriculum at Oxford was notoriously narrow and impractical. Sir Spencer Walpole, a historian of contemporary Britain and a senior government official, had not attended any university. He said, \"Few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.\" He quoted the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: \"The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.\"[40] Nevertheless, Walpole argued:\n\n\n\n\n>  Among the many deficiencies attending a university education there was, however, one good thing about it, and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.[41]\n> \n> \n\n\nOut of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (59% as Anglican clergy). Out of the students who matriculated in 1870, 59% were sons of professionals (25% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (42% as Anglican clergy).[42][43]\n\n\nM. C. Curthoys and H. S. Jones argue that the rise of organised sport was one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton, Winchester, Shrewsbury, and Harrow.[44]\n\n\nAll students, regardless of their chosen area of study, were required to spend (at least) their first year preparing for a first-year examination that was heavily focused on classical languages. Science students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with Greek language study removed from their required courses. This concept of a Bachelor of Science had been adopted at other European universities (London University had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the \"natural science preliminary\" was recognized as a qualifying part of the first year examination.[45]\n\n\nAt the start of 1914, the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students. During the First World War, many undergraduates and fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 virtually all fellows were in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent of the pre-war total.[46] The University Roll of Service records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed.[47] Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War were on the Allied side; there is a remarkable memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces, bearing the inscription, 'In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914–1918'. During the war years the university buildings became hospitals, cadet schools and military training camps.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Reforms[edit]\n\n\nTwo parliamentary commissions in 1852 issued recommendations for Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.[48][49]\n\n\nThe system of separate honour schools for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and Literae Humaniores.[50] Schools of \"Natural Sciences\" and \"Law, and Modern History\" were added in 1853.[50] By 1872, the last of these had split into \"Jurisprudence\" and \"Modern History\". Theology became the sixth honour school.[51] In addition to these B.A. Honours degrees, the postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) was, and still is, offered.[52]\n\n\nThe mid-19th century saw the impact of the Oxford Movement (1833–1845), led among others by the future Cardinal John Henry Newman. \n\n\nAdministrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for religious dissent, and the establishment of four women's colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies.\n\n\nThe University of Oxford began to award doctorates for research in the first third of the 20th century. The first Oxford DPhil in mathematics was awarded in 1921.[53]\n\n\nThe list of distinguished scholars at the University of Oxford is long and includes many who have made major contributions to politics, the sciences, medicine, and literature. As of October 2022, 73 Nobel laureates and more than 50 world leaders have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.[17]\n\n\n\n### Women's education[edit]\n\n\nFirst two women's colleges\n![](image)\nLady Margaret Hall, founded in 1878\n![](image)\nSomerville College, founded in 1879\n\nThe university passed a statute in 1875 allowing examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level;[54] for a brief period in the early 1900s, this allowed the \"steamboat ladies\" to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[55] In June 1878, the *Association for the Education of Women* (AEW) was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, T. H. Green and Edward Stuart Talbot. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group founded Lady Margaret Hall in 1878, while T. H. Green founded the non-denominational Somerville College in 1879.[56] Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville opened their doors to their first 21 students (12 from Somerville, 9 from Lady Margaret Hall) in 1879, who attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop.[54] There were also 25 women students living at home or with friends in 1879, a group which evolved into the Society of Oxford Home-Students and in 1952 into St Anne's College.[57][58]\n\n\nThese first three societies for women were followed by St Hugh's (1886)[59] and St Hilda's (1893).[60] All of these colleges later became coeducational, starting with Lady Margaret Hall and St Anne's in 1979,[61][62] and finishing with St Hilda's, which began to accept male students in 2008.[63] In the early 20th century, Oxford and Cambridge were widely perceived to be bastions of male privilege,[64] however the integration of women into Oxford moved forward during the First World War. In 1916 women were admitted as medical students on a par with men, and in 1917 the university accepted financial responsibility for women's examinations.[46]\n\n\nOn 7 October 1920 women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees.[65] In 1927 the university's dons created a quota that limited the number of female students to a quarter that of men, a ruling which was not abolished until 1957.[54] However, during this period Oxford colleges were single sex, so the number of women was also limited by the capacity of the women's colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women's colleges were given full collegiate status.[66]\n\n\nIn 1974, Brasenose, Jesus, Wadham, Hertford and St Catherine's became the first previously all-male colleges to admit women.[67][68] The majority of men's colleges accepted their first female students in 1979,[68] with Christ Church following in 1980,[69] and Oriel becoming the last men's college to admit women in 1985.[70] Most of Oxford's graduate colleges were founded as coeducational establishments in the 20th century, with the exception of St Antony's, which was founded as a men's college in 1950 and began to accept women only in 1962.[71] By 1988, 40% of undergraduates at Oxford were female;[72] in 2016, 45% of the student population, and 47% of undergraduate students, were female.[73][74]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Oxford announced that starting the following academic year, history students may choose to sit a take-home exam in some courses, with the intention that this will equalise rates of firsts awarded to women and men at Oxford.[75] That same summer, maths and computer science tests were extended by 15 minutes, in a bid to see if female student scores would improve.[76][77]\n\n\nThe detective novel *Gaudy Night* by Dorothy L. Sayers, herself one of the first women to gain an academic degree from Oxford, is largely set in the all-female Shrewsbury College, Oxford (based on Sayers' own Somerville College[78]), and the issue of women's education is central to its plot. Social historian and Somerville College alumna Jane Robinson's book *Bluestockings: A Remarkable History of the First Women to Fight for an Education* gives a very detailed and immersive account of this history.[79]\n\n\n\n## Buildings and sites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*Scrollable image*.

heavily in new facilities at the laboratory in recent years.\n![](image)Sheldonian Theatre, built by Christopher Wren between 1664 and 1668, hosts the university's Congregation and its concerts and degree ceremonies.\nThe university is a \"city university\" in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. The Science Area, in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) Radcliffe Observatory Quarter in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges' sites are of similar size to these areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIconic university buildings include the Radcliffe Camera, the Sheldonian Theatre used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the Examination Schools, where examinations and some lectures take place. The University Church of St Mary the Virgin was used for university ceremonies before the construction of the Sheldonian. Christ Church Cathedral uniquely serves as both a college chapel and as a cathedral.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2012–2013, the university built the controversial one-hectare (400 m × 25 m) Castle Mill development of 4–5-storey blocks of student flats overlooking Cripley Meadow and the historic Port Meadow, blocking views of the spires in the city centre.[80] The development has been likened to building a \"skyscraper beside Stonehenge\".[81]\n\n\n\n### Parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Summer in the Botanic Garden\nThe University Parks are a 70-acre (28 ha) parkland area in the northeast of the city, near Keble College, Somerville College and Lady Margaret Hall. It is open to the public during daylight hours. \n\n\nThe Botanic Garden on the High Street is the oldest botanic garden in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on 1.8 ha (4+1⁄2 acres). It is one of the most diverse yet compact major collections of plants in the world and includes representatives of over 90% of the higher plant families. The Harcourt Arboretum is a 130-acre (53 ha) site six miles (9.7 km) south of the city that includes native woodland and 67 acres (27 hectares) of meadow. The 1,000-acre (4.0 km2) Wytham Woods are owned by the university and used for research in zoology and climate change.[82]\n\n\nThere are also various college-owned open spaces open to the public, including Bagley Wood and most notably Christ Church Meadow.[83]\n\n\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Departments of the University of Oxford\nColleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Central governance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wellington Square has become synonymous with the university's central administration.\nThe university's formal head is the Chancellor, currently Lord Patten of Barnes, though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figurehead and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of Convocation, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.[84]\n\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor, currently Irene Tracey,[6] is the *de facto* head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. \n\n\nTwo university proctors, elected annually on a rotating basis from any two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student discipline and complaints, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings.[85] The university's professors are collectively referred to as the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the Chichele Professorships and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy. \n\n\nThe University of Oxford is only a \"public university\" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.[86]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Tom Quad, Christ Church\n![](image)Main Quad, Worcester College\nTo be a member of the university, all students, and most academic staff, must also be a member of a college or hall. There are thirty-nine colleges of the University of Oxford and four permanent private halls (PPHs), each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities.[15] Not all colleges offer all courses, but they generally cover a broad range of subjects.\n\n\nThe colleges are:\n\n\n\n* All Souls College\n* Balliol College\n* Brasenose College\n* Christ Church\n* Corpus Christi College\n* Exeter College\n* Green Templeton College\n* Harris Manchester College\n* Hertford College\n* Jesus College\n* Keble College\n* Kellogg College\n* Lady Margaret Hall\n* Linacre College\n* Lincoln College\n* Magdalen College\n* Mansfield College\n* Merton College\n* New College\n* Nuffield College\n* Oriel College\n* Pembroke College\n* The Queen's College\n* Reuben College\n* St Anne's College\n* St Antony's College\n* St Catherine's College\n* St Cross College\n* St Edmund Hall\n* St Hilda's College\n* St Hugh's College\n* St John's College\n* St Peter's College\n* Somerville College\n* Trinity College\n* University College\n* Wadham College\n* Wolfson College\n* Worcester College\n\nThe permanent private halls were founded by different Christian denominations. One difference between a college and a PPH is that whereas colleges are governed by the fellows of the college, the governance of a PPH resides, at least in part, with the corresponding Christian denomination. The four current PPHs are:\n\n\n\n* Blackfriars Hall\n* Campion Hall\n* Regent's Park College\n* Wycliffe Hall\n\n\nThe PPHs and colleges join as the Conference of Colleges, which represents the common concerns of the several colleges of the university, to discuss matters of shared interest and to act collectively when necessary, such as in dealings with the central university.[87][88] The Conference of Colleges was established as a recommendation of the Franks Commission in 1965.[89]\n\n\nTeaching members of the colleges (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons, although the term is rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments. \n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dining hall at Christ Church; the hall is an important feature of the typical Oxford college, providing a place to dine and socialise.\nIn 2017–18, the university had an income of £2,237m; key sources were research grants (£579.1m) and academic fees (£332.5m).[90] The colleges had a total income of £492.9m.[91]\n\n\nWhile the university has a larger annual income and operating budget, the colleges have a larger aggregate endowment: over £6.4bn compared to the university's £1.2bn.[4] The central University's endowment, along with some of the colleges', is managed by the university's wholly-owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007.[92] The university used to maintain substantial investments in fossil fuel companies.[93] However, in April 2020, the university committed to divest from direct investments in fossil fuel companies and to require indirect investments in fossil fuel companies be subjected to the Oxford Martin Principles.[94][95]\n\n\nThe total assets of the colleges of £6.3 billion also exceed total university assets of £4.1 billion.[91][90] The college figure does not reflect all the assets held by the colleges as their accounts do not include the cost or value of many of their main sites or heritage assets such as works of art or libraries.[96]\n\n\nThe university was one of the first in the UK to raise money through a major public fundraising campaign, the Campaign for Oxford. The current campaign, its second, was launched in May 2008 and is entitled \"Oxford Thinking – The Campaign for the University of Oxford\".[97] This is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure;[98] having passed its original target of £1.25 billion in March 2012, the target was raised to £3 billion.[99] The campaign had raised a total of £2.8 billion by July 2018.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Funding criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe university has faced criticism for some of its sources of donations and funding. In 2017, attention was drawn to historical donations including All Souls College receiving £10,000 from slave trader Christopher Codrington in 1710,[100] and Oriel College having receiving taken £100,000 from the will of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes in 1902.[101][102] In 1996 a donation of £20 million was received from Wafic Saïd who was involved in the Al-Yammah arms deal,[103][104] and taking £150 million from the US billionaire businessman Stephen A. Schwarzman in 2019.[105] The university has defended its decisions saying it \"takes legal, ethical and reputational issues into consideration\".\n\n\nThe university has also faced criticism, as noted above, over its decision to accept donations from fossil fuel companies having received £21.8 million from the fossil fuel industry between 2010 and 2015[106] and £18.8 million between 2015 and 2020.[107][108]\n\n\nThe university accepted £6 million from The Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust in 2021. Former racing driver Max Mosley said he set up the trust \"to house the fortune he inherited\" from his father,[109] Oswald Mosley, who was founder of two far right groups: Union Movement and the British Union of Fascists.[110]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nOxford is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, and the International Alliance of Research Universities. It is also a core member of the Europaeum and forms part of the \"golden triangle\" of highly research intensive and elite English universities.[111]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Admission[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics\n|  | 2022[112] | 2021[113] | 2020[114] | 2019[115] | 2018[116] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 23,819\n | 24,338\n | 23,414\n | 23,020\n | 21,515\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 15.3\n | 14.6\n | 16.8\n | 16.9\n | 17.8\n |\n| **Enrols** | 3,271\n | 3,298\n | 3,695\n | 3,280\n | 3,309\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 89.7\n | 92.8\n | 94.0\n | 84.3\n | 86.2\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 7.28\n | 7.38\n | 6.34\n | 7.02\n | 6.50\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[117] | —\n | 205\n | 201\n | 200\n | 205\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition (2022)\n| Domicile[118] and Ethnicity[119] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 50%\n | 50 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[a] | 16%\n | 16 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 25%\n | 25 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[120][121] |\n| Female | 54%\n | 54 |\n| Private Schools | 31%\n | 31 |\n| Low Participation Areas[b] | 6%\n | 6 |\n\n\n![](image)Percentage of state-school students at Oxford and Cambridge[122][123]\nIn common with most British universities, prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.[124] The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit undergraduates disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[125]\n\n\nTo allow a more personalised judgement of students, who might otherwise apply for both, undergraduate applicants are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year. The only exceptions are applicants for organ scholarships[126] and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree.[127]\nOxford has the lowest offer rate of all Russell Group universities.[128]\n\n\nMost applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges. For undergraduates, these colleges work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the university regardless of their college preferences. For postgraduates, all applicants who receive an offer from the university are guaranteed a college place, even if they do not receive a place at their chosen college.[129]\n\n\nUndergraduate shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most undergraduate applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. \n\n\nUndergraduate offers are sent out in early January, with each offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receives an offer from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make \"open offers\" to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until A Level results day in August.[130][131]\n\n\nThe university has come under criticism for the number of students it accepts from private schools;[132] for instance, Laura Spence's rejection from the university in 2000 led to widespread debate.[133] In 2016, the University of Oxford gave 59% of offers to UK students to students from state schools, while about 93% of all UK pupils and 86% of post-16 UK pupils are educated in state schools.[134][135][136] However, 64% of UK applicants were from state schools and the university notes that state school students apply disproportionately to oversubscribed subjects.[137] The proportion of students coming from state schools has been increasing. From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%.[138] Oxford University spends over £6 million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.[134]\n\n\nIn 2018 the university's annual admissions report revealed that eight of Oxford's colleges had accepted fewer than three black applicants in the past three years.[139] Labour MP David Lammy said, \"This is social apartheid and it is utterly unrepresentative of life in modern Britain.\"[140] In 2020, Oxford had increased its proportion of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students to record levels.[141][142] The number of BAME undergraduates accepted to the university in 2020 rose to 684 students, or 23.6% of the UK intake, up from 558 or 22% in 2019; the number of Black students was 106 (3.7% of the intake), up from 80 students (3.2%).[142][143] UCAS data also showed that Oxford is more likely than comparable institutions to make offers to ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged pupils.[141]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and degrees[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Degrees of the University of Oxford, List of professorships at the University of Oxford, and Undergraduate education at University of Oxford\n\nUndergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1–4 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week's work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight-week academic terms: Michaelmas, Hilary and Trinity.[144] (These are officially known as 'Full Term': 'Term' is a lengthier period with little practical significance.) Internally, the weeks in a term begin on Sundays, and are referred to numerically, with the initial week known as \"first week\", the last as \"eighth week\" and with the numbering extended to refer to weeks before and after term (for example \"noughth week\" precedes term).[145] Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week. These teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities,[146] and their total duration amounts to less than half the year. However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).\n\n\nResearch degrees at the master's and doctoral level are conferred in all subjects studied at graduate level at the university.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Scholarships and financial support[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhodes House, home to the awarding body for Rhodes Scholarships, is often considered as the world's most prestigious scholarship.\nThere are many opportunities for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate, with a total possible grant of £10,235 over a 3-year degree. In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships.[147] Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities.[148] The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by Oxford University Press in association with colleges and other partnership awards.[149][150] In 2016, Oxford University announced that it is to run its first free online economics course as part of a \"massive open online course\" (Mooc) scheme, in partnership with a US online university network.[151] The course available is called 'From Poverty to Prosperity: Understanding Economic Development'.\n\n\nStudents successful in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with scholarships and exhibitions, normally the result of a long-standing endowment, although since the introduction of tuition fees the amounts of money available are purely nominal. Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; \"commoners\" (originally those who had to pay for their \"commons\", or food and lodging) are restricted to a short, sleeveless garment. The term \"scholar\" in relation to Oxford therefore has a specific meaning as well as the more general meaning of someone of outstanding academic ability. In previous times, there were \"noblemen commoners\" and \"gentlemen commoners\", but these ranks were abolished in the 19th century. \"Closed\" scholarships, available only to candidates who fitted specific conditions such as coming from specific schools, were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s.[152]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Libraries of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Clarendon Building, home to many senior Bodleian Library staff, previously housed the university's own central administration.\nThe university maintains the largest university library system in the UK,[16] and, with over 11 million volumes housed on 120 miles (190 km) of shelving, the Bodleian group is the second-largest library in the UK, after the British Library. The Bodleian is a legal deposit library, which means that it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK. As such, its collection is growing at a rate of over three miles (five kilometres) of shelving every year.[153]\n\n\nThe buildings referred to as the university's main research library, The Bodleian, consist of the original Bodleian Library in the Old Schools Quadrangle, founded by Sir Thomas Bodley in 1598 and opened in 1602,[154] the Radcliffe Camera, the Clarendon Building, and the Weston Library. A tunnel underneath Broad Street connects these buildings, with the Gladstone Link, which opened to readers in 2011, connecting the Old Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera.\n\n\nThe Bodleian Libraries group was formed in 2000, bringing the Bodleian Library and some of the subject libraries together.[155] It now comprises 28[156] libraries, a number of which have been created by bringing previously separate collections together, including the Sackler Library, Law Library, Social Science Library and Radcliffe Science Library.[155] Another major product of this collaboration has been a joint integrated library system, OLIS (**O**xford **L**ibraries **I**nformation **S**ystem),[157] and its public interface, **SOLO** (**S**earch **O**xford **L**ibraries **O**nline), which provides an electronic catalogue covering all member libraries, as well as the libraries of individual colleges and other faculty libraries, which are not members of the group but do share cataloguing information.[158]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duke Humfrey's Library in the Bodleian Library\nA new book depository opened in South Marston, Swindon, in October 2010,[159] and recent building projects include the remodelling of the New Bodleian building, which was renamed the Weston Library when it reopened in 2015.[160][161] The renovation is designed to better showcase the library's various treasures (which include a Shakespeare First Folio and a Gutenberg Bible) as well as temporary exhibitions.\n\n\nThe Bodleian engaged in a mass-digitisation project with Google in 2004.[162][163] Notable electronic resources hosted by the Bodleian Group include the *Electronic Enlightenment Project*, which was awarded the 2010 Digital Prize by the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies.[164]\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Museums of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Interior of the Pitt Rivers Museum\nOxford maintains a number of museums and galleries, open for free to the public. The Ashmolean Museum, founded in 1683, is the oldest museum in the UK, and the oldest university museum in the world.[165] It holds significant collections of art and archaeology, including works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Turner, and Picasso, as well as treasures such as the Scorpion Macehead, the Parian Marble and the Alfred Jewel. It also contains \"The Messiah\", a pristine Stradivarius violin, regarded by some as one of the finest examples in existence.[166]\n\n\nThe University Museum of Natural History holds the university's zoological, entomological and geological specimens. It is housed in a large neo-Gothic building on Parks Road, in the university's Science Area.[167][168] Among its collection are the skeletons of a *Tyrannosaurus rex* and *Triceratops*, and the most complete remains of a dodo found anywhere in the world. It also hosts the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science, currently held by Marcus du Sautoy.[169]\n\n\nAdjoining the Museum of Natural History is the Pitt Rivers Museum, founded in 1884, which displays the university's archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items. It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General Augustus Pitt Rivers stipulated that the university establish a lectureship in anthropology.[170]\n\n\nThe Museum of the History of Science is housed on Broad Street in the world's oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building.[171] It contains 15,000 artefacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science. In the Faculty of Music on St Aldate's is the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. Christ Church Picture Gallery holds a large collection of old master paintings and drawings.[172]\n\n\n\n### Publishing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Oxford University Press\n\nThe Oxford University Press is the world's second oldest and currently the largest university press by the number of publications.[173] More than 6,000 new books are published annually,[174] including many reference, professional, and academic works (such as the *Oxford English Dictionary*, the *Concise Oxford English Dictionary*, the *Oxford World's Classics*, the *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography*, and the *Concise Dictionary of National Biography*).\n\n\n\n### Rankings and reputation[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[175] | 2 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[176] | 2 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[177] | 2 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[178] | 7 |\n| *QS* (2025)[179] | 3 |\n| *THE* (2024)[180] | 1 |\n\n\n![](image)University of Oxford's national league table performance over the past ten years\nOxford is regularly ranked within the top five universities in the world and is currently ranked first in the world in the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*,[181][182] as well as the Forbes's World University Rankings.[183] It held the number one position in the *Times Good University Guide* for eleven consecutive years,[184] and the medical school has also maintained first place in the \"Clinical, Pre-Clinical & Health\" table of the *Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings* for the past seven consecutive years.[185] In 2021, it ranked sixth among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[186] The *THE* has also recognised Oxford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Stanford.[187] The university is fifth worldwide on the *US News* ranking.[188] Its Saïd Business School came 13th in the world in *Financial Times* *Global MBA Ranking*.[189]\n\n\nOxford was ranked 13th in the world in 2022 by the Nature Index, which measures the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[190][191] It is ranked fifth best university worldwide and first in Britain for forming CEOs according to the *Professional Ranking World Universities*,[192] and first in the UK for the quality of its graduates as chosen by the recruiters of the UK's major companies.[193]\n\n\nIn the 2018 Complete University Guide, all 38 subjects offered by Oxford rank within the top 10 nationally meaning Oxford was one of only two multi-faculty universities (along with Cambridge) in the UK to have 100% of their subjects in the top 10.[194] Computer Science, Medicine, Philosophy, Politics and Psychology were ranked first in the UK by the guide.[195]\n\n\nAccording to the QS World University Rankings by Subject, the University of Oxford also ranks as number one in the world for four Humanities disciplines: English Language and Literature, Modern Languages, Geography, and History. It also ranks second globally for Anthropology, Archaeology, Law, Medicine, Politics & International Studies, and Psychology.[196]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)An undergraduate student at the University of Oxford in subfusc for matriculation\nAcademic dress is required for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held among the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations – 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum.[197] This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote not so much on making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, on abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow.[198] In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.[199]\n\n\n'Trashing' is a tradition of spraying those who just finished their last examination of the year with alcohol, flour and confetti. The sprayed student stays in the academic dress worn to the exam. The custom began in the 1970s when friends of students taking their finals waited outside Oxford's Examination Schools where exams for most degrees are taken.[200]\n\n\nOther traditions and customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally, or even not at all. \n\n\n*Balls* are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in ninth week of Trinity Term, are called commemoration balls; the dress code is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. \n\n\n\n### Clubs and societies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Oxford Union's debating chamber\n![](image)Rowing at Eights Week, an annual intercollegiate bumps race\nThe Oxford Union (not to be confused with the Oxford University Student Union) is an independent debating society which hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers.\n\n\nThere are two weekly student newspapers: the independent *Cherwell* and OUSU's *The Oxford Student*. Other publications include the *Isis* magazine, the satirical *Oxymoron*, the graduate *Oxonian Review*, the *Oxford Political Review*,[201] and the online only newspaper *The Oxford Blue*. The student radio station is Oxide Radio.\n\n\nSport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as cuppers (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard university wide groups. Significant focus is given to annual varsity matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is The Boat Race, watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, Torpids, and Summer Eights. A blue is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports. \n\n\nParty political groups include Oxford University Conservative Association and Oxford University Labour Club.\n\n\nMusic, drama, and other arts societies exist both at the collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Oxford Revue. Most colleges have chapel choirs. The Oxford Imps, a comedy improvisation troupe, perform weekly at The Jericho Tavern during term time.[202] The Imps first performed at the Wheatsheaf pub in Oxford High Street in January 2004,[203] and have performed at the Edinburgh Fringe[204] and overseas.\n\n\nMost academic areas have student societies of some form, for example the Scientific Society. \n\n\nPrivate members' clubs for students include Vincent's Club (primarily for sportspeople)[205] and The Gridiron Club.[206] A number of invitation-only student dining clubs also exist, including the Bullingdon Club.\n\n\n\n### Student union and common rooms[edit]\n\n\nThe Oxford University Student Union, formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU,[207] exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. \n\n\nThe importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) \n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of University of Oxford people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Oxford\n\nThroughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. A total of 70 Nobel prize-winners have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.[17]\nMore information on notable members of the university can be found in the individual college articles. An individual may be associated with two or more colleges, as an undergraduate, postgraduate and/or member of staff.\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nBritish Prime Ministers who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nClement Attlee, University College\n![](image)\nMargaret Thatcher, Somerville College\n![](image)\nRishi Sunak, Lincoln College\n\nThirty British prime ministers have attended Oxford, including William Gladstone, H. H. Asquith, Clement Attlee, Harold Macmillan, Edward Heath, Harold Wilson, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. Of all the post-war prime ministers, only Gordon Brown was educated at a university other than Oxford (the University of Edinburgh), while Winston Churchill, James Callaghan and John Major never attended a university.[208]\n\n\nOver 100 Oxford alumni were elected to the House of Commons in 2010.[208] This includes former Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband, and numerous members of the cabinet and shadow cabinet. Additionally, over 140 Oxonians sit in the House of Lords.[17]\n\n\n\nInternational leaders who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nAung San Suu Kyi, St Hugh's College\n![](image)\nIndira Gandhi, Somerville College\n![](image)\nBill Clinton, University College\n\nAt least 30 other international leaders have been educated at Oxford.[17] This number includes Harald V of Norway,[209] Abdullah II of Jordan,[17] William II of the Netherlands, five Prime Ministers of Australia (John Gorton, Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke, Tony Abbott, and Malcolm Turnbull),[210][211][212] six Prime Ministers of Pakistan (Liaquat Ali Khan, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Sir Feroz Khan Noon, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto and Imran Khan),[17] two Prime Ministers of Canada (Lester B.

Seretse Khama, first president of Botswana, spent a year at Balliol College. Festus Mogae (former president of Botswana) was a student at University College. The Burmese democracy activist and Nobel laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, was a student of St Hugh's College.[218] Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the current reigning Druk Gyalpo (Dragon King) of Bhutan, was a member of Magdalen College.[219] The world's youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, completed a BA in philosophy, politics and economics.[220]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nLawyers who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nDavid Neuberger, Christ Church\n![](image)\nRonald Dworkin, Magdalen College\n![](image)\nElena Kagan, Worcester College\nOxford has produced a large number of distinguished jurists, judges and lawyers around the world. Lords Bingham and Denning, commonly recognised as two of the most influential English judges in the history of the common law,[221][222][223][224] both studied at Oxford.

Religious reformer John Wycliffe was an Oxford scholar, for a time Master of Balliol College. John Colet, Christian humanist, Dean of St Paul's, and friend of Erasmus, studied at Magdalen College. Several of the Caroline Divines e.g. in particular William Laud as President of St. John's and Chancellor of the university, and the Non-Jurors, e.g. Thomas Ken had close Oxford connections. The founder of Methodism, John Wesley, studied at Christ Church and was elected a fellow of Lincoln College.[281] Britain's first woman to be an ordained minister, Constance Coltman, studied at Somerville College. The Oxford Movement (1833–1846) was closely associated with the Oriel fellows John Henry Newman, Edward Bouverie Pusey and John Keble. Other religious figures were Mirza Nasir Ahmad, the third Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Shoghi Effendi, one of the appointed leaders of the Baháʼí Faith, and Joseph Cordeiro, the first Pakistani Catholic cardinal.[282]\n\n\n\n### Philosophy[edit]\n\n\nPhilosophers who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nJohn Locke, Christ Church\n![](image)\nMary Midgley, Somerville College\n![](image)\nThomas Hobbes, Hertford College\n\nOxford's philosophical tradition started in the medieval era, with Robert Grosseteste[283] and William of Ockham,[283] commonly known for Occam's razor, among those teaching at the university. Thomas Hobbes,[284][285] Jeremy Bentham and the empiricist John Locke received degrees from Oxford. Though the latter's main works were written after leaving Oxford, Locke was heavily influenced by his twelve years at the university.[283]\n\n\nOxford philosophers of the 20th century include Richard Swinburne, a leading philosopher in the tradition of substance dualism; Peter Hacker, philosopher of mind, language, anthropology, and he is also known for his critique of cognitive neuroscience; J.L.

Founded in 1636 as Harvard College and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard, it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[9]\n\n\nHarvard's founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature, \"dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches\"; though never formally affiliated with any denomination, in its early years, Harvard College primarily trained Congregational clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.\n\n\nThe university is composed of ten academic faculties plus the Harvard Radcliffe Institute. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate academic disciplines, and other faculties offer only graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard has three main campuses:[13]\nthe 209-acre (85 ha) Cambridge campus centered on Harvard Yard; an adjoining campus immediately across Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical campus in Boston's Longwood Medical Area.[14] Harvard's endowment is valued at $50.7 billion, making it the wealthiest academic institution in the world.[3][4] Endowment income enables the undergraduate college to admit students regardless of financial need and provide financial aid with no loans.[15] Harvard Library is the world's largest academic library system, comprising 79 individual libraries holding 20 million items.[16][17][18][19]\n\n\nThroughout its existence, Harvard alumni, faculty, and researchers have included 188 living billionaires, 8 U.S. presidents, numerous heads of state, Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, members of Congress, MacArthur Fellows, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Turing Award Recipients and Fulbright Scholars; by most metrics, Harvard ranks among the top globally in each of these categories.[Notes 1] Additionally, students and alumni have won 10 Academy Awards, 48 Pulitzer Prizes, 110 Olympic medals (46 gold), and have founded notable companies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Harvard University\n\n### Colonial era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: John Harvard (clergyman)\n\n![](image)The Harvard Corporation seal found on Harvard diplomas. *Christo et Ecclesiae* (Latin: \"For Christ and Church\") is one of Harvard's several early mottoes.[20]\n![](image)Engraving of Harvard College by Paul Revere, 1767\nHarvard was founded in 1636 during the colonial, pre-Revolutionary era by vote of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony. Its first headmaster, Nathaniel Eaton, took office the following year. In 1638, the university acquired British North America's first known printing press.[21][22]\n\n\nIn 1639, it was named Harvard College after John Harvard, an English clergyman who had died soon after immigrating to Massachusetts, bequeathing it £780 and his library of some 320 volumes.[23] The charter creating Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.\n\n\nA 1643 publication defined the college's purpose: \"to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust.\"[24] The college trained many Puritan ministers in its early years[25] and offered a classic curriculum based on the English university model—many leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge‍—‌conformed to the tenets of Puritanism. Harvard never affiliated with any particular denomination.[26]\n\n\nIncrease Mather served as Harvard College's president from 1681 to 1701. In 1708, John Leverett became the first president who was not also a clergyman.[27]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Harvard statue on Harvard Yard\nIn the 19th century, Enlightenment ideas of reason and free will were widespread among Congregational ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations at odds with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties.[28]: 1–4 When Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and President Joseph Willard died a year later, a struggle broke out over their replacements. Henry Ware was elected Hollis chair in 1805, and liberal Samuel Webber was appointed president two years later, signaling a shift from traditional ideas at Harvard to liberal, Arminian ideas.[28]: 4–5[29]: 24\n\n\nCharles William Eliot, Harvard president from 1869 to 1909, decreased the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. Though Eliot was an influential figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated more by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions influenced by William Ellery Channing, Ralph Waldo Emerson and others of the time, than by secularism.[30]\n\n\nIn 1816, Harvard launched new programs in the study of French and Spanish with George Ticknor as first professor for these language programs.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1906 watercolor painting of the campus, facing northeast[31]\nHarvard's graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers in the late 19th century. During World War II, students at Radcliffe College (which, since its 1879 founding, had been paying Harvard professors to repeat their lectures for women) began attending Harvard classes alongside men.[32] In 1945, women were first admitted to the medical school.[33]\nSince 1971, Harvard had controlled essentially all aspects of undergraduate admission, instruction, and housing for Radcliffe women; in 1999, Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard.[34]\n\n\nIn the 20th century, Harvard's reputation grew as its endowment burgeoned and prominent intellectuals and professors affiliated with the university. The university's rapid enrollment growth also was a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the undergraduate college. Radcliffe College emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities.[12]\n\n\nThe student body in its first decades of the 20th century was predominantly \"old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians\", according to sociologist and author Jerome Karabel.[35] In 1923, a year after the percentage of Jewish students at Harvard reached 20%, President A. Lawrence Lowell supported a policy change that would have capped the admission of Jewish students to 15% of the undergraduate population. But Lowell's idea was rejected. Lowell also refused to mandate forced desegregation in the university's freshman dormitories, writing that, \"We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man, but we do not owe to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial.\"[36][37][38][39]\n\n\nPresident James B. Conant led the university from 1933 to 1953; Conant reinvigorated creative scholarship in an effort to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among the nation and world's emerging research institutions. Conant viewed higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy. As such, he devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. An influential 268-page report issued by Harvard faculty in 1945 under Conant's leadership, *General Education in a Free Society*, remains one the most important works in curriculum studies.[40]\n\n\nBetween 1945 and 1960, admissions standardized to open the university to a more diverse group of students; for example, after World War II, special exams were developed so veterans could be considered for admission.[41] No longer drawing mostly from select New England prep schools, the undergraduate college became accessible to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but still few Blacks, Hispanics, or Asians versus the representation of these groups in the general population.[42] Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, Harvard incrementally became vastly more diverse.[43]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nDrew Gilpin Faust, who was dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute, became Harvard's first female president on July 1, 2007.[44] In 2018, Faust retired and joined the board of Goldman Sachs.\n\n\nOn July 1, 2018, Lawrence Bacow was appointed Harvard's 29th president.[45] Bacow intends to retire in 2023. \n\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Claudine Gay, a Harvard University political scientist and former dean of Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, succeeded Bacow as the university's 30th president.\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Hall\n### Cambridge[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Graduate School of Design, Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Radcliffe Institute\n\nHarvard's 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard (\"the Yard\") in Cambridge, about 3 miles (5 km) west-northwest of downtown Boston, and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood. The Yard contains administrative offices such as University Hall and Massachusetts Hall; libraries such as Widener, Pusey, Houghton, and Lamont; and Memorial Church.\n\n\n\nThe Yard and adjacent areas include the main academic buildings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including the college, such as Sever Hall and Harvard Hall.\n\n![](image)Memorial ChurchFreshman dormitories are in, or adjacent to, the Yard. Upperclassmen live in the twelve residential houses – nine south of the Yard near the Charles River, the others half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Radcliffe Quadrangle (which formerly housed Radcliffe College students). Each house is a community of undergraduates, faculty deans, and resident tutors, with its own dining hall, library, and recreational facilities.[46]\n\n\nAlso in Cambridge are the Law, Divinity (theology), Engineering and Applied Science, Design (architecture), Education, Kennedy (public policy), and Extension schools, as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Radcliffe Yard.[47]\nHarvard also has commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Allston[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard University's expansion in Allston, Massachusetts\n\nHarvard Business School, Harvard Innovation Labs, and many athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a 358-acre (145 ha) campus in Allston,[50]\na Boston neighborhood just across the Charles River from the Cambridge campus. The John W. Weeks Bridge, a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River, connects the two campuses.\n\n\nThe university is actively expanding into Allston, where it now owns more land than in Cambridge.[51]\nPlans include new construction and renovation for the Business School, a hotel and conference center, graduate student housing, Harvard Stadium, and other athletics facilities.[52]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will expanded into a new, 500,000+ square foot Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) in Allston.[53]\nThe SEC will be adjacent to the Enterprise Research Campus, the Business School, and the Harvard Innovation Labs to encourage technology- and life science-focused startups as well as collaborations with mature companies.[54]\n\n\n\n### Longwood[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Longwood Medical and Academic Area\n\n![](image)Harvard Medical School\nThe schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Public Health are located on a 21-acre (8.5 ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area in Boston, about 3.3 miles (5.3 km) south of the Cambridge campus.[14]\nSeveral Harvard-affiliated hospitals and research institutes are also in Longwood, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, Joslin Diabetes Center, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. Additional affiliates, most notably Massachusetts General Hospital, are located throughout the Greater Boston area.\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nHarvard owns the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, D.C., Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts, the Concord Field Station in Estabrook Woods in Concord, Massachusetts,[55]\nthe Villa I Tatti research center in Florence, Italy,[56]\nthe Harvard Shanghai Center in Shanghai, China,[57]\nand the Arnold Arboretum in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **School** | **Founded** |\n| Harvard College | 1636\n |\n| Medicine | 1782\n |\n| Divinity | 1816\n |\n| Law | 1817\n |\n| Engineering and Applied Sciences | 1847\n |\n| Dental Medicine | 1867\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | 1872\n |\n| Business | 1908\n |\n| Extension | 1910\n |\n| Design | 1936\n |\n| Education | 1920\n |\n| Public Health | 1913\n |\n| Government | 1936\n |\n\n\n![](image)University seal\nHarvard is governed by a combination of its Board of Overseers and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (also known as the Harvard Corporation), which in turn appoints the President of Harvard University.[58]\nThere are 16,000 staff and faculty,[59]\nincluding 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors.[60]\n\n\nThe Faculty of Arts and Sciences is the largest Harvard faculty and has primary responsibility for instruction in Harvard College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and the Division of Continuing Education, which includes Harvard Summer School and Harvard Extension School. There are nine other graduate and professional faculties as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.\n\n\nJoint programs with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, the Broad Institute, The Observatory of Economic Complexity, and edX.\n\n\n\n### Endowment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard University endowment\n\nHarvard has the largest university endowment in the world, valued at about $50.7 billion as of 2023.[3][4]\nDuring the recession of 2007–2009, it suffered significant losses that forced large budget cuts, in particular temporarily halting construction on the Allston Science Complex.[61]\nThe endowment has since recovered.[62][63][64][65]\n\n\nAbout $2 billion of investment income is annually distributed to fund operations.[66]\nHarvard's ability to fund its degree and financial aid programs depends on the performance of its endowment; a poor performance in fiscal year 2016 forced a 4.4% cut in the number of graduate students funded by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.[67]\nEndowment income is critical, as only 22% of revenue is from students' tuition, fees, room, and board.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Divestment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Financial endowment § Criticism and reforms\n\nSince the 1970s, several student-led campaigns have advocated divesting Harvard's endowment from controversial holdings, including investments in apartheid South Africa, Sudan during the Darfur genocide, and the tobacco, fossil fuel, and private prison industries.[69][70]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, during the divestment from South Africa movement, student activists erected a symbolic \"shantytown\" on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown.[71][72]\nThe university eventually reduced its South African holdings by $230 million (out of $400 million) in response to the pressure.[71][73]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Teaching and learning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Massachusetts Hall (1720), Harvard's oldest building[74]\n![](image)Harvard Yard\nHarvard is a large, highly residential research university[75]\noffering 50 undergraduate majors,[76]\n134 graduate degrees,[77]\nand 32 professional degrees.[78]\nDuring the 2018–2019 academic year, Harvard granted 1,665 baccalaureate degrees, 1,013 graduate degrees, and 5,695 professional degrees.[78]\n\n\nHarvard College, the four-year, full-time undergraduate program, has a liberal arts and sciences focus.[75][76]\nTo graduate in the usual four years, undergraduates normally take four courses per semester.[79]\nIn most majors, an honors degree requires advanced coursework and a senior thesis.[80]\nThough some introductory courses have large enrollments, the median class size is 12 students.[81]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nHarvard is a founding member of the Association of American Universities[82] and a preeminent research university with \"very high\" research activity (R1) and comprehensive doctoral programs across the arts, sciences, engineering, and medicine according to the Carnegie Classification.[75]\n\n\nWith the medical school consistently ranking first among medical schools for research,[83] biomedical research is an area of particular strength for the university. More than 11,000 faculty and over 1,600 graduate students conduct research at the medical school as well as its 15 affiliated hospitals and research institutes.[84] The medical school and its affiliates attracted $1.65 billion in competitive research grants from the National Institutes of Health in 2019, more than twice as much as any other university.[85]\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Widener Library anchors the Harvard Library system.\n![](image)Henry Moore's sculpture *Large Four Piece Reclining Figure*, near Lamont Library\nThe Harvard Library system is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard and comprises nearly 80 individual libraries holding about 20.4 million items.[16][17][19] According to the American Library Association, this makes it the largest academic library in the world.[17][5]\n\n\nHoughton Library, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials. America's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public. The largest collection of East-Asian language material outside of East Asia is held in the Harvard-Yenching Library\n\n\nThe Harvard Art Museums comprise three museums. The Arthur M. Sackler Museum covers Asian, Mediterranean, and Islamic art, the Busch–Reisinger Museum (formerly the Germanic Museum) covers central and northern European art, and the Fogg Museum covers Western art from the Middle Ages to the present emphasizing Italian early Renaissance, British pre-Raphaelite, and 19th-century French art. The Harvard Museum of Natural History includes the Harvard Mineralogical Museum, the Harvard University Herbaria featuring the Blaschka Glass Flowers exhibit, and the Museum of Comparative Zoology.

The Graduate Council represents students at all twelve graduate and professional schools, most of which also have their own student government.[117]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard Crimson\n\nBoth the undergraduate College and the graduate schools have intramural sports programs.\n\n\nHarvard College competes in the NCAA Division I Ivy League conference. The school fields 42 intercollegiate sports teams, more than any other college in the country.[118] Every two years, the Harvard and Yale track and field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford and Cambridge team in the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.[119] As with other Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships.[120] The school color is crimson.\n\n\nHarvard's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875.[121]\n\n\n\n## *Harvard University Gazette*[edit]\n\n\nThe *Harvard Gazette*, also called the ***Harvard University Gazette***, is the official press organ of Harvard University. Formerly a print publication, it is now a web site. It publicizes research, faculty, teaching and events at the university. Initiated in 1906, it was originally a weekly calendar of news and events. In 1968 it became a weekly newspaper.\n\n\nWhen the *Gazette* was a print publication, it was considered a good way of keeping up with Harvard news: \"If weekly reading suits you best, the most comprehensive and authoritative medium is the *Harvard University Gazette*\".\n\n\nIn 2010, the *Gazette* \"shifted from a print-first to a digital-first and mobile-first\" publication, and reduced its publication calendar to biweekly, while keeping the same number of reporters, including some who had previously worked for the *Boston Globe*, *Miami Herald*, and the Associated Press.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images**.

Founded in 1636 as Harvard College and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard, it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[9]\n\n\nHarvard's founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature, \"dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches\"; though never formally affiliated with any denomination, in its early years, Harvard College primarily trained Congregational clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.\n\n\nThe university is composed of ten academic faculties plus the Harvard Radcliffe Institute. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate academic disciplines, and other faculties offer only graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard has three main campuses:[13]\nthe 209-acre (85 ha) Cambridge campus centered on Harvard Yard; an adjoining campus immediately across Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical campus in Boston's Longwood Medical Area.[14] Harvard's endowment is valued at $50.7 billion, making it the wealthiest academic institution in the world.[3][4] Endowment income enables the undergraduate college to admit students regardless of financial need and provide financial aid with no loans.[15] Harvard Library is the world's largest academic library system, comprising 79 individual libraries holding 20 million items.[16][17][18][19]\n\n\nThroughout its existence, Harvard alumni, faculty, and researchers have included 188 living billionaires, 8 U.S. presidents, numerous heads of state, Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, members of Congress, MacArthur Fellows, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Turing Award Recipients and Fulbright Scholars; by most metrics, Harvard ranks among the top globally in each of these categories.[Notes 1] Additionally, students and alumni have won 10 Academy Awards, 48 Pulitzer Prizes, 110 Olympic medals (46 gold), and have founded notable companies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Harvard University\n\n### Colonial era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: John Harvard (clergyman)\n\n![](image)The Harvard Corporation seal found on Harvard diplomas. *Christo et Ecclesiae* (Latin: \"For Christ and Church\") is one of Harvard's several early mottoes.[20]\n![](image)Engraving of Harvard College by Paul Revere, 1767\nHarvard was founded in 1636 during the colonial, pre-Revolutionary era by vote of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony. Its first headmaster, Nathaniel Eaton, took office the following year. In 1638, the university acquired British North America's first known printing press.[21][22]\n\n\nIn 1639, it was named Harvard College after John Harvard, an English clergyman who had died soon after immigrating to Massachusetts, bequeathing it £780 and his library of some 320 volumes.[23] The charter creating Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.\n\n\nA 1643 publication defined the college's purpose: \"to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust.\"[24] The college trained many Puritan ministers in its early years[25] and offered a classic curriculum based on the English university model—many leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge‍—‌conformed to the tenets of Puritanism. Harvard never affiliated with any particular denomination.[26]\n\n\nIncrease Mather served as Harvard College's president from 1681 to 1701. In 1708, John Leverett became the first president who was not also a clergyman.[27]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Harvard statue on Harvard Yard\nIn the 19th century, Enlightenment ideas of reason and free will were widespread among Congregational ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations at odds with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties.[28]: 1–4 When Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and President Joseph Willard died a year later, a struggle broke out over their replacements. Henry Ware was elected Hollis chair in 1805, and liberal Samuel Webber was appointed president two years later, signaling a shift from traditional ideas at Harvard to liberal, Arminian ideas.[28]: 4–5[29]: 24\n\n\nCharles William Eliot, Harvard president from 1869 to 1909, decreased the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. Though Eliot was an influential figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated more by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions influenced by William Ellery Channing, Ralph Waldo Emerson and others of the time, than by secularism.[30]\n\n\nIn 1816, Harvard launched new programs in the study of French and Spanish with George Ticknor as first professor for these language programs.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1906 watercolor painting of the campus, facing northeast[31]\nHarvard's graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers in the late 19th century. During World War II, students at Radcliffe College (which, since its 1879 founding, had been paying Harvard professors to repeat their lectures for women) began attending Harvard classes alongside men.[32] In 1945, women were first admitted to the medical school.[33]\nSince 1971, Harvard had controlled essentially all aspects of undergraduate admission, instruction, and housing for Radcliffe women; in 1999, Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard.[34]\n\n\nIn the 20th century, Harvard's reputation grew as its endowment burgeoned and prominent intellectuals and professors affiliated with the university. The university's rapid enrollment growth also was a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the undergraduate college. Radcliffe College emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities.[12]\n\n\nThe student body in its first decades of the 20th century was predominantly \"old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians\", according to sociologist and author Jerome Karabel.[35] In 1923, a year after the percentage of Jewish students at Harvard reached 20%, President A. Lawrence Lowell supported a policy change that would have capped the admission of Jewish students to 15% of the undergraduate population. But Lowell's idea was rejected. Lowell also refused to mandate forced desegregation in the university's freshman dormitories, writing that, \"We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man, but we do not owe to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial.\"[36][37][38][39]\n\n\nPresident James B. Conant led the university from 1933 to 1953; Conant reinvigorated creative scholarship in an effort to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among the nation and world's emerging research institutions. Conant viewed higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy. As such, he devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. An influential 268-page report issued by Harvard faculty in 1945 under Conant's leadership, *General Education in a Free Society*, remains one the most important works in curriculum studies.[40]\n\n\nBetween 1945 and 1960, admissions standardized to open the university to a more diverse group of students; for example, after World War II, special exams were developed so veterans could be considered for admission.[41] No longer drawing mostly from select New England prep schools, the undergraduate college became accessible to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but still few Blacks, Hispanics, or Asians versus the representation of these groups in the general population.[42] Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, Harvard incrementally became vastly more diverse.[43]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nDrew Gilpin Faust, who was dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute, became Harvard's first female president on July 1, 2007.[44] In 2018, Faust retired and joined the board of Goldman Sachs.\n\n\nOn July 1, 2018, Lawrence Bacow was appointed Harvard's 29th president.[45] Bacow intends to retire in 2023. \n\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Claudine Gay, a Harvard University political scientist and former dean of Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, succeeded Bacow as the university's 30th president.\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Hall\n### Cambridge[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Graduate School of Design, Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Radcliffe Institute\n\nHarvard's 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard (\"the Yard\") in Cambridge, about 3 miles (5 km) west-northwest of downtown Boston, and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood. The Yard contains administrative offices such as University Hall and Massachusetts Hall; libraries such as Widener, Pusey, Houghton, and Lamont; and Memorial Church.\n\n\n\nThe Yard and adjacent areas include the main academic buildings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including the college, such as Sever Hall and Harvard Hall.\n\n![](image)Memorial ChurchFreshman dormitories are in, or adjacent to, the Yard. Upperclassmen live in the twelve residential houses – nine south of the Yard near the Charles River, the others half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Radcliffe Quadrangle (which formerly housed Radcliffe College students). Each house is a community of undergraduates, faculty deans, and resident tutors, with its own dining hall, library, and recreational facilities.[46]\n\n\nAlso in Cambridge are the Law, Divinity (theology), Engineering and Applied Science, Design (architecture), Education, Kennedy (public policy), and Extension schools, as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Radcliffe Yard.[47]\nHarvard also has commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Allston[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard University's expansion in Allston, Massachusetts\n\nHarvard Business School, Harvard Innovation Labs, and many athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a 358-acre (145 ha) campus in Allston,[50]\na Boston neighborhood just across the Charles River from the Cambridge campus. The John W. Weeks Bridge, a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River, connects the two campuses.\n\n\nThe university is actively expanding into Allston, where it now owns more land than in Cambridge.[51]\nPlans include new construction and renovation for the Business School, a hotel and conference center, graduate student housing, Harvard Stadium, and other athletics facilities.[52]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will expanded into a new, 500,000+ square foot Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) in Allston.[53]\nThe SEC will be adjacent to the Enterprise Research Campus, the Business School, and the Harvard Innovation Labs to encourage technology- and life science-focused startups as well as collaborations with mature companies.[54]\n\n\n\n### Longwood[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Longwood Medical and Academic Area\n\n![](image)Harvard Medical School\nThe schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Public Health are located on a 21-acre (8.5 ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area in Boston, about 3.3 miles (5.3 km) south of the Cambridge campus.[14]\nSeveral Harvard-affiliated hospitals and research institutes are also in Longwood, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, Joslin Diabetes Center, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. Additional affiliates, most notably Massachusetts General Hospital, are located throughout the Greater Boston area.\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nHarvard owns the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, D.C., Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts, the Concord Field Station in Estabrook Woods in Concord, Massachusetts,[55]\nthe Villa I Tatti research center in Florence, Italy,[56]\nthe Harvard Shanghai Center in Shanghai, China,[57]\nand the Arnold Arboretum in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **School** | **Founded** |\n| Harvard College | 1636\n |\n| Medicine | 1782\n |\n| Divinity | 1816\n |\n| Law | 1817\n |\n| Engineering and Applied Sciences | 1847\n |\n| Dental Medicine | 1867\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | 1872\n |\n| Business | 1908\n |\n| Extension | 1910\n |\n| Design | 1936\n |\n| Education | 1920\n |\n| Public Health | 1913\n |\n| Government | 1936\n |\n\n\n![](image)University seal\nHarvard is governed by a combination of its Board of Overseers and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (also known as the Harvard Corporation), which in turn appoints the President of Harvard University.[58]\nThere are 16,000 staff and faculty,[59]\nincluding 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors.[60]\n\n\nThe Faculty of Arts and Sciences is the largest Harvard faculty and has primary responsibility for instruction in Harvard College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and the Division of Continuing Education, which includes Harvard Summer School and Harvard Extension School. There are nine other graduate and professional faculties as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.\n\n\nJoint programs with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, the Broad Institute, The Observatory of Economic Complexity, and edX.\n\n\n\n### Endowment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard University endowment\n\nHarvard has the largest university endowment in the world, valued at about $50.7 billion as of 2023.[3][4]\nDuring the recession of 2007–2009, it suffered significant losses that forced large budget cuts, in particular temporarily halting construction on the Allston Science Complex.[61]\nThe endowment has since recovered.[62][63][64][65]\n\n\nAbout $2 billion of investment income is annually distributed to fund operations.[66]\nHarvard's ability to fund its degree and financial aid programs depends on the performance of its endowment; a poor performance in fiscal year 2016 forced a 4.4% cut in the number of graduate students funded by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.[67]\nEndowment income is critical, as only 22% of revenue is from students' tuition, fees, room, and board.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Divestment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Financial endowment § Criticism and reforms\n\nSince the 1970s, several student-led campaigns have advocated divesting Harvard's endowment from controversial holdings, including investments in apartheid South Africa, Sudan during the Darfur genocide, and the tobacco, fossil fuel, and private prison industries.[69][70]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, during the divestment from South Africa movement, student activists erected a symbolic \"shantytown\" on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown.[71][72]\nThe university eventually reduced its South African holdings by $230 million (out of $400 million) in response to the pressure.[71][73]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Teaching and learning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Massachusetts Hall (1720), Harvard's oldest building[74]\n![](image)Harvard Yard\nHarvard is a large, highly residential research university[75]\noffering 50 undergraduate majors,[76]\n134 graduate degrees,[77]\nand 32 professional degrees.[78]\nDuring the 2018–2019 academic year, Harvard granted 1,665 baccalaureate degrees, 1,013 graduate degrees, and 5,695 professional degrees.[78]\n\n\nHarvard College, the four-year, full-time undergraduate program, has a liberal arts and sciences focus.[75][76]\nTo graduate in the usual four years, undergraduates normally take four courses per semester.[79]\nIn most majors, an honors degree requires advanced coursework and a senior thesis.[80]\nThough some introductory courses have large enrollments, the median class size is 12 students.[81]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nHarvard is a founding member of the Association of American Universities[82] and a preeminent research university with \"very high\" research activity (R1) and comprehensive doctoral programs across the arts, sciences, engineering, and medicine according to the Carnegie Classification.[75]\n\n\nWith the medical school consistently ranking first among medical schools for research,[83] biomedical research is an area of particular strength for the university. More than 11,000 faculty and over 1,600 graduate students conduct research at the medical school as well as its 15 affiliated hospitals and research institutes.[84] The medical school and its affiliates attracted $1.65 billion in competitive research grants from the National Institutes of Health in 2019, more than twice as much as any other university.[85]\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Widener Library anchors the Harvard Library system.\n![](image)Henry Moore's sculpture *Large Four Piece Reclining Figure*, near Lamont Library\nThe Harvard Library system is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard and comprises nearly 80 individual libraries holding about 20.4 million items.[16][17][19] According to the American Library Association, this makes it the largest academic library in the world.[17][5]\n\n\nHoughton Library, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials. America's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public. The largest collection of East-Asian language material outside of East Asia is held in the Harvard-Yenching Library\n\n\nThe Harvard Art Museums comprise three museums. The Arthur M. Sackler Museum covers Asian, Mediterranean, and Islamic art, the Busch–Reisinger Museum (formerly the Germanic Museum) covers central and northern European art, and the Fogg Museum covers Western art from the Middle Ages to the present emphasizing Italian early Renaissance, British pre-Raphaelite, and 19th-century French art. The Harvard Museum of Natural History includes the Harvard Mineralogical Museum, the Harvard University Herbaria featuring the Blaschka Glass Flowers exhibit, and the Museum of Comparative Zoology.

The Graduate Council represents students at all twelve graduate and professional schools, most of which also have their own student government.[117]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard Crimson\n\nBoth the undergraduate College and the graduate schools have intramural sports programs.\n\n\nHarvard College competes in the NCAA Division I Ivy League conference. The school fields 42 intercollegiate sports teams, more than any other college in the country.[118] Every two years, the Harvard and Yale track and field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford and Cambridge team in the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.[119] As with other Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships.[120] The school color is crimson.\n\n\nHarvard's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875.[121]\n\n\n\n## *Harvard University Gazette*[edit]\n\n\nThe *Harvard Gazette*, also called the ***Harvard University Gazette***, is the official press organ of Harvard University. Formerly a print publication, it is now a web site. It publicizes research, faculty, teaching and events at the university. Initiated in 1906, it was originally a weekly calendar of news and events. In 1968 it became a weekly newspaper.\n\n\nWhen the *Gazette* was a print publication, it was considered a good way of keeping up with Harvard news: \"If weekly reading suits you best, the most comprehensive and authoritative medium is the *Harvard University Gazette*\".\n\n\nIn 2010, the *Gazette* \"shifted from a print-first to a digital-first and mobile-first\" publication, and reduced its publication calendar to biweekly, while keeping the same number of reporters, including some who had previously worked for the *Boston Globe*, *Miami Herald*, and the Associated Press.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images**.

The campus occupies 8,180 acres (3,310 hectares), among the largest in the United States, and enrolls over 17,000 students.[14] Stanford has been considered to be one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[a]\n\n\nStanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland Stanford—a railroad magnate who served as the eighth governor of and then-incumbent senator from California—and his wife, Jane, in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever aged 15 the previous year.[2] The university admitted its first students on October 1, 1891,[2][3] as a coeducational and non-denominational institution. Stanford University struggled financially after Leland's death in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[15] Following World War II, Frederick Terman, the university's provost, inspired and supported faculty and graduates entrepreneurialism to build a self-sufficient local industry, which would later be known as Silicon Valley.[16]\n\n\nThe university is organized around seven schools on the same campus: three schools consisting of 45 academic departments at the undergraduate level, as well as four professional schools that focus on graduate programs in law, medicine, education, and business. The university also houses the Hoover Institution, a public policy think-tank. Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of two private institutions in the Division I FBS Pac-12 Conference. As of May 26, 2022, Stanford has won 131 NCAA team championships,[17] more than any other university, and was awarded the NACDA Directors' Cup for 25 consecutive years, beginning in 1994.[18] In addition, by 2021, Stanford students and alumni had won at least 296 Olympic medals including 150 gold and 79 silver medals.[19]\n\n\nAs of April 2021, 58 Nobel laureates, 29 Turing Award laureates,[note 1] and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with Stanford as students, alumni, faculty, or staff.[40] In addition, Stanford is particularly noted for its entrepreneurship and is one of the most successful universities in attracting funding for start-ups.[41][42][43][44][45] Stanford alumni have founded numerous companies, which combined produce more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue.[46][47][48] Stanford is the alma mater of U.S. President Herbert Hoover, the current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Rishi Sunak, 74 living billionaires, and 17 astronauts.[49] In academia, its alumni include the presidents and provosts of Yale, Harvard and Princeton. It is also one of the leading producers of Fulbright Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Gates Cambridge Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, and members of the United States Congress.[50]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Statue of the Stanford family on the Stanford University campus\n![](image)Center of the campus in 1891[51]\n![](image)Ichthyologist and founding president of Stanford, David Starr Jordan\nMain article: History of Stanford University\n\nStanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford, dedicated to the memory of Leland Stanford Jr., their only child. The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. Jane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great Eastern universities, specifically Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Stanford was referred to as the \"Cornell of the West\" in 1891 due to a majority of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates, including its first president, David Starr Jordan, and second president, John Casper Branner. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to make higher education accessible, non-sectarian, and open to women as well as men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt that radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an early adopter as well.[52]\n\n\nFrom an architectural point of view, the Stanfords, particularly Jane, wanted their university to look different from the eastern ones, which had often sought to emulate the style of English university buildings. They specified in the founding grant[53] that the buildings should \"be like the old adobe houses of the early Spanish days; they will be one-storied; they will have deep window seats and open fireplaces, and the roofs will be covered with the familiar dark red tiles.\" This guides the campus buildings to this day. The Stanfords also hired renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who previously designed the Cornell campus, to design the Stanford campus.[54]\n\n\nWhen Leland Stanford died in 1893, the continued existence of the university was in jeopardy due to a federal lawsuit against his estate, but Jane Stanford insisted the university remain in operation throughout the financial crisis.[55][56] The university suffered major damage from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; most of the damage was repaired, but a new library and gymnasium were demolished, and some original features of Memorial Church and the Quad were never restored.[57]\n\n\nDuring the early-twentieth century, the university added four professional graduate schools. Stanford University School of Medicine was established in 1908 when the university acquired Cooper Medical College in San Francisco;[58] it moved to the Stanford campus in 1959.[59] The university's law department, established as an undergraduate curriculum in 1893, was transitioned into a professional law school starting in 1908 and received accreditation from the American Bar Association in 1923.[60] The Stanford University Graduate School of Education grew out of the Department of the History and Art of Education, one of the original twenty-one departments at Stanford, and became a professional graduate school in 1917.[61] The Stanford Graduate School of Business was founded in 1925 at the urging of then-trustee Herbert Hoover.[62] In 1919, The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by Herbert Hoover to preserve artifacts related to World War I. The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)William Shockley, Stanford professor, Nobel laureate in physics, \"Father of Silicon Valley\"\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Frederick Terman, an engineering professor who later became provost, encouraged Stanford engineering graduates to start their own companies and invent products.[64] During the 1950s, he established Stanford Industrial Park, a high-tech commercial campus on university land.[65] Also in the 1950s, William Shockley, co-inventor of the silicon transistor, recipient of the 1956 Nobel Prize for Physics, and later professor of physics at Stanford, moved to the Palo Alto area and founded a company, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. The next year, eight of his employees resigned and formed a competing company, Fairchild Semiconductor. The presence of so many high-tech and semiconductor firms helped to establish Stanford and the mid-Peninsula as a hotbed of innovation, eventually named Silicon Valley after the key ingredient in transistors.[66] Shockley and Terman are often described, separately or jointly, as the \"fathers of Silicon Valley\".[67][68]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, Stanford intentionally reduced and restricted Jewish admissions, and for decades, denied and dismissed claims from students, parents, and alumni that they were doing so.[69] Stanford issued its first institutional apology to the Jewish community in 2022 after an internal task force confirmed that the university deliberately discriminated against Jewish applicants, while also misleading those who expressed concerns, including students, parents, alumni, and the ADL.[70][71]\n\n\nWallace Sterling was president 1949 to 1968. He oversaw the growth of Stanford from a financially troubled regional university to a financially sound, internationally recognized academic powerhouse, \"the Harvard of the West\".[72]\n\n\nAchievements during Sterling's tenure included:\n\n\n\n* Moving the Stanford Medical School from a small, inadequate campus in San Francisco to a new facility on the Stanford campus which was fully integrated into the university to an unusual degree for medical schools.\n* Establishing the Stanford Industrial Park (now the Stanford Research Park) and the Stanford Shopping Center on leased University land, thus stabilizing the university's finances. The Stanford Industrial Park, together with the university's aggressive pursuit of government research grants, helped to spur the development of Silicon Valley.\n* Increasing the number of students receiving financial aid from less than 5% when he took office to more than one-third when he retired.\n* Increasing the size of the student body from 8,300 to 11,300 and the size of the tenured faculty from 322 to 974.\n* Launching the PACE fundraising program, the largest such program ever undertaken by any university up to that time.\n* Launching a building boom on campus that included a new bookstore, post office, student union, dormitories, a faculty club, and many academic buildings.\n* Creating the Overseas Campus program for undergraduates in 1958.\n\n\nIn 2022, Stanford University issued a public apology for its discrimination against Jewish applicants in the 1950s, which was documented through internal memos involving Sterling.[73]\nIn the 1960s, Stanford rose from a regional university to one of the most prestigious in the United States, \"when it appeared on lists of the \"top ten\" universities in America... This swift rise to performance [was] understood at the time as related directly to the university's defense contracts...\"[74] Stanford was once considered a school for \"the wealthy\",[75] but controversies in later decades damaged its reputation. The 1971 Stanford prison experiment was criticized as unethical,[76] and the misuse of government funds from 1981 resulted in severe penalties for the school's research funding[77][78] and the resignation of Stanford President Donald Kennedy in 1992.[79]\n\n\n\n## Land[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The center of the Stanford University campus\nMost of Stanford is on an 8,180-acre (12.8 sq mi; 33.1 km2)[6] campus, one of the largest in the United States.[note 2] It is on the San Francisco Peninsula, in the northwest part of the Santa Clara Valley (Silicon Valley) approximately 37 miles (60 km) southeast of San Francisco and approximately 20 miles (30 km) northwest of San Jose. $4.5 billion was received by Stanford in 2006 and spent more than $2.1 billion in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. In 2008, 60% of this land remained undeveloped.[82]\n\n\nStanford's main campus includes a census-designated place within unincorporated Santa Clara County,[83] although some of the university land (such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park) is within the city limits of Palo Alto. The campus also includes much land in unincorporated San Mateo County (including the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve), as well as in the city limits of Menlo Park (Stanford Hills neighborhood), Woodside, and Portola Valley.[84]\n\n\nThe central campus includes a seasonal lake (Lake Lagunita, actually an irrigation reservoir), home to the vulnerable California tiger salamander. As of 2012, Lake Lagunita was often dry and the university had no plans to artificially fill it.[85] Heavy rains in January 2023 refilled Lake Lagunita (colloquially known as Lake Lag) to up to 8 feet of depth.[86] Two other reservoirs, Searsville Lake on San Francisquito Creek and Felt Lake,[87] are on more remote sections of the founding grant.\n\n\n\n### Central campus[edit]\n\n\nThe central academic campus is adjacent to Palo Alto,[88] bounded by El Camino Real, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Blvd, and Sand Hill Road. The United States Postal Service has assigned it two ZIP Codes: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for P.O. box mail. It lies within area code 650.\n\n\n\n\n![](image)\nView of the main quadrangle of Stanford with Memorial Church in the center background from across the grass-covered Oval\n\n\n### Non-central campus[edit]\n\n\nStanford currently operates in several locations beyond its central campus.\n\n\nOn the founding grant:\n\n\n\n* Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve is a 1,200-acre (490 ha) natural reserve south of the central campus owned by the university and used by wildlife biologists for research. Researchers and students are involved in biological research. Professors can teach the importance of biological research to the biological community. The primary goal is to understand the system of the natural Earth.[89]\n* SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is a facility west of the central campus operated by the university for the Department of Energy. It contains the longest linear particle accelerator in the world, 2 miles (3.2 km) on 426 acres (172 ha) of land.[90]\n\n\nOff the founding grant:\n\n\n\n* Hopkins Marine Station, in Pacific Grove, California, is a marine biology research center owned by the university since 1892. Based on US Pacific Coast, it is one of the oldest marine laboratories. It includes 10 research laboratories and is also used for archaeological exploration purposes.[91] A graduate student of the anthropology department discover some broken elements, which leads to proof that 100 years before it was home to a Chinese American fishing village.[92]\n* Study abroad locations: unlike typical study abroad programs, Stanford itself operates in several locations around the world; thus, each location has Stanford faculty-in-residence and staff in addition to students, creating a \"mini-Stanford.\"[93]\n* Redwood City campus for many of the university's administrative offices in Redwood City, California, a few miles north of the main campus. In 2005, the university purchased a small, 35-acre (14 ha) campus in Midpoint Technology Park intended for staff offices; development was delayed by The Great Recession.[94][95] In 2015 the university announced a development plan[96] and the Redwood City campus opened in March 2019.[97]\n* The Bass Center in Washington, D.C. provides a base, including housing, for the Stanford in Washington program for undergraduates.[98] It includes a small art gallery open to the public.[99]\n* China: Stanford Center at Peking University, housed in the Lee Jung Sen Building, is a small center for researchers and students in collaboration with Peking University.[100][101]\n\n\n![](image)\nLake Lagunita in winter; the Dish, a large radio telescope, and local landmark, is visible in the Stanford-owned foothills behind the lake and is the high point of a popular campus jogging and walking trail.\n\n\n### Faculty residences[edit]\n\n\nMany Stanford faculty members live in the \"Faculty Ghetto\", within walking or biking distance of campus.[102] The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned by Stanford. Similar to a condominium, the houses can be bought and sold but the land under the houses is rented on a 99-year lease. Houses in the \"Ghetto\" appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall Silicon Valley values.[103]\n\n\n\n### Other uses[edit]\n\n\nSome of the land is managed to provide revenue for the university such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park. Stanford land is also leased for a token rent by the Palo Alto Unified School District for several schools including Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School.[104] El Camino Park, the oldest Palo Alto city park, is also on Stanford land.[105] Stanford also has the Stanford Golf Course[106] and Stanford Red Barn Equestrian Center[107] used by Stanford athletics though the golf course can also be used by the general public.\n\n\n\n### Landmarks[edit]\n\n\nContemporary campus landmarks include the Main Quad and Memorial Church, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts and the Bing Concert Hall, the Stanford Mausoleum with the nearby Angel of Grief, Hoover Tower, the Rodin Sculpture Garden, the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden, the Arizona Cactus Garden, the Stanford University Arboretum, Green Library and the Dish. Frank Lloyd Wright's 1937 Hanna–Honeycomb House and the 1919 Lou Henry Hoover House are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. White Memorial Fountain (also known as \"The Claw\") between the Stanford Bookstore and the Old Union is a popular place to meet and to engage in the Stanford custom of \"fountain hopping\"; it was installed in 1964 and designed by Aristides Demetrios after a national competition as a memorial for two brothers in the class of 1949, William N. White and John B. White II, one of whom died before graduating and one shortly after in 1952.[108][109][110][111]\n\n\n\n* ![Interior of the Stanford Memorial Church at the center of the Main Quad](image)\n\nInterior of the Stanford Memorial Church at the center of the Main Quad\n* ![Hoover Tower, at 285 feet (87 m), the tallest building on campus](image)\n\nHoover Tower, at 285 feet (87 m), the tallest building on campus\n* ![The new Stanford Stadium, site of home football games](image)\n\nThe new Stanford Stadium, site of home football games\n* ![Stanford Quad with Memorial Church in the background](image)\n\nStanford Quad with Memorial Church in the background\n* ![The Dish, a 150 feet (46 m) diameter radio telescope on the Stanford foothills overlooking the main campus](image)\n\nThe Dish, a 150 feet (46 m) diameter radio telescope on the Stanford foothills overlooking the main campus\n* ![White Memorial Fountain (The Claw)](image)\n\nWhite Memorial Fountain (The Claw)\n\n\n## Administration and organization[edit]\n\n\nStanford is a private, non-profit university administered as a corporate trust governed by a privately appointed board of trustees with a maximum membership of 38.[112][note 3] Trustees serve five-year terms (not more than two consecutive terms) and meet five times annually.[115] A new trustee is chosen by the current trustees by ballot.[113] The Stanford trustees also oversee the Stanford Research Park, the Stanford Shopping Center, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University Medical Center, and many associated medical facilities (including the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital).[116]\n\n\nThe board appoints a president to serve as the chief executive officer of the university, to prescribe the duties of professors and course of study, to manage financial and business affairs, and to appoint nine vice presidents.[117] Richard Saller became the twelfth president in September 2023.[118] The provost is the chief academic and budget officer, to whom the deans of each of the seven schools report.[119][120] Jenny Martinez became the fourteenth provost in October 2023.[121]\n\n\nAs of 2022, the university is organized into seven academic schools.[122] The schools of Humanities and Sciences (twenty-seven departments),[123] Engineering (nine departments),[124] and Sustainability (nine departments)[125] have both graduate and undergraduate programs while the Schools of Law,[126] Medicine,[127] Education,[128] and Business,[129] have graduate programs only. The powers and authority of the faculty are vested in the Academic Council, which is made up of tenure and non-tenure line faculty, research faculty, senior fellows in some policy centers and institutes, the president of the university, and some other academic administrators. But most matters are handled by the Faculty Senate, made up of 54 elected representatives of the faculty for 2021.[130]\n\n\nThe Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) is the student government for Stanford and all registered students are members. Its elected leadership consists of the Undergraduate Senate elected by the undergraduate students, the Graduate Student Council elected by the graduate students, and the President and Vice President elected as a ticket by the entire student body.[131] Stanford is the beneficiary of a special clause in the California Constitution, which explicitly exempts Stanford property from taxation so long as the property is used for educational purposes.[132]\n\n\n\n### Endowment and donations[edit]\n\n\nThe university's endowment, managed by the Stanford Management Company, was valued at $36.5 billion as of August 31, 2023.[4] Payouts from the Stanford endowment covered approximately 22% of university expenses in the 2023 fiscal year.[4] In the 2018 NACUBO-TIAA survey of colleges and universities in the United States and Canada, only Harvard University, the University of Texas System, and Yale University had larger endowments than Stanford.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)The original Golden spike on display at the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University\nIn 2006, President John L. Hennessy launched a five-year campaign called the Stanford Challenge, which reached its $4.3 billion fundraising goal in 2009, two years ahead of time, but continued fundraising for the duration of the campaign. It concluded on December 31, 2011, having raised $6.23 billion and breaking the previous campaign fundraising record of $3.88 billion held by Yale.[134][135] Specifically, the campaign raised $253.7 million for undergraduate financial aid, as well as $2.33 billion for its initiative in \"Seeking Solutions\" to global problems, $1.61 billion for \"Educating Leaders\" by improving K-12 education, and $2.11 billion for \"Foundation of Excellence\" aimed at providing academic support for Stanford students and faculty. Funds supported 366 new fellowships for graduate students, 139 new endowed chairs for faculty, and 38 new or renovated buildings. The new funding also enabled the construction of a facility for stem cell research; a new campus for the business school; an expansion of the law school; a new Engineering Quad; a new art and art history building; an on-campus concert hall; the new Cantor Arts Center; and a planned expansion of the medical school, among other things.[136][137] In 2012, the university raised $1.035 billion, becoming the first school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year.[138]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Stanford University announced a $75 million donation, in support of a multidisciplinary neurodegenerative brain disease research initiative at the university's Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute. The donation came from Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife Penny; hence The Phil and Penny Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience will explore cognitive declines from diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.[139]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| First-time fall freshman statistics\n |\n| --- |\n|  | 2021[140] | 2020[141] | 2019[142] | 2018[143] | 2017[144] |\n| Applicants\n | 55,471\n | 45,227\n | 47,498\n | 47,452\n | 44,073\n |\n| Admits\n | 2,190\n | 2,349\n | 2,062\n | 2,071\n | 2,085\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 3.9%\n | 5.19%\n | 4.34%\n | 4.36%\n | 4.73%\n |\n| Enrolled\n | 1,757\n | 1,607\n | 1,701\n | 1,697\n | 1,703\n |\n| Yield | 80.23%\n | 68.41%\n | 82.49%\n | 81.94%\n | 81.68%\n |\n| SAT range\n | 1420–1570\n | 1420–1550\n | 1440–1550\n | 1420–1570\n | 1390–1540\n |\n| ACT range\n | 32–35\n | 31–35\n | 32–35\n | 32–35\n | 32–35\n |\n\n\nStanford is considered by *US News* to be 'most selective', with an acceptance rate of 4%. Half of the applicants accepted to Stanford have an SAT score between 1440 and 1570 or an ACT score of 32 and 35. Admissions officials consider a student's GPA to be an important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation.[145] In terms of non-academic materials as of 2019, Stanford ranks extracurricular activities, talent/ability and character/personal qualities as 'very important' in making first-time, first-year admission decisions, while ranking the interview, whether the applicant is a first-generation university applicant, legacy preferences, volunteer work and work experience as 'considered'.[142] Of those students accepted to Stanford's Class of 2026, 1,736 chose to attend, of which 21% were first-generation college students.\n\n\nStanford's admission process is need-blind for U.S. citizens and permanent residents;[146] while it is not need-blind for international students, 64% are on need-based aid, with an average aid package of $31,411.[147] In 2012, the university awarded $126 million in need-based financial aid to 3,485 students, with an average aid package of $40,460.[147] Eighty percent of students receive some form of financial aid.[147] Stanford has a no-loan policy.[147] For undergraduates admitted starting in 2015, Stanford waives tuition, room, and board for most families with incomes below $65,000, and most families with incomes below $125,000 are not required to pay tuition; those with incomes up to $150,000 may have tuition significantly reduced.[148] Seventeen percent of students receive Pell Grants,[147] a common measure of low-income students at a college. In 2022, Stanford started its first dual-enrollment computer science program for high school students from low-income communities[149] as a pilot project which then inspired the founding of the Qualia Global Scholars Program.[150] Stanford plans to expand the program to include courses in Structured Liberal Education and writing.[149]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and learning[edit]\n\n\nStanford follows a quarter system with the autumn quarter usually beginning in late September and the spring quarter ending in mid-June.[151] The full-time, four-year undergraduate program has arts and sciences focus with high graduate student coexistence.[151] Stanford is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges with the latest review in 2023.[152]\n\n\n\n### Research centers and institutes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hoover Tower, inspired by the cathedral tower at Salamanca in Spain\nMain article: Stanford University centers and institutes\n\nStanford is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.\"[151] The university's research expenditure in fiscal years of 2021-2022 was $1.82 billion and the total number of sponsored projects was 7,900+.[153] As of 2016, the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research oversaw eighteen independent laboratories, centers, and institutes. Kathryn Ann Moler is the key person for leading those research centers for choosing problems, faculty members, and students. Funding is also provided for undergraduate and graduate students by those labs, centers, and institutes for collaborative research.[154]\n\n\nOther Stanford-affiliated institutions include the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (originally the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), the Stanford Research Institute (an independent institution which originated at the university), the Hoover Institution (a conservative[155] think tank), and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (a multidisciplinary design school in cooperation with the Hasso Plattner Institute of University of Potsdam that integrates product design, engineering, and business management education).\n\n\nStanford is home to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute which grew out of and still contains the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, a collaboration with the King Center to publish the King papers held by the King Center.[156] It also runs the John S. Knight Fellowship for Professional Journalists and the Center for Ocean Solutions, which brings together marine science and policy to address challenges facing the ocean. It focuses mainly five points, such as climate change, overfishing, coastal development, pollution, and plastics.[157]\n\n\nTogether with UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, Stanford is part of the Biohub, a new medical science research center founded in 2016 by a $600 million commitment from Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg and pediatrician Priscilla Chan. This medical research center is working for designing advanced-level health care units.[158]\n\n\n\n### Libraries and digital resources[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Green Library\nMain article: Stanford University Libraries\n\nAs of 2014, Stanford University Libraries (SUL) has twenty-four libraries in total. The Hoover Institution Library and Archives is a research center based on history of twentieth century.[159] Stanford University Libraries (SUL) held a collection of more than 9.3 million volumes, nearly 300,000 rare or special books, 1.5 million e-books, 2.5 million audiovisual materials, 77,000 serials, nearly 6 million microform holdings, thousands of other digital resources.[160] and 516,620 journal, 526,414 images, 11,000 software collection, 1,00,000 videos etc. .[161]\n\n\nThe main library in the SU library system is the Green Library, which also contains various meeting and conference rooms, study spaces, and reading rooms. Lathrop Library (previously Meyer Library, demolished in 2015), holds various student-accessible media resources and houses one of the largest East Asia collections with 540,000 volumes. Stanford University Press, founded in 1892, published about 130 books per year has printed more than 3,000 books.[162] It also has fifteen subject areas.[163]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bronze statues by Auguste Rodin are scattered throughout the campus, including these *Burghers of Calais*.\nStanford is home to the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, a museum with twenty-four galleries, sculpture gardens, terraces, and a courtyard first established in 1891 by Jane and Leland Stanford as a memorial to their only child. The center's collection of works by Rodin is among the largest in the world.[164] The Thomas Welton Stanford Gallery, which was built in 1917, serves as a teaching resource for the Department of Art & Art History as well as an exhibition venue. In 2014, Stanford opened the Anderson Collection, a new museum focused on postwar American art and founded by the donation of 121 works by food service moguls Mary and Harry Anderson.[165][166][167] There are outdoor art installations throughout the campus, primarily sculptures, but some murals as well. The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden near Roble Hall features includes wood carvings and \"totem poles.\"\n\n\nThe Stanford music department sponsors many ensembles including five choirs, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, Stanford Taiko, and the Stanford Wind Ensemble. Extracurricular activities include theater groups such as Ram's Head Theatrical Society, the Stanford Improvisors,[168] the Stanford Shakespeare Company, and the Stanford Savoyards, a group dedicated to performing the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Stanford is also host to ten *a cappella* groups, including the Mendicants (Stanford's first),[169] Counterpoint (the first all-female group on the West Coast),[170] the Harmonics, the Stanford Fleet Street Singers,[171] Talisman, Everyday People, and Raagapella.[172]\n\n\n\n\n### Reputation and rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[173] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[174] | 3 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[175] | 1 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[176] | 2 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[177] | 2 |\n| *QS*[178] | 5 |\n| *THE*[179] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[180] | 3 |\n\n\n*Slate* in 2014 dubbed Stanford as \"the Harvard of the 21st century\".[182] In the same year *The New York Times* dubbed Harvard as the \"Stanford of the East\". In that article titled *To Young Minds of Today, Harvard Is the Stanford of the East* *The New York Times* concluded that \"Stanford University has become America's 'it' school, by measures that Harvard once dominated.\"[183] In 2019, Stanford University took 1st place on Reuters' list of the *World's Most Innovative Universities* for the fifth consecutive year.[184] In 2022, *Washington Monthly* ranked Stanford at 1st position in their annual list of top universities in the United States.[185] In a 2022 survey by *The Princeton Review*, Stanford was ranked 1st among the top ten \"dream colleges\" of America, and was considered to be the ultimate \"dream college\" of both students and parents.[186][187] Stanford Graduate School of Business was ranked 1st in the list of America's best business schools by *Bloomberg* for 2022.[188][189]\n\n\nFrom polls of college applicants done by The Princeton Review, every year from 2013 to 2020 the most commonly named \"dream college\" for students was Stanford; separately, parents, too, most frequently named Stanford their ultimate \"dream college.\"[190][191] Globally Stanford is also ranked among the top universities in the world. The *Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)* ranked Stanford second in the world (after Harvard) most years from 2003 to 2020.[192] *Times Higher Education* recognizes Stanford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Oxford.[193][194]\n\n\n\n## Discoveries and innovation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Carnegie Mellon discoveries and innovation, Illinois discoveries and innovation, MIT discoveries and innovation, and UC Berkeley discoveries and innovation\n\n### Natural sciences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Felix Bloch, physics professor, 1952 Nobel laureate for his work at Stanford\n* Biological synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) – Arthur Kornberg discovered the mechanisms in the biological synthesis of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid, and won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for his work at Stanford.[195] By studying bacteria, Kornberg succeeded in isolating DNA polymerase in 1956–an enzyme that is active in the formation of DNA.\n* First Transgenic organism – Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer were the first scientists to transplant genes from one living organism to another, a fundamental discovery for genetic engineering.[196][197] Thousands of products have been developed on the basis of their work, including human growth hormone and hepatitis B vaccine.\n* Laser – Arthur Leonard Schawlow shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Kai Siegbahn for his work on lasers.[198][199]\n* Nuclear magnetic resonance – Felix Bloch developed new methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements, which are the underlying principles of the MRI.[200][201]\n\n\n### Computer and applied sciences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vint Cerf, co-leader of the Stanford team that designed the architecture of the internet\n* ARPANET – Stanford Research Institute, formerly part of Stanford but on a separate campus, was the site of one of the four original ARPANET nodes.[202][203] In the early 1970s, Bob Kahn & Vint Cerf's research project about Internetworking, later DARPA formulated it to the TCP(Transmission Control Program).[204]\n* Internet—Stanford was the site where the original design of the Internet was undertaken. Vint Cerf led a research group to elaborate the design of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP/IP) that he originally co-created with Robert E. Kahn (Bob Kahn) in 1973 and which formed the basis for the architecture of the Internet.[205]\n* Frequency modulation synthesis – John Chowning of the Music department invented the FM music synthesis algorithm in 1967, and Stanford later licensed it to Yamaha Corporation.[206][207]\n* Google – Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, when they were both PhD students at Stanford.[208] They were working on the Stanford Digital Library Project (SDLP) which is started in 1999. The SDLP's goal was \"to develop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and universal digital library\"[209] and it was funded through the National Science Foundation, among other federal agencies.[210] Today, Google stands as one of the most valuable brands in the world.\n* Klystron tube – invented by the brothers Russell and Sigurd Varian at Stanford.[211] Their prototype was completed and demonstrated successfully on August 30, 1937.[212] Upon publication in 1939, news of the klystron immediately influenced the work of U.S. and UK researchers working on radar equipment.[213][214]\n* RISC – ARPA funded VLSI project of microprocessor design. Stanford and UC Berkeley are most associated with the popularization of this concept. The Stanford MIPS would go on to be commercialized as the successful MIPS architecture, while Berkeley RISC gave its name to the entire concept, commercialized as the SPARC. Another success from this era were IBM's efforts that eventually led to the IBM POWER instruction set architecture, PowerPC, and Power ISA. As these projects matured, a wide variety of similar designs flourished in the late 1980s and especially the early 1990s, representing a major force in the Unix workstation market as well as embedded processors in laser printers, routers and similar products.[215]\n* SUN workstation – Andy Bechtolsheim designed the SUN workstation,[216] for the Stanford University Network communications project as a personal CAD workstation,[217] which led to Sun Microsystems.\n\n\n### Businesses and entrepreneurship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of companies founded by Stanford University alumni\n\nStanford is one of the most successful universities in creating companies and licensing its inventions to existing companies, and it is often considered a model for technology transfer.[41][42] Stanford's Office of Technology Licensing is responsible for commercializing university research, intellectual property, and university-developed projects. The university is described as having a strong venture culture in which students are encouraged, and often funded, to launch their own companies.[43] Companies founded by Stanford alumni generate more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue and have created some 5.4 million jobs since the 1930s.[218] When combined, these companies would form the tenth-largest economy in the world.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image) ![](image)\nCo-founders of Hewlett-Packard, Bill Hewlett (BS 1934), left, and David Packard (BA 1934), right\n\nSome companies closely associated with Stanford and their connections include:\n\n\n\n* Hewlett-Packard, 1939: co-founders William R.

Women made up 50.4% of undergraduates and 41.5% of graduate students.[147] In the same academic year, the freshman retention rate was 99%. Stanford awarded 1,819 undergraduate degrees, 2,393 master's degrees, 770 doctoral degrees, and 3270 professional degrees in the 2018–2019 school year.[147] The four-year graduation rate for the class of 2017 cohort was 72.9%, and the six-year rate was 94.4%.[147] The relatively low four-year graduation rate is a function of the university's coterminal degree (or \"coterm\") program, which allows students to earn a master's degree as a 1-to-2-year extension of their undergraduate program.[232] As of 2010, fifteen percent of undergraduates were first-generation students.[233]\n\n\n\n### Dormitories and student housing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Stanford University student housing\n\nAs of 2013, 89% of undergraduate students lived in on-campus university housing. First-year undergraduates are required to live on campus, and all undergraduates are guaranteed housing for all four undergraduate years.[147][234] Undergraduates live in 80 different houses, including dormitories, co-ops, row houses, and fraternities and sororities.[235] At Manzanita Park, 118 mobile homes were installed as \"temporary\" housing from 1969 to 1991, but as of 2015 was the site of newer dorms Castano, Kimball, Lantana, and the Humanities House, completed in 2015.[236][237]\n\n\nMost student residences are just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries. Some are reserved for freshmen, sophomores, or upper-class students and some are open to all four classes. Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male fraternities, three are all-female sororities, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House. In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but a few dorms are configured for men and women to live on separate floors (single-gender floors).[238]\n\n\n\n![](image)Many students use bicycles to get around the large campus.\nSeveral residences are considered theme houses. The Academic, Language, and Culture Houses include EAST (Education and Society Themed House), Hammarskjöld (International Themed House), Haus Mitteleuropa (Central European Themed House), La Casa Italiana (Italian Language and Culture), La Maison Française (French Language and Culture House), Slavianskii Dom (Slavic/East European Themed House), Storey (Human Biology Themed House), and Yost (Spanish Language and Culture). Cross-Cultural Themed Houses include Casa Zapata (Chicano/Latino Theme in Stern Hall), Muwekma-tah-ruk (American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Themed House), Okada (Asian-American Themed House in Wilbur Hall), and Ujamaa (Black/African-American Themed House in Lagunita Court). Focus Houses include Freshman-Sophomore College (Academic Focus), Branner Hall (Community Service), Kimball (Arts & Performing Arts), Crothers (Global Citizenship), and Toyon (Sophomore Priority).[235] Theme houses predating the current \"theme\" classification system are Columbae (Social Change Through Nonviolence, since 1970),[239] and Synergy (Exploring Alternatives, since 1972).[240]\n\n\nCo-ops or \"Self-Ops\" are another housing option. These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces. These houses have unique themes around which their community is centered. Many co-ops are hubs of music, art and philosophy. The co-ops on campus are 576 Alvarado Row (formerly Chi Theta Chi), Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskjöld, Kairos, Terra (the unofficial LGBT house),[241] and Synergy.[242] Phi Sigma, at 1018 Campus Drive was formerly Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, but in 1973 became a Self-Op.[243]\n\n\nAs of 2015, around 55 percent of the graduate student population lived on campus.[244] First-year graduate students are guaranteed on-campus housing. Stanford also subsidizes off-campus apartments in nearby Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Mountain View for graduate students who are guaranteed on-campus housing but are unable to live on campus due to a lack of space.[245]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Stanford Cardinal\n\n![](image)The Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band rallies football fans with arrangements of \"All Right Now\" and other contemporary music\nAs of 2016, Stanford had sixteen male varsity sports and twenty female varsity sports,[246] nineteen club sports[247] and about 27 intramural sports[248] In 1930, following a unanimous vote by the executive committee for the Associated Students, the athletic department adopted the mascot \"Indian.\" The Indian symbol and name were dropped by President Richard Lyman in 1972, after objections from Native American students and a vote by the student senate.[249] The sports teams are now officially referred to as the \"Stanford Cardinal,\" referring to the deep red color, not the cardinal bird. Stanford is a member of the Pac-12 Conference in most sports, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in several other sports, and the America East Conference in field hockey[250] with the participation in the inter-collegiate NCAA's Division I FBS.\n\n\nIts traditional sports rival is the University of California, Berkeley, the neighbor to the north in the East Bay. The winner of the annual \"Big Game\" between the Cal and Cardinal football teams gains custody of the Stanford Axe.[251] As of May 9, 2022, Stanford has won 130 NCAA team championships, more than any other school. Stanford has won at least one NCAA team championship each academic year for 46 consecutive years, starting in 1976–77 and continuing through 2021–22.[252] The second-longest NCAA championship streak was nineteen years, achieved by USC from 1959 to 1960 through 1977–78. As of January 1, 2022, Stanford athletes have won 529 NCAA individual championships. No other Division I school is within 100 of Stanford's total.[253] Stanford won 25 consecutive NACDA Directors' Cups, from 1994 to 1995 through 2018–19, awarded annually to the most successful overall college sports program in the nation.[252]\n\n\n177 Stanford-affiliated athletes have won a total of 296 Summer Olympic medals (150 gold, 79 silver, 67 bronze), including 26 medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and 27 medals at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.[252] In the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Stanford-affiliated athletes won 26 medals, more than any other university.[254] Stanford athletes have won medals in every Summer Olympic Games since 1912.\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\n* \"Hail, Stanford, Hail!\" is the Stanford hymn sometimes sung at ceremonies or adapted by the various university singing groups. It was written in 1892 by mechanical engineering professor Albert W. Smith and his wife, Mary Roberts Smith (in 1896 she earned the first Stanford doctorate in economics and later became associate professor of sociology), but was not officially adopted until after a performance on campus in March 1902 by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.[255][256]\n* Big Game: The central football rivalry between Stanford and UC Berkeley. First played in 1892, and for a time played by the universities' rugby teams, it is one of the oldest college rivalries in the United States.\n* The Stanford Axe: A trophy earned by the winner of Big Game, exchanged only as necessary. The axe originated in 1899 when Stanford yell leader Billy Erb wielded a lumberman's axe to inspire the team. Stanford lost, and the Axe was stolen by Berkeley students following the game. In 1930, Stanford students staged an elaborate heist to recover the Axe. In 1933, the schools agreed to exchange it as a prize for winning Big Game. As of 2021, a restaurant centrally located on Stanford's campus is named \"The Axe and Palm\" in reference to the Axe.[257]\n* Big Game Gaieties: In the week ahead of Big Game, a 90-minute original musical (written, composed, produced, and performed by the students of Ram's Head Theatrical Society) is performed in Memorial Auditorium.[258]\n* Full Moon on the Quad: An annual event at Main Quad, where students gather to kiss one another starting at midnight. Typically organized by the junior class cabinet, the festivities include live entertainment, such as music and dance performances.[259]\n* The Stanford Marriage Pact: An annual matchmaking event where thousands of students complete a questionnaire about their values and are subsequently matched with the best person for them to make a \"marriage pact\" with.[260][261][262][263]\n* Fountain Hopping: At any time of year, students tour Stanford's main campus fountains to dip their feet or swim in some of the university's 25 fountains.[259][264][265]\n* Mausoleum Party: An annual Halloween party at the Stanford Mausoleum, the final resting place of Leland Stanford Jr. and his parents. A 20-year tradition, the Mausoleum party was on hiatus from 2002 to 2005 due to a lack of funding, but was revived in 2006.[259][266] In 2008, it was hosted in Old Union rather than at the actual Mausoleum, because rain prohibited generators from being rented.[267] In 2009, after fundraising efforts by the Junior Class Presidents and the ASSU Executive, the event was able to return to the Mausoleum despite facing budget cuts earlier in the year.[268]\n* Wacky Walk: At commencement, graduates forgo a more traditional entrance and instead stride into Stanford Stadium in a large procession wearing wacky costumes.[265][269]\n* Steam Tunneling: Stanford has a network of underground brick-lined tunnels that conduct central heating to more than 200 buildings via steam pipes. Students sometimes navigate the corridors, rooms, and locked gates, carrying flashlights and water bottles.[270] *Stanford Magazine* named steam tunneling one of the \"101 things you must do\" before graduating from the Farm in 2000.[271]\n* Band Run: An annual festivity at the beginning of the school year, where the band picks up freshmen from dorms across campus while stopping to perform at each location, culminating in a finale performance at Main Quad.[259]\n* Viennese Ball: a formal ball with waltzes that was initially started in the 1970s by students returning from the now-closed (since 1987) Stanford in Vienna overseas program.[272] It is now open to all students.\n* The long-unofficial motto of Stanford, selected by President Jordan, is \"*Die Luft der Freiheit weht.*\"[273] Translated from the German language, this quotation from Ulrich von Hutten means, \"The wind of freedom blows.\" The motto was controversial during World War I, when anything in German was suspect; at that time the university disavowed that this motto was official.[1] It was made official by way of incorporation into an official seal by the board of trustees in December 2002.[274]\n* Degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman: Stanford does not award honorary degrees,[275][276] but in 1953 the \"degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman\" was created by Stanford Associates, part of the Stanford alumni organization, to recognize alumni who give rare and extraordinary service to the university. It is awarded not at prescribed intervals, but instead only when the president of the university deems it appropriate to recognize extraordinary service. Recipients include Herbert Hoover, Bill Hewlett, Dave Packard, Lucile Packard, and John Gardner.[277]\n* Former campus traditions include the Big Game bonfire on Lake Lagunita (a seasonal lake usually dry in the fall), which was formally ended in 1997 because of the presence of endangered salamanders in the lake bed.[278]\n\n\n### Religious life[edit]\n\n\nStudents and staff at Stanford are of many different religions. The Stanford Office for Religious Life's mission is \"to guide, nurture and enhance spiritual, religious and ethical life within the Stanford University community\" by promoting enriching dialogue, meaningful ritual, and enduring friendships among people of all religious backgrounds. It is headed by a dean with the assistance of a senior associate dean and an associate dean.\nStanford Memorial Church, in the center of campus, has a Sunday University Public Worship service (UPW) usually in the \"Protestant Ecumenical Christian\" tradition where the Memorial Church Choir sings and a sermon is preached usually by one of the Stanford deans for Religious Life. UPW sometimes has multifaith services.[279] In addition, the church is used by the Catholic community and by some of the other Christian denominations at Stanford. Weddings happen most Saturdays and the university has for over twenty years allowed blessings of same-gender relationships and now legal weddings.\n\n\nIn addition to the church, the Office for Religious Life has a Center for Inter-Religious Community, Learning, and Experiences (CIRCLE) on the third floor of Old Union. It offers a common room, an interfaith sanctuary, a seminar room, a student lounge area, and a reading room, as well as offices housing a number of Stanford Associated Religions (SAR) member groups and the Senior Associate Dean and Associate Dean for Religious Life. Most though not all religious student groups belong to SAR. The SAR directory includes organizations that serve atheist, Bahá’í, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islam, Jewish, and Sikh groups, though these groups vary year by year.[280]\nThe Windhover Contemplation Center was dedicated in October 2014, and was intended to provide spiritual sanctuary for students and staff in the midst of their course and work schedules; the center displays the \"Windhover\" paintings by Nathan Oliveira, the late Stanford professor and artist.[281] Some religions have a larger and more formal presence on campus in addition to the student groups; these include the Catholic Community at Stanford[282] and Hillel at Stanford.[283]\n\n\n\n### Greek life[edit]\n\n\nFraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891 when the university first opened. In 1944, University President Donald Tresidder banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.[284] However, following Title IX, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.[285] Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or sorority until spring quarter of their freshman year.[286]\n\n\nAs of 2016, Stanford had thirty-one Greek organizations, including fourteen sororities and sixteen fraternities. Nine of the Greek organizations were housed (eight in University-owned houses and one, Sigma Chi, in their own house, although the land is owned by the university).[287] Five chapters were members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, eleven chapters were members of the Interfraternity Council, seven chapters belonged to the Intersorority Council, and six chapters belonged to the Multicultural Greek Council.[288]\n\n\n\n* Stanford is home to two unhoused historically National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC or \"Divine Nine\") sororities (Alpha Kappa Alpha, and Delta Sigma Theta) and two unhoused NPHC fraternities (Alpha Phi Alpha and Kappa Alpha Psi). These fraternities and sororities operate under the African American Fraternal Sororal Association (AAFSA) at Stanford.[289]\n* Seven historically National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) sororities, four of which are unhoused (Alpha Phi, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Chi Omega, and Kappa Kappa Gamma) and three of which are housed (Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Pi Beta Phi) call Stanford home. These sororities operate under the Stanford Inter-sorority Council (ISC).[290]\n* Eleven historically National Interfraternity Conference (NIC) fraternities are also represented at Stanford, including five unhoused fraternities (Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Tau Delta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Kappa Alpha Order), and four housed fraternities (Sigma Phi Epsilon, Kappa Sigma, Phi Kappa Psi, and Sigma Nu). These fraternities operate under the Stanford Inter-fraternity Council (IFC).[291]\n* There are also four unhoused Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) sororities on campus (alpha Kappa Delta Phi, Lambda Theta Nu, Sigma Psi Zeta, and Sigma Theta Psi), as well as two unhoused MGC fraternities (Gamma Zeta Alpha and Lambda Phi Epsilon). Lambda Phi Epsilon is recognized by the National Interfraternity Conference (NIC).[292]\n\n\n### Student groups[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Students on an urban hike organized by the Graduate Student Programming Board (GSPB)\nAs of 2020, Stanford had more than 600 student organizations.[293] Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the university via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include \"special fees,\" which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body. Groups span athletics and recreation, careers/pre-professional, community service, ethnic/cultural, fraternities and sororities, health and counseling, media and publications, the arts, political and social awareness, and religious and philosophical organizations. In contrast to many other selective universities, Stanford policy mandates that all recognized student clubs be \"broadly open\" for all interested students to join.[294][295][296][297]\n\n\nStanford is home to a set of student journalism publications. *The Stanford Daily* is a student-run daily newspaper and has been published since the university was founded in 1892.[298] The student-run radio station, KZSU Stanford 90.1 FM, features freeform music programming, sports commentary, and news segments; it started in 1947 as an AM radio station.[299] The Stanford Review is a conservative student newspaper founded in 1987.[300] *The Fountain Hopper* (*FoHo*) is a financially independent, anonymous student-run campus rag publication, notable for having broken the Brock Turner story.[301] Stanford hosts numerous environmental and sustainability-oriented student groups, including Students for a Sustainable Stanford, Students for Environmental and Racial Justice, and Stanford Energy Club.[302] Stanford is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[303]\n\n\nStanford is also home to a large number of pre-professional student organizations, organized around missions from startup incubation to paid consulting. The Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students (BASES) is one of the largest professional organizations in Silicon Valley, with over 5,000 members.[304] Its goal is to support the next generation of entrepreneurs.[305] StartX is a non-profit startup accelerator for student and faculty-led startups.[306] It is staffed primarily by students.[307] Stanford Women In Business (SWIB) is an on-campus business organization, aimed at helping Stanford women find paths to success in the generally male-dominated technology industry.[308] Stanford Marketing is a student group that provides students hands-on training through research and strategy consulting projects with Fortune 500 clients, as well as workshops led by people from industry and professors in the Stanford Graduate School of Business.[309][310] Stanford Finance provides mentoring and internships for students who want to enter a career in finance. Stanford Pre Business Association is intended to build connections among industry, alumni, and student communities.[311]\n\n\nStanford is also home to several academic groups focused on government and politics, including Stanford in Government and Stanford Women in Politics. The Stanford Society for Latin American Politics is Stanford's first student organization focused on the region's political, economic, and social developments, working to increase the representation and study of Latin America on campus. Former guest speakers include José Mujica and Gustavo Petro.[312]\n\n\nOther groups include:\n\n\n\n* The Stanford Axe Committee is the official guardian of the Stanford Axe and the rest of the time assists the Stanford Band as a supplementary spirit group. It has existed since 1982.[313]\n* Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO) which hosts the annual Stanford Powwow started in 1971. This is the largest student-run event on campus and the largest student-run powwow in the country.[314][315]\n* The Stanford Improvisors (SImps for short) teach and perform improvisational theatre on campus and in the surrounding community.[316] In 2014 the group finished second in the Golden Gate Regional College Improv tournament[317] and they have since been invited twice to perform at the annual San Francisco Improv Festival.[318]\n* Asha for Education is a national student group founded in 1991. It focuses mainly on education in India and supporting nonprofit organizations that work mainly in the education sector. Asha's Stanford chapter organizes events like Holi as well as lectures by prominent leaders from India on the university campus.[319][320][321]\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\nStanford's Department of Public Safety is responsible for law enforcement and safety on the main campus. Its deputy sheriffs are peace officers by arrangement with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office.[322] The department is also responsible for publishing an annual crime report covering the previous three years as required by the Clery Act.[323] Fire protection has been provided by contract with the Palo Alto Fire Department since 1976.[324]\n\n\nMurder is rare on the campus, although a few cases have been notorious, including the 1974 murder of Arlis Perry in Stanford Memorial Church, which was not solved until 2018.[325] Also notorious was Theodore Streleski's murder of his faculty advisor in 1978.[326]\n\n\n\n#### Campus sexual misconduct[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Stanford was the tenth highest in the nation in \"total of reports of rape\" on their main campus, with 26 reports of rape.[327] In Stanford's 2015 Campus Climate Survey, 4.7 percent of female undergraduates reported experiencing sexual assault as defined by the university, and 32.9 percent reported experiencing sexual misconduct.[328] According to the survey, 85% of perpetrators of misconduct were Stanford students and 80% were men.[328] Perpetrators of sexual misconduct were frequently aided by alcohol or drugs, according to the survey: \"Nearly three-fourths of the students whose responses were categorized as sexual assault indicated that the act was accomplished by a person or persons taking advantage of them when they were drunk or high, according to the survey. Close to 70 percent of students who reported an experience of sexual misconduct involving nonconsensual penetration and/or oral sex indicated the same.\"[328]\n\n\nAssociated Students of Stanford and student and alumni activists with the anti-rape group Stand with Leah criticized the survey methodology for downgrading incidents involving alcohol if students did not check two separate boxes indicating they were both intoxicated and incapacity while sexually assaulted.[328] Reporting on the Brock Turner rape case, a reporter from *The Washington Post* analyzed campus rape reports submitted by universities to the U.S. Department of Education, and found that Stanford was one of the top ten universities in campus rapes in 2014, with 26 reported that year, but when analyzed by rapes per 1000 students, Stanford was not among the top ten.[327]\n\n\n\n#### *People v. Turner*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: People v. Turner\n\nOn the night of January 17–18, 2015, 22-year-old Chanel Miller, who was visiting the campus to attend a party at the Kappa Alpha fraternity, was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner, a nineteen-year-old freshman student-athlete from Ohio. Two Stanford graduate students witnessed the attack and intervened; when Turner attempted to flee the two held him down on the ground until police arrived.[329] Stanford immediately referred the case to prosecutors and offered Miller counseling, and within two weeks had barred Turner from campus after conducting an investigation.[330] Turner was convicted on three felony charges in March 2016 and in June 2016 he received a jail sentence of six months and was declared a sex offender, requiring him to register as such for the rest of his life; prosecutors had sought a six-year prison sentence out of the maximum 14 years that was possible.[331] The case and the relatively lenient sentence drew nationwide attention.[332] Two years later the judge in the case, Stanford graduate Aaron Persky, was recalled by the voters.[333][334]\n\n\n\n#### Joe Lonsdale[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Elise Clougherty filed a sexual assault and harassment lawsuit against venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale.[335][336] Lonsdale and Clougherty entered into a relationship in the spring of 2012 when she was a junior and he was her mentor in a Stanford entrepreneurship course.[336] By the spring of 2013 Clougherty had broken off the relationship and filed charges at Stanford that Lonsdale had broken the Stanford policy against consensual relationships between students and faculty and that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her, which resulted in Lonsdale being banned from Stanford for 10 years.[336] Lonsdale challenged Stanford's finding that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her and Stanford rescinded that finding and the campus ban in the fall of 2015.[337] Clougherty withdrew her suit that fall as well.[338]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Stanford University people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Stanford University.\n\nAs of late 2021, Stanford had 2,288 tenure-line faculty, senior fellows, center fellows, and medical center faculty.[339]\n\n\n\n### Award laureates and scholars[edit]\n\n\nStanford's current community of scholars includes:\n\n\n\n* 22 Nobel Prize laureates (as of October 2022, 58 affiliates in total);[339]\n* 174 members of the National Academy of Sciences;[339]\n* 113 members of National Academy of Engineering;[339]\n* 90 members of National Academy of Medicine;[339]\n* 303 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences;[339]\n* 10 recipients of the National Medal of Science;[339]\n* 3 recipients of the National Medal of Technology;[339]\n* 6 recipients of the National Humanities Medal;[339]\n* 47 members of American Philosophical Society;[339]\n* 56 fellows of the American Physics Society (since 1995);[340]\n* 4 Pulitzer Prize winners;[339]\n* 33 MacArthur Fellows;[339]\n* 6 Wolf Foundation Prize winners;[339]\n* 2 ACL Lifetime Achievement Award winners;[341]\n* 14 AAAI fellows;[342]\n* 2 Presidential Medal of Freedom winners.[339][343]\n\n\nStanford's faculty and former faculty includes 48 Nobel laureates,[339] five Fields Medalists, as well as seventeen winners of the Turing Award, the so-called \"Nobel Prize in computer science\", comprising one-third of the awards given in its 44-year history. The university has 27 ACM fellows. It is also affiliated with four Gödel Prize winners, four Knuth Prize recipients, ten IJCAI Computers and Thought Award winners, and about fifteen Grace Murray Hopper Award winners for their work in the foundations of computer science. Stanford alumni have started many companies and, according to *Forbes*, has produced the second highest number of billionaires of all universities.[344][345][346] As of 2020, fifteen Stanford alumni have won the Nobel Prize.[347][348][349][350][351] As of 2022, 128 Stanford students or alumni have been named Rhodes Scholars.[352]\n\n\n\n* Notable Stanford alumni include:\n* ![Herbert Hoover (BS 1895), 31st President of the United States, founder of Hoover Institution at Stanford.

Berry College with over 26,000 acres (40.6 sq mi; 105.2 km2), Paul Smith's College with 14,200 acres (22.2 sq mi; 57.5 km2), and the United States Air Force Academy with 18,500 acres (7,500 ha) are larger but are not usually classified as universities. Duke University at 8,610 acres (13.5 sq mi; 34.8 km2) does have more land, but it is not contiguous. However, the University of the South has over 13,000 acres (20.3 sq mi; 52.6 km2).\n3. **^** The rules governing the board have changed over time. The original 24 trustees were appointed for life in 1885 by the Stanfords as were some of the subsequent replacements. In 1899 Jane Stanford changed the maximum number of trustees from 24 to 15 and set the term of office to 10 years. On June 1, 1903, she resigned her powers as founder and the board took on its full powers. In the 1950s, the board decided that its fifteen members were not sufficient to do all the work needed and in March 1954 petitioned the courts to raise the maximum number to 23, of whom 20 would be regular trustees serving 10-year terms and 3 would be alumni trustees serving 5-year terms. In 1970 another petition was successfully made to have the number raised to a maximum of 35 (with a minimum of 25), that all trustees would be regular trustees, and that the university president would be a trustee *ex officio*.[113] The last original trustee, Timothy Hopkins, died in 1936; the last life trustee, Joseph D. Grant (appointed in 1891), died in 1942.[114]\n\n1. **^** \n\n\t1. \"Rebecca S. Lowen. Creating the Cold War University: The Transformation of Stanford.

The campus occupies 8,180 acres (3,310 hectares), among the largest in the United States, and enrolls over 17,000 students.[14] Stanford has been considered to be one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[a]\n\n\nStanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland Stanford—a railroad magnate who served as the eighth governor of and then-incumbent senator from California—and his wife, Jane, in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever aged 15 the previous year.[2] The university admitted its first students on October 1, 1891,[2][3] as a coeducational and non-denominational institution. Stanford University struggled financially after Leland's death in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[15] Following World War II, Frederick Terman, the university's provost, inspired and supported faculty and graduates entrepreneurialism to build a self-sufficient local industry, which would later be known as Silicon Valley.[16]\n\n\nThe university is organized around seven schools on the same campus: three schools consisting of 45 academic departments at the undergraduate level, as well as four professional schools that focus on graduate programs in law, medicine, education, and business. The university also houses the Hoover Institution, a public policy think-tank. Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of two private institutions in the Division I FBS Pac-12 Conference. As of May 26, 2022, Stanford has won 131 NCAA team championships,[17] more than any other university, and was awarded the NACDA Directors' Cup for 25 consecutive years, beginning in 1994.[18] In addition, by 2021, Stanford students and alumni had won at least 296 Olympic medals including 150 gold and 79 silver medals.[19]\n\n\nAs of April 2021, 58 Nobel laureates, 29 Turing Award laureates,[note 1] and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with Stanford as students, alumni, faculty, or staff.[40] In addition, Stanford is particularly noted for its entrepreneurship and is one of the most successful universities in attracting funding for start-ups.[41][42][43][44][45] Stanford alumni have founded numerous companies, which combined produce more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue.[46][47][48] Stanford is the alma mater of U.S. President Herbert Hoover, the current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Rishi Sunak, 74 living billionaires, and 17 astronauts.[49] In academia, its alumni include the presidents and provosts of Yale, Harvard and Princeton. It is also one of the leading producers of Fulbright Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Gates Cambridge Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, and members of the United States Congress.[50]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Statue of the Stanford family on the Stanford University campus\n![](image)Center of the campus in 1891[51]\n![](image)Ichthyologist and founding president of Stanford, David Starr Jordan\nMain article: History of Stanford University\n\nStanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford, dedicated to the memory of Leland Stanford Jr., their only child. The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. Jane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great Eastern universities, specifically Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Stanford was referred to as the \"Cornell of the West\" in 1891 due to a majority of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates, including its first president, David Starr Jordan, and second president, John Casper Branner. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to make higher education accessible, non-sectarian, and open to women as well as men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt that radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an early adopter as well.[52]\n\n\nFrom an architectural point of view, the Stanfords, particularly Jane, wanted their university to look different from the eastern ones, which had often sought to emulate the style of English university buildings. They specified in the founding grant[53] that the buildings should \"be like the old adobe houses of the early Spanish days; they will be one-storied; they will have deep window seats and open fireplaces, and the roofs will be covered with the familiar dark red tiles.\" This guides the campus buildings to this day. The Stanfords also hired renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who previously designed the Cornell campus, to design the Stanford campus.[54]\n\n\nWhen Leland Stanford died in 1893, the continued existence of the university was in jeopardy due to a federal lawsuit against his estate, but Jane Stanford insisted the university remain in operation throughout the financial crisis.[55][56] The university suffered major damage from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; most of the damage was repaired, but a new library and gymnasium were demolished, and some original features of Memorial Church and the Quad were never restored.[57]\n\n\nDuring the early-twentieth century, the university added four professional graduate schools. Stanford University School of Medicine was established in 1908 when the university acquired Cooper Medical College in San Francisco;[58] it moved to the Stanford campus in 1959.[59] The university's law department, established as an undergraduate curriculum in 1893, was transitioned into a professional law school starting in 1908 and received accreditation from the American Bar Association in 1923.[60] The Stanford University Graduate School of Education grew out of the Department of the History and Art of Education, one of the original twenty-one departments at Stanford, and became a professional graduate school in 1917.[61] The Stanford Graduate School of Business was founded in 1925 at the urging of then-trustee Herbert Hoover.[62] In 1919, The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by Herbert Hoover to preserve artifacts related to World War I. The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)William Shockley, Stanford professor, Nobel laureate in physics, \"Father of Silicon Valley\"\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Frederick Terman, an engineering professor who later became provost, encouraged Stanford engineering graduates to start their own companies and invent products.[64] During the 1950s, he established Stanford Industrial Park, a high-tech commercial campus on university land.[65] Also in the 1950s, William Shockley, co-inventor of the silicon transistor, recipient of the 1956 Nobel Prize for Physics, and later professor of physics at Stanford, moved to the Palo Alto area and founded a company, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. The next year, eight of his employees resigned and formed a competing company, Fairchild Semiconductor. The presence of so many high-tech and semiconductor firms helped to establish Stanford and the mid-Peninsula as a hotbed of innovation, eventually named Silicon Valley after the key ingredient in transistors.[66] Shockley and Terman are often described, separately or jointly, as the \"fathers of Silicon Valley\".[67][68]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, Stanford intentionally reduced and restricted Jewish admissions, and for decades, denied and dismissed claims from students, parents, and alumni that they were doing so.[69] Stanford issued its first institutional apology to the Jewish community in 2022 after an internal task force confirmed that the university deliberately discriminated against Jewish applicants, while also misleading those who expressed concerns, including students, parents, alumni, and the ADL.[70][71]\n\n\nWallace Sterling was president 1949 to 1968. He oversaw the growth of Stanford from a financially troubled regional university to a financially sound, internationally recognized academic powerhouse, \"the Harvard of the West\".[72]\n\n\nAchievements during Sterling's tenure included:\n\n\n\n* Moving the Stanford Medical School from a small, inadequate campus in San Francisco to a new facility on the Stanford campus which was fully integrated into the university to an unusual degree for medical schools.\n* Establishing the Stanford Industrial Park (now the Stanford Research Park) and the Stanford Shopping Center on leased University land, thus stabilizing the university's finances. The Stanford Industrial Park, together with the university's aggressive pursuit of government research grants, helped to spur the development of Silicon Valley.\n* Increasing the number of students receiving financial aid from less than 5% when he took office to more than one-third when he retired.\n* Increasing the size of the student body from 8,300 to 11,300 and the size of the tenured faculty from 322 to 974.\n* Launching the PACE fundraising program, the largest such program ever undertaken by any university up to that time.\n* Launching a building boom on campus that included a new bookstore, post office, student union, dormitories, a faculty club, and many academic buildings.\n* Creating the Overseas Campus program for undergraduates in 1958.\n\n\nIn 2022, Stanford University issued a public apology for its discrimination against Jewish applicants in the 1950s, which was documented through internal memos involving Sterling.[73]\nIn the 1960s, Stanford rose from a regional university to one of the most prestigious in the United States, \"when it appeared on lists of the \"top ten\" universities in America... This swift rise to performance [was] understood at the time as related directly to the university's defense contracts...\"[74] Stanford was once considered a school for \"the wealthy\",[75] but controversies in later decades damaged its reputation. The 1971 Stanford prison experiment was criticized as unethical,[76] and the misuse of government funds from 1981 resulted in severe penalties for the school's research funding[77][78] and the resignation of Stanford President Donald Kennedy in 1992.[79]\n\n\n\n## Land[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The center of the Stanford University campus\nMost of Stanford is on an 8,180-acre (12.8 sq mi; 33.1 km2)[6] campus, one of the largest in the United States.[note 2] It is on the San Francisco Peninsula, in the northwest part of the Santa Clara Valley (Silicon Valley) approximately 37 miles (60 km) southeast of San Francisco and approximately 20 miles (30 km) northwest of San Jose. $4.5 billion was received by Stanford in 2006 and spent more than $2.1 billion in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. In 2008, 60% of this land remained undeveloped.[82]\n\n\nStanford's main campus includes a census-designated place within unincorporated Santa Clara County,[83] although some of the university land (such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park) is within the city limits of Palo Alto. The campus also includes much land in unincorporated San Mateo County (including the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve), as well as in the city limits of Menlo Park (Stanford Hills neighborhood), Woodside, and Portola Valley.[84]\n\n\nThe central campus includes a seasonal lake (Lake Lagunita, actually an irrigation reservoir), home to the vulnerable California tiger salamander. As of 2012, Lake Lagunita was often dry and the university had no plans to artificially fill it.[85] Heavy rains in January 2023 refilled Lake Lagunita (colloquially known as Lake Lag) to up to 8 feet of depth.[86] Two other reservoirs, Searsville Lake on San Francisquito Creek and Felt Lake,[87] are on more remote sections of the founding grant.\n\n\n\n### Central campus[edit]\n\n\nThe central academic campus is adjacent to Palo Alto,[88] bounded by El Camino Real, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Blvd, and Sand Hill Road. The United States Postal Service has assigned it two ZIP Codes: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for P.O. box mail. It lies within area code 650.\n\n\n\n\n![](image)\nView of the main quadrangle of Stanford with Memorial Church in the center background from across the grass-covered Oval\n\n\n### Non-central campus[edit]\n\n\nStanford currently operates in several locations beyond its central campus.\n\n\nOn the founding grant:\n\n\n\n* Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve is a 1,200-acre (490 ha) natural reserve south of the central campus owned by the university and used by wildlife biologists for research. Researchers and students are involved in biological research. Professors can teach the importance of biological research to the biological community. The primary goal is to understand the system of the natural Earth.[89]\n* SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is a facility west of the central campus operated by the university for the Department of Energy. It contains the longest linear particle accelerator in the world, 2 miles (3.2 km) on 426 acres (172 ha) of land.[90]\n\n\nOff the founding grant:\n\n\n\n* Hopkins Marine Station, in Pacific Grove, California, is a marine biology research center owned by the university since 1892. Based on US Pacific Coast, it is one of the oldest marine laboratories. It includes 10 research laboratories and is also used for archaeological exploration purposes.[91] A graduate student of the anthropology department discover some broken elements, which leads to proof that 100 years before it was home to a Chinese American fishing village.[92]\n* Study abroad locations: unlike typical study abroad programs, Stanford itself operates in several locations around the world; thus, each location has Stanford faculty-in-residence and staff in addition to students, creating a \"mini-Stanford.\"[93]\n* Redwood City campus for many of the university's administrative offices in Redwood City, California, a few miles north of the main campus. In 2005, the university purchased a small, 35-acre (14 ha) campus in Midpoint Technology Park intended for staff offices; development was delayed by The Great Recession.[94][95] In 2015 the university announced a development plan[96] and the Redwood City campus opened in March 2019.[97]\n* The Bass Center in Washington, D.C. provides a base, including housing, for the Stanford in Washington program for undergraduates.[98] It includes a small art gallery open to the public.[99]\n* China: Stanford Center at Peking University, housed in the Lee Jung Sen Building, is a small center for researchers and students in collaboration with Peking University.[100][101]\n\n\n![](image)\nLake Lagunita in winter; the Dish, a large radio telescope, and local landmark, is visible in the Stanford-owned foothills behind the lake and is the high point of a popular campus jogging and walking trail.\n\n\n### Faculty residences[edit]\n\n\nMany Stanford faculty members live in the \"Faculty Ghetto\", within walking or biking distance of campus.[102] The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned by Stanford. Similar to a condominium, the houses can be bought and sold but the land under the houses is rented on a 99-year lease. Houses in the \"Ghetto\" appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall Silicon Valley values.[103]\n\n\n\n### Other uses[edit]\n\n\nSome of the land is managed to provide revenue for the university such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park. Stanford land is also leased for a token rent by the Palo Alto Unified School District for several schools including Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School.[104] El Camino Park, the oldest Palo Alto city park, is also on Stanford land.[105] Stanford also has the Stanford Golf Course[106] and Stanford Red Barn Equestrian Center[107] used by Stanford athletics though the golf course can also be used by the general public.\n\n\n\n### Landmarks[edit]\n\n\nContemporary campus landmarks include the Main Quad and Memorial Church, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts and the Bing Concert Hall, the Stanford Mausoleum with the nearby Angel of Grief, Hoover Tower, the Rodin Sculpture Garden, the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden, the Arizona Cactus Garden, the Stanford University Arboretum, Green Library and the Dish. Frank Lloyd Wright's 1937 Hanna–Honeycomb House and the 1919 Lou Henry Hoover House are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. White Memorial Fountain (also known as \"The Claw\") between the Stanford Bookstore and the Old Union is a popular place to meet and to engage in the Stanford custom of \"fountain hopping\"; it was installed in 1964 and designed by Aristides Demetrios after a national competition as a memorial for two brothers in the class of 1949, William N. White and John B. White II, one of whom died before graduating and one shortly after in 1952.[108][109][110][111]\n\n\n\n* ![Interior of the Stanford Memorial Church at the center of the Main Quad](image)\n\nInterior of the Stanford Memorial Church at the center of the Main Quad\n* ![Hoover Tower, at 285 feet (87 m), the tallest building on campus](image)\n\nHoover Tower, at 285 feet (87 m), the tallest building on campus\n* ![The new Stanford Stadium, site of home football games](image)\n\nThe new Stanford Stadium, site of home football games\n* ![Stanford Quad with Memorial Church in the background](image)\n\nStanford Quad with Memorial Church in the background\n* ![The Dish, a 150 feet (46 m) diameter radio telescope on the Stanford foothills overlooking the main campus](image)\n\nThe Dish, a 150 feet (46 m) diameter radio telescope on the Stanford foothills overlooking the main campus\n* ![White Memorial Fountain (The Claw)](image)\n\nWhite Memorial Fountain (The Claw)\n\n\n## Administration and organization[edit]\n\n\nStanford is a private, non-profit university administered as a corporate trust governed by a privately appointed board of trustees with a maximum membership of 38.[112][note 3] Trustees serve five-year terms (not more than two consecutive terms) and meet five times annually.[115] A new trustee is chosen by the current trustees by ballot.[113] The Stanford trustees also oversee the Stanford Research Park, the Stanford Shopping Center, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University Medical Center, and many associated medical facilities (including the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital).[116]\n\n\nThe board appoints a president to serve as the chief executive officer of the university, to prescribe the duties of professors and course of study, to manage financial and business affairs, and to appoint nine vice presidents.[117] Richard Saller became the twelfth president in September 2023.[118] The provost is the chief academic and budget officer, to whom the deans of each of the seven schools report.[119][120] Jenny Martinez became the fourteenth provost in October 2023.[121]\n\n\nAs of 2022, the university is organized into seven academic schools.[122] The schools of Humanities and Sciences (twenty-seven departments),[123] Engineering (nine departments),[124] and Sustainability (nine departments)[125] have both graduate and undergraduate programs while the Schools of Law,[126] Medicine,[127] Education,[128] and Business,[129] have graduate programs only. The powers and authority of the faculty are vested in the Academic Council, which is made up of tenure and non-tenure line faculty, research faculty, senior fellows in some policy centers and institutes, the president of the university, and some other academic administrators. But most matters are handled by the Faculty Senate, made up of 54 elected representatives of the faculty for 2021.[130]\n\n\nThe Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) is the student government for Stanford and all registered students are members. Its elected leadership consists of the Undergraduate Senate elected by the undergraduate students, the Graduate Student Council elected by the graduate students, and the President and Vice President elected as a ticket by the entire student body.[131] Stanford is the beneficiary of a special clause in the California Constitution, which explicitly exempts Stanford property from taxation so long as the property is used for educational purposes.[132]\n\n\n\n### Endowment and donations[edit]\n\n\nThe university's endowment, managed by the Stanford Management Company, was valued at $36.5 billion as of August 31, 2023.[4] Payouts from the Stanford endowment covered approximately 22% of university expenses in the 2023 fiscal year.[4] In the 2018 NACUBO-TIAA survey of colleges and universities in the United States and Canada, only Harvard University, the University of Texas System, and Yale University had larger endowments than Stanford.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)The original Golden spike on display at the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University\nIn 2006, President John L. Hennessy launched a five-year campaign called the Stanford Challenge, which reached its $4.3 billion fundraising goal in 2009, two years ahead of time, but continued fundraising for the duration of the campaign. It concluded on December 31, 2011, having raised $6.23 billion and breaking the previous campaign fundraising record of $3.88 billion held by Yale.[134][135] Specifically, the campaign raised $253.7 million for undergraduate financial aid, as well as $2.33 billion for its initiative in \"Seeking Solutions\" to global problems, $1.61 billion for \"Educating Leaders\" by improving K-12 education, and $2.11 billion for \"Foundation of Excellence\" aimed at providing academic support for Stanford students and faculty. Funds supported 366 new fellowships for graduate students, 139 new endowed chairs for faculty, and 38 new or renovated buildings. The new funding also enabled the construction of a facility for stem cell research; a new campus for the business school; an expansion of the law school; a new Engineering Quad; a new art and art history building; an on-campus concert hall; the new Cantor Arts Center; and a planned expansion of the medical school, among other things.[136][137] In 2012, the university raised $1.035 billion, becoming the first school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year.[138]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Stanford University announced a $75 million donation, in support of a multidisciplinary neurodegenerative brain disease research initiative at the university's Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute. The donation came from Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife Penny; hence The Phil and Penny Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience will explore cognitive declines from diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.[139]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| First-time fall freshman statistics\n |\n| --- |\n|  | 2021[140] | 2020[141] | 2019[142] | 2018[143] | 2017[144] |\n| Applicants\n | 55,471\n | 45,227\n | 47,498\n | 47,452\n | 44,073\n |\n| Admits\n | 2,190\n | 2,349\n | 2,062\n | 2,071\n | 2,085\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 3.9%\n | 5.19%\n | 4.34%\n | 4.36%\n | 4.73%\n |\n| Enrolled\n | 1,757\n | 1,607\n | 1,701\n | 1,697\n | 1,703\n |\n| Yield | 80.23%\n | 68.41%\n | 82.49%\n | 81.94%\n | 81.68%\n |\n| SAT range\n | 1420–1570\n | 1420–1550\n | 1440–1550\n | 1420–1570\n | 1390–1540\n |\n| ACT range\n | 32–35\n | 31–35\n | 32–35\n | 32–35\n | 32–35\n |\n\n\nStanford is considered by *US News* to be 'most selective', with an acceptance rate of 4%. Half of the applicants accepted to Stanford have an SAT score between 1440 and 1570 or an ACT score of 32 and 35. Admissions officials consider a student's GPA to be an important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation.[145] In terms of non-academic materials as of 2019, Stanford ranks extracurricular activities, talent/ability and character/personal qualities as 'very important' in making first-time, first-year admission decisions, while ranking the interview, whether the applicant is a first-generation university applicant, legacy preferences, volunteer work and work experience as 'considered'.[142] Of those students accepted to Stanford's Class of 2026, 1,736 chose to attend, of which 21% were first-generation college students.\n\n\nStanford's admission process is need-blind for U.S. citizens and permanent residents;[146] while it is not need-blind for international students, 64% are on need-based aid, with an average aid package of $31,411.[147] In 2012, the university awarded $126 million in need-based financial aid to 3,485 students, with an average aid package of $40,460.[147] Eighty percent of students receive some form of financial aid.[147] Stanford has a no-loan policy.[147] For undergraduates admitted starting in 2015, Stanford waives tuition, room, and board for most families with incomes below $65,000, and most families with incomes below $125,000 are not required to pay tuition; those with incomes up to $150,000 may have tuition significantly reduced.[148] Seventeen percent of students receive Pell Grants,[147] a common measure of low-income students at a college. In 2022, Stanford started its first dual-enrollment computer science program for high school students from low-income communities[149] as a pilot project which then inspired the founding of the Qualia Global Scholars Program.[150] Stanford plans to expand the program to include courses in Structured Liberal Education and writing.[149]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and learning[edit]\n\n\nStanford follows a quarter system with the autumn quarter usually beginning in late September and the spring quarter ending in mid-June.[151] The full-time, four-year undergraduate program has arts and sciences focus with high graduate student coexistence.[151] Stanford is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges with the latest review in 2023.[152]\n\n\n\n### Research centers and institutes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hoover Tower, inspired by the cathedral tower at Salamanca in Spain\nMain article: Stanford University centers and institutes\n\nStanford is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.\"[151] The university's research expenditure in fiscal years of 2021-2022 was $1.82 billion and the total number of sponsored projects was 7,900+.[153] As of 2016, the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research oversaw eighteen independent laboratories, centers, and institutes. Kathryn Ann Moler is the key person for leading those research centers for choosing problems, faculty members, and students. Funding is also provided for undergraduate and graduate students by those labs, centers, and institutes for collaborative research.[154]\n\n\nOther Stanford-affiliated institutions include the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (originally the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), the Stanford Research Institute (an independent institution which originated at the university), the Hoover Institution (a conservative[155] think tank), and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (a multidisciplinary design school in cooperation with the Hasso Plattner Institute of University of Potsdam that integrates product design, engineering, and business management education).\n\n\nStanford is home to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute which grew out of and still contains the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, a collaboration with the King Center to publish the King papers held by the King Center.[156] It also runs the John S. Knight Fellowship for Professional Journalists and the Center for Ocean Solutions, which brings together marine science and policy to address challenges facing the ocean. It focuses mainly five points, such as climate change, overfishing, coastal development, pollution, and plastics.[157]\n\n\nTogether with UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, Stanford is part of the Biohub, a new medical science research center founded in 2016 by a $600 million commitment from Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg and pediatrician Priscilla Chan. This medical research center is working for designing advanced-level health care units.[158]\n\n\n\n### Libraries and digital resources[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Green Library\nMain article: Stanford University Libraries\n\nAs of 2014, Stanford University Libraries (SUL) has twenty-four libraries in total. The Hoover Institution Library and Archives is a research center based on history of twentieth century.[159] Stanford University Libraries (SUL) held a collection of more than 9.3 million volumes, nearly 300,000 rare or special books, 1.5 million e-books, 2.5 million audiovisual materials, 77,000 serials, nearly 6 million microform holdings, thousands of other digital resources.[160] and 516,620 journal, 526,414 images, 11,000 software collection, 1,00,000 videos etc. .[161]\n\n\nThe main library in the SU library system is the Green Library, which also contains various meeting and conference rooms, study spaces, and reading rooms. Lathrop Library (previously Meyer Library, demolished in 2015), holds various student-accessible media resources and houses one of the largest East Asia collections with 540,000 volumes. Stanford University Press, founded in 1892, published about 130 books per year has printed more than 3,000 books.[162] It also has fifteen subject areas.[163]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bronze statues by Auguste Rodin are scattered throughout the campus, including these *Burghers of Calais*.\nStanford is home to the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, a museum with twenty-four galleries, sculpture gardens, terraces, and a courtyard first established in 1891 by Jane and Leland Stanford as a memorial to their only child. The center's collection of works by Rodin is among the largest in the world.[164] The Thomas Welton Stanford Gallery, which was built in 1917, serves as a teaching resource for the Department of Art & Art History as well as an exhibition venue. In 2014, Stanford opened the Anderson Collection, a new museum focused on postwar American art and founded by the donation of 121 works by food service moguls Mary and Harry Anderson.[165][166][167] There are outdoor art installations throughout the campus, primarily sculptures, but some murals as well. The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden near Roble Hall features includes wood carvings and \"totem poles.\"\n\n\nThe Stanford music department sponsors many ensembles including five choirs, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, Stanford Taiko, and the Stanford Wind Ensemble. Extracurricular activities include theater groups such as Ram's Head Theatrical Society, the Stanford Improvisors,[168] the Stanford Shakespeare Company, and the Stanford Savoyards, a group dedicated to performing the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Stanford is also host to ten *a cappella* groups, including the Mendicants (Stanford's first),[169] Counterpoint (the first all-female group on the West Coast),[170] the Harmonics, the Stanford Fleet Street Singers,[171] Talisman, Everyday People, and Raagapella.[172]\n\n\n\n\n### Reputation and rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[173] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[174] | 3 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[175] | 1 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[176] | 2 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[177] | 2 |\n| *QS*[178] | 5 |\n| *THE*[179] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[180] | 3 |\n\n\n*Slate* in 2014 dubbed Stanford as \"the Harvard of the 21st century\".[182] In the same year *The New York Times* dubbed Harvard as the \"Stanford of the East\". In that article titled *To Young Minds of Today, Harvard Is the Stanford of the East* *The New York Times* concluded that \"Stanford University has become America's 'it' school, by measures that Harvard once dominated.\"[183] In 2019, Stanford University took 1st place on Reuters' list of the *World's Most Innovative Universities* for the fifth consecutive year.[184] In 2022, *Washington Monthly* ranked Stanford at 1st position in their annual list of top universities in the United States.[185] In a 2022 survey by *The Princeton Review*, Stanford was ranked 1st among the top ten \"dream colleges\" of America, and was considered to be the ultimate \"dream college\" of both students and parents.[186][187] Stanford Graduate School of Business was ranked 1st in the list of America's best business schools by *Bloomberg* for 2022.[188][189]\n\n\nFrom polls of college applicants done by The Princeton Review, every year from 2013 to 2020 the most commonly named \"dream college\" for students was Stanford; separately, parents, too, most frequently named Stanford their ultimate \"dream college.\"[190][191] Globally Stanford is also ranked among the top universities in the world. The *Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)* ranked Stanford second in the world (after Harvard) most years from 2003 to 2020.[192] *Times Higher Education* recognizes Stanford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Oxford.[193][194]\n\n\n\n## Discoveries and innovation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Carnegie Mellon discoveries and innovation, Illinois discoveries and innovation, MIT discoveries and innovation, and UC Berkeley discoveries and innovation\n\n### Natural sciences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Felix Bloch, physics professor, 1952 Nobel laureate for his work at Stanford\n* Biological synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) – Arthur Kornberg discovered the mechanisms in the biological synthesis of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid, and won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for his work at Stanford.[195] By studying bacteria, Kornberg succeeded in isolating DNA polymerase in 1956–an enzyme that is active in the formation of DNA.\n* First Transgenic organism – Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer were the first scientists to transplant genes from one living organism to another, a fundamental discovery for genetic engineering.[196][197] Thousands of products have been developed on the basis of their work, including human growth hormone and hepatitis B vaccine.\n* Laser – Arthur Leonard Schawlow shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Kai Siegbahn for his work on lasers.[198][199]\n* Nuclear magnetic resonance – Felix Bloch developed new methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements, which are the underlying principles of the MRI.[200][201]\n\n\n### Computer and applied sciences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vint Cerf, co-leader of the Stanford team that designed the architecture of the internet\n* ARPANET – Stanford Research Institute, formerly part of Stanford but on a separate campus, was the site of one of the four original ARPANET nodes.[202][203] In the early 1970s, Bob Kahn & Vint Cerf's research project about Internetworking, later DARPA formulated it to the TCP(Transmission Control Program).[204]\n* Internet—Stanford was the site where the original design of the Internet was undertaken. Vint Cerf led a research group to elaborate the design of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP/IP) that he originally co-created with Robert E. Kahn (Bob Kahn) in 1973 and which formed the basis for the architecture of the Internet.[205]\n* Frequency modulation synthesis – John Chowning of the Music department invented the FM music synthesis algorithm in 1967, and Stanford later licensed it to Yamaha Corporation.[206][207]\n* Google – Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, when they were both PhD students at Stanford.[208] They were working on the Stanford Digital Library Project (SDLP) which is started in 1999. The SDLP's goal was \"to develop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and universal digital library\"[209] and it was funded through the National Science Foundation, among other federal agencies.[210] Today, Google stands as one of the most valuable brands in the world.\n* Klystron tube – invented by the brothers Russell and Sigurd Varian at Stanford.[211] Their prototype was completed and demonstrated successfully on August 30, 1937.[212] Upon publication in 1939, news of the klystron immediately influenced the work of U.S. and UK researchers working on radar equipment.[213][214]\n* RISC – ARPA funded VLSI project of microprocessor design. Stanford and UC Berkeley are most associated with the popularization of this concept. The Stanford MIPS would go on to be commercialized as the successful MIPS architecture, while Berkeley RISC gave its name to the entire concept, commercialized as the SPARC. Another success from this era were IBM's efforts that eventually led to the IBM POWER instruction set architecture, PowerPC, and Power ISA. As these projects matured, a wide variety of similar designs flourished in the late 1980s and especially the early 1990s, representing a major force in the Unix workstation market as well as embedded processors in laser printers, routers and similar products.[215]\n* SUN workstation – Andy Bechtolsheim designed the SUN workstation,[216] for the Stanford University Network communications project as a personal CAD workstation,[217] which led to Sun Microsystems.\n\n\n### Businesses and entrepreneurship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of companies founded by Stanford University alumni\n\nStanford is one of the most successful universities in creating companies and licensing its inventions to existing companies, and it is often considered a model for technology transfer.[41][42] Stanford's Office of Technology Licensing is responsible for commercializing university research, intellectual property, and university-developed projects. The university is described as having a strong venture culture in which students are encouraged, and often funded, to launch their own companies.[43] Companies founded by Stanford alumni generate more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue and have created some 5.4 million jobs since the 1930s.[218] When combined, these companies would form the tenth-largest economy in the world.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image) ![](image)\nCo-founders of Hewlett-Packard, Bill Hewlett (BS 1934), left, and David Packard (BA 1934), right\n\nSome companies closely associated with Stanford and their connections include:\n\n\n\n* Hewlett-Packard, 1939: co-founders William R.

Women made up 50.4% of undergraduates and 41.5% of graduate students.[147] In the same academic year, the freshman retention rate was 99%. Stanford awarded 1,819 undergraduate degrees, 2,393 master's degrees, 770 doctoral degrees, and 3270 professional degrees in the 2018–2019 school year.[147] The four-year graduation rate for the class of 2017 cohort was 72.9%, and the six-year rate was 94.4%.[147] The relatively low four-year graduation rate is a function of the university's coterminal degree (or \"coterm\") program, which allows students to earn a master's degree as a 1-to-2-year extension of their undergraduate program.[232] As of 2010, fifteen percent of undergraduates were first-generation students.[233]\n\n\n\n### Dormitories and student housing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Stanford University student housing\n\nAs of 2013, 89% of undergraduate students lived in on-campus university housing. First-year undergraduates are required to live on campus, and all undergraduates are guaranteed housing for all four undergraduate years.[147][234] Undergraduates live in 80 different houses, including dormitories, co-ops, row houses, and fraternities and sororities.[235] At Manzanita Park, 118 mobile homes were installed as \"temporary\" housing from 1969 to 1991, but as of 2015 was the site of newer dorms Castano, Kimball, Lantana, and the Humanities House, completed in 2015.[236][237]\n\n\nMost student residences are just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries. Some are reserved for freshmen, sophomores, or upper-class students and some are open to all four classes. Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male fraternities, three are all-female sororities, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House. In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but a few dorms are configured for men and women to live on separate floors (single-gender floors).[238]\n\n\n\n![](image)Many students use bicycles to get around the large campus.\nSeveral residences are considered theme houses. The Academic, Language, and Culture Houses include EAST (Education and Society Themed House), Hammarskjöld (International Themed House), Haus Mitteleuropa (Central European Themed House), La Casa Italiana (Italian Language and Culture), La Maison Française (French Language and Culture House), Slavianskii Dom (Slavic/East European Themed House), Storey (Human Biology Themed House), and Yost (Spanish Language and Culture). Cross-Cultural Themed Houses include Casa Zapata (Chicano/Latino Theme in Stern Hall), Muwekma-tah-ruk (American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Themed House), Okada (Asian-American Themed House in Wilbur Hall), and Ujamaa (Black/African-American Themed House in Lagunita Court). Focus Houses include Freshman-Sophomore College (Academic Focus), Branner Hall (Community Service), Kimball (Arts & Performing Arts), Crothers (Global Citizenship), and Toyon (Sophomore Priority).[235] Theme houses predating the current \"theme\" classification system are Columbae (Social Change Through Nonviolence, since 1970),[239] and Synergy (Exploring Alternatives, since 1972).[240]\n\n\nCo-ops or \"Self-Ops\" are another housing option. These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces. These houses have unique themes around which their community is centered. Many co-ops are hubs of music, art and philosophy. The co-ops on campus are 576 Alvarado Row (formerly Chi Theta Chi), Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskjöld, Kairos, Terra (the unofficial LGBT house),[241] and Synergy.[242] Phi Sigma, at 1018 Campus Drive was formerly Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, but in 1973 became a Self-Op.[243]\n\n\nAs of 2015, around 55 percent of the graduate student population lived on campus.[244] First-year graduate students are guaranteed on-campus housing. Stanford also subsidizes off-campus apartments in nearby Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Mountain View for graduate students who are guaranteed on-campus housing but are unable to live on campus due to a lack of space.[245]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Stanford Cardinal\n\n![](image)The Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band rallies football fans with arrangements of \"All Right Now\" and other contemporary music\nAs of 2016, Stanford had sixteen male varsity sports and twenty female varsity sports,[246] nineteen club sports[247] and about 27 intramural sports[248] In 1930, following a unanimous vote by the executive committee for the Associated Students, the athletic department adopted the mascot \"Indian.\" The Indian symbol and name were dropped by President Richard Lyman in 1972, after objections from Native American students and a vote by the student senate.[249] The sports teams are now officially referred to as the \"Stanford Cardinal,\" referring to the deep red color, not the cardinal bird. Stanford is a member of the Pac-12 Conference in most sports, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in several other sports, and the America East Conference in field hockey[250] with the participation in the inter-collegiate NCAA's Division I FBS.\n\n\nIts traditional sports rival is the University of California, Berkeley, the neighbor to the north in the East Bay. The winner of the annual \"Big Game\" between the Cal and Cardinal football teams gains custody of the Stanford Axe.[251] As of May 9, 2022, Stanford has won 130 NCAA team championships, more than any other school. Stanford has won at least one NCAA team championship each academic year for 46 consecutive years, starting in 1976–77 and continuing through 2021–22.[252] The second-longest NCAA championship streak was nineteen years, achieved by USC from 1959 to 1960 through 1977–78. As of January 1, 2022, Stanford athletes have won 529 NCAA individual championships. No other Division I school is within 100 of Stanford's total.[253] Stanford won 25 consecutive NACDA Directors' Cups, from 1994 to 1995 through 2018–19, awarded annually to the most successful overall college sports program in the nation.[252]\n\n\n177 Stanford-affiliated athletes have won a total of 296 Summer Olympic medals (150 gold, 79 silver, 67 bronze), including 26 medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and 27 medals at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.[252] In the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Stanford-affiliated athletes won 26 medals, more than any other university.[254] Stanford athletes have won medals in every Summer Olympic Games since 1912.\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\n* \"Hail, Stanford, Hail!\" is the Stanford hymn sometimes sung at ceremonies or adapted by the various university singing groups. It was written in 1892 by mechanical engineering professor Albert W. Smith and his wife, Mary Roberts Smith (in 1896 she earned the first Stanford doctorate in economics and later became associate professor of sociology), but was not officially adopted until after a performance on campus in March 1902 by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.[255][256]\n* Big Game: The central football rivalry between Stanford and UC Berkeley. First played in 1892, and for a time played by the universities' rugby teams, it is one of the oldest college rivalries in the United States.\n* The Stanford Axe: A trophy earned by the winner of Big Game, exchanged only as necessary. The axe originated in 1899 when Stanford yell leader Billy Erb wielded a lumberman's axe to inspire the team. Stanford lost, and the Axe was stolen by Berkeley students following the game. In 1930, Stanford students staged an elaborate heist to recover the Axe. In 1933, the schools agreed to exchange it as a prize for winning Big Game. As of 2021, a restaurant centrally located on Stanford's campus is named \"The Axe and Palm\" in reference to the Axe.[257]\n* Big Game Gaieties: In the week ahead of Big Game, a 90-minute original musical (written, composed, produced, and performed by the students of Ram's Head Theatrical Society) is performed in Memorial Auditorium.[258]\n* Full Moon on the Quad: An annual event at Main Quad, where students gather to kiss one another starting at midnight. Typically organized by the junior class cabinet, the festivities include live entertainment, such as music and dance performances.[259]\n* The Stanford Marriage Pact: An annual matchmaking event where thousands of students complete a questionnaire about their values and are subsequently matched with the best person for them to make a \"marriage pact\" with.[260][261][262][263]\n* Fountain Hopping: At any time of year, students tour Stanford's main campus fountains to dip their feet or swim in some of the university's 25 fountains.[259][264][265]\n* Mausoleum Party: An annual Halloween party at the Stanford Mausoleum, the final resting place of Leland Stanford Jr. and his parents. A 20-year tradition, the Mausoleum party was on hiatus from 2002 to 2005 due to a lack of funding, but was revived in 2006.[259][266] In 2008, it was hosted in Old Union rather than at the actual Mausoleum, because rain prohibited generators from being rented.[267] In 2009, after fundraising efforts by the Junior Class Presidents and the ASSU Executive, the event was able to return to the Mausoleum despite facing budget cuts earlier in the year.[268]\n* Wacky Walk: At commencement, graduates forgo a more traditional entrance and instead stride into Stanford Stadium in a large procession wearing wacky costumes.[265][269]\n* Steam Tunneling: Stanford has a network of underground brick-lined tunnels that conduct central heating to more than 200 buildings via steam pipes. Students sometimes navigate the corridors, rooms, and locked gates, carrying flashlights and water bottles.[270] *Stanford Magazine* named steam tunneling one of the \"101 things you must do\" before graduating from the Farm in 2000.[271]\n* Band Run: An annual festivity at the beginning of the school year, where the band picks up freshmen from dorms across campus while stopping to perform at each location, culminating in a finale performance at Main Quad.[259]\n* Viennese Ball: a formal ball with waltzes that was initially started in the 1970s by students returning from the now-closed (since 1987) Stanford in Vienna overseas program.[272] It is now open to all students.\n* The long-unofficial motto of Stanford, selected by President Jordan, is \"*Die Luft der Freiheit weht.*\"[273] Translated from the German language, this quotation from Ulrich von Hutten means, \"The wind of freedom blows.\" The motto was controversial during World War I, when anything in German was suspect; at that time the university disavowed that this motto was official.[1] It was made official by way of incorporation into an official seal by the board of trustees in December 2002.[274]\n* Degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman: Stanford does not award honorary degrees,[275][276] but in 1953 the \"degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman\" was created by Stanford Associates, part of the Stanford alumni organization, to recognize alumni who give rare and extraordinary service to the university. It is awarded not at prescribed intervals, but instead only when the president of the university deems it appropriate to recognize extraordinary service. Recipients include Herbert Hoover, Bill Hewlett, Dave Packard, Lucile Packard, and John Gardner.[277]\n* Former campus traditions include the Big Game bonfire on Lake Lagunita (a seasonal lake usually dry in the fall), which was formally ended in 1997 because of the presence of endangered salamanders in the lake bed.[278]\n\n\n### Religious life[edit]\n\n\nStudents and staff at Stanford are of many different religions. The Stanford Office for Religious Life's mission is \"to guide, nurture and enhance spiritual, religious and ethical life within the Stanford University community\" by promoting enriching dialogue, meaningful ritual, and enduring friendships among people of all religious backgrounds. It is headed by a dean with the assistance of a senior associate dean and an associate dean.\nStanford Memorial Church, in the center of campus, has a Sunday University Public Worship service (UPW) usually in the \"Protestant Ecumenical Christian\" tradition where the Memorial Church Choir sings and a sermon is preached usually by one of the Stanford deans for Religious Life. UPW sometimes has multifaith services.[279] In addition, the church is used by the Catholic community and by some of the other Christian denominations at Stanford. Weddings happen most Saturdays and the university has for over twenty years allowed blessings of same-gender relationships and now legal weddings.\n\n\nIn addition to the church, the Office for Religious Life has a Center for Inter-Religious Community, Learning, and Experiences (CIRCLE) on the third floor of Old Union. It offers a common room, an interfaith sanctuary, a seminar room, a student lounge area, and a reading room, as well as offices housing a number of Stanford Associated Religions (SAR) member groups and the Senior Associate Dean and Associate Dean for Religious Life. Most though not all religious student groups belong to SAR. The SAR directory includes organizations that serve atheist, Bahá’í, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islam, Jewish, and Sikh groups, though these groups vary year by year.[280]\nThe Windhover Contemplation Center was dedicated in October 2014, and was intended to provide spiritual sanctuary for students and staff in the midst of their course and work schedules; the center displays the \"Windhover\" paintings by Nathan Oliveira, the late Stanford professor and artist.[281] Some religions have a larger and more formal presence on campus in addition to the student groups; these include the Catholic Community at Stanford[282] and Hillel at Stanford.[283]\n\n\n\n### Greek life[edit]\n\n\nFraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891 when the university first opened. In 1944, University President Donald Tresidder banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.[284] However, following Title IX, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.[285] Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or sorority until spring quarter of their freshman year.[286]\n\n\nAs of 2016, Stanford had thirty-one Greek organizations, including fourteen sororities and sixteen fraternities. Nine of the Greek organizations were housed (eight in University-owned houses and one, Sigma Chi, in their own house, although the land is owned by the university).[287] Five chapters were members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, eleven chapters were members of the Interfraternity Council, seven chapters belonged to the Intersorority Council, and six chapters belonged to the Multicultural Greek Council.[288]\n\n\n\n* Stanford is home to two unhoused historically National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC or \"Divine Nine\") sororities (Alpha Kappa Alpha, and Delta Sigma Theta) and two unhoused NPHC fraternities (Alpha Phi Alpha and Kappa Alpha Psi). These fraternities and sororities operate under the African American Fraternal Sororal Association (AAFSA) at Stanford.[289]\n* Seven historically National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) sororities, four of which are unhoused (Alpha Phi, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Chi Omega, and Kappa Kappa Gamma) and three of which are housed (Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Pi Beta Phi) call Stanford home. These sororities operate under the Stanford Inter-sorority Council (ISC).[290]\n* Eleven historically National Interfraternity Conference (NIC) fraternities are also represented at Stanford, including five unhoused fraternities (Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Tau Delta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Kappa Alpha Order), and four housed fraternities (Sigma Phi Epsilon, Kappa Sigma, Phi Kappa Psi, and Sigma Nu). These fraternities operate under the Stanford Inter-fraternity Council (IFC).[291]\n* There are also four unhoused Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) sororities on campus (alpha Kappa Delta Phi, Lambda Theta Nu, Sigma Psi Zeta, and Sigma Theta Psi), as well as two unhoused MGC fraternities (Gamma Zeta Alpha and Lambda Phi Epsilon). Lambda Phi Epsilon is recognized by the National Interfraternity Conference (NIC).[292]\n\n\n### Student groups[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Students on an urban hike organized by the Graduate Student Programming Board (GSPB)\nAs of 2020, Stanford had more than 600 student organizations.[293] Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the university via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include \"special fees,\" which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body. Groups span athletics and recreation, careers/pre-professional, community service, ethnic/cultural, fraternities and sororities, health and counseling, media and publications, the arts, political and social awareness, and religious and philosophical organizations. In contrast to many other selective universities, Stanford policy mandates that all recognized student clubs be \"broadly open\" for all interested students to join.[294][295][296][297]\n\n\nStanford is home to a set of student journalism publications. *The Stanford Daily* is a student-run daily newspaper and has been published since the university was founded in 1892.[298] The student-run radio station, KZSU Stanford 90.1 FM, features freeform music programming, sports commentary, and news segments; it started in 1947 as an AM radio station.[299] The Stanford Review is a conservative student newspaper founded in 1987.[300] *The Fountain Hopper* (*FoHo*) is a financially independent, anonymous student-run campus rag publication, notable for having broken the Brock Turner story.[301] Stanford hosts numerous environmental and sustainability-oriented student groups, including Students for a Sustainable Stanford, Students for Environmental and Racial Justice, and Stanford Energy Club.[302] Stanford is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[303]\n\n\nStanford is also home to a large number of pre-professional student organizations, organized around missions from startup incubation to paid consulting. The Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students (BASES) is one of the largest professional organizations in Silicon Valley, with over 5,000 members.[304] Its goal is to support the next generation of entrepreneurs.[305] StartX is a non-profit startup accelerator for student and faculty-led startups.[306] It is staffed primarily by students.[307] Stanford Women In Business (SWIB) is an on-campus business organization, aimed at helping Stanford women find paths to success in the generally male-dominated technology industry.[308] Stanford Marketing is a student group that provides students hands-on training through research and strategy consulting projects with Fortune 500 clients, as well as workshops led by people from industry and professors in the Stanford Graduate School of Business.[309][310] Stanford Finance provides mentoring and internships for students who want to enter a career in finance. Stanford Pre Business Association is intended to build connections among industry, alumni, and student communities.[311]\n\n\nStanford is also home to several academic groups focused on government and politics, including Stanford in Government and Stanford Women in Politics. The Stanford Society for Latin American Politics is Stanford's first student organization focused on the region's political, economic, and social developments, working to increase the representation and study of Latin America on campus. Former guest speakers include José Mujica and Gustavo Petro.[312]\n\n\nOther groups include:\n\n\n\n* The Stanford Axe Committee is the official guardian of the Stanford Axe and the rest of the time assists the Stanford Band as a supplementary spirit group. It has existed since 1982.[313]\n* Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO) which hosts the annual Stanford Powwow started in 1971. This is the largest student-run event on campus and the largest student-run powwow in the country.[314][315]\n* The Stanford Improvisors (SImps for short) teach and perform improvisational theatre on campus and in the surrounding community.[316] In 2014 the group finished second in the Golden Gate Regional College Improv tournament[317] and they have since been invited twice to perform at the annual San Francisco Improv Festival.[318]\n* Asha for Education is a national student group founded in 1991. It focuses mainly on education in India and supporting nonprofit organizations that work mainly in the education sector. Asha's Stanford chapter organizes events like Holi as well as lectures by prominent leaders from India on the university campus.[319][320][321]\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\nStanford's Department of Public Safety is responsible for law enforcement and safety on the main campus. Its deputy sheriffs are peace officers by arrangement with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office.[322] The department is also responsible for publishing an annual crime report covering the previous three years as required by the Clery Act.[323] Fire protection has been provided by contract with the Palo Alto Fire Department since 1976.[324]\n\n\nMurder is rare on the campus, although a few cases have been notorious, including the 1974 murder of Arlis Perry in Stanford Memorial Church, which was not solved until 2018.[325] Also notorious was Theodore Streleski's murder of his faculty advisor in 1978.[326]\n\n\n\n#### Campus sexual misconduct[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Stanford was the tenth highest in the nation in \"total of reports of rape\" on their main campus, with 26 reports of rape.[327] In Stanford's 2015 Campus Climate Survey, 4.7 percent of female undergraduates reported experiencing sexual assault as defined by the university, and 32.9 percent reported experiencing sexual misconduct.[328] According to the survey, 85% of perpetrators of misconduct were Stanford students and 80% were men.[328] Perpetrators of sexual misconduct were frequently aided by alcohol or drugs, according to the survey: \"Nearly three-fourths of the students whose responses were categorized as sexual assault indicated that the act was accomplished by a person or persons taking advantage of them when they were drunk or high, according to the survey. Close to 70 percent of students who reported an experience of sexual misconduct involving nonconsensual penetration and/or oral sex indicated the same.\"[328]\n\n\nAssociated Students of Stanford and student and alumni activists with the anti-rape group Stand with Leah criticized the survey methodology for downgrading incidents involving alcohol if students did not check two separate boxes indicating they were both intoxicated and incapacity while sexually assaulted.[328] Reporting on the Brock Turner rape case, a reporter from *The Washington Post* analyzed campus rape reports submitted by universities to the U.S. Department of Education, and found that Stanford was one of the top ten universities in campus rapes in 2014, with 26 reported that year, but when analyzed by rapes per 1000 students, Stanford was not among the top ten.[327]\n\n\n\n#### *People v. Turner*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: People v. Turner\n\nOn the night of January 17–18, 2015, 22-year-old Chanel Miller, who was visiting the campus to attend a party at the Kappa Alpha fraternity, was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner, a nineteen-year-old freshman student-athlete from Ohio. Two Stanford graduate students witnessed the attack and intervened; when Turner attempted to flee the two held him down on the ground until police arrived.[329] Stanford immediately referred the case to prosecutors and offered Miller counseling, and within two weeks had barred Turner from campus after conducting an investigation.[330] Turner was convicted on three felony charges in March 2016 and in June 2016 he received a jail sentence of six months and was declared a sex offender, requiring him to register as such for the rest of his life; prosecutors had sought a six-year prison sentence out of the maximum 14 years that was possible.[331] The case and the relatively lenient sentence drew nationwide attention.[332] Two years later the judge in the case, Stanford graduate Aaron Persky, was recalled by the voters.[333][334]\n\n\n\n#### Joe Lonsdale[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Elise Clougherty filed a sexual assault and harassment lawsuit against venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale.[335][336] Lonsdale and Clougherty entered into a relationship in the spring of 2012 when she was a junior and he was her mentor in a Stanford entrepreneurship course.[336] By the spring of 2013 Clougherty had broken off the relationship and filed charges at Stanford that Lonsdale had broken the Stanford policy against consensual relationships between students and faculty and that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her, which resulted in Lonsdale being banned from Stanford for 10 years.[336] Lonsdale challenged Stanford's finding that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her and Stanford rescinded that finding and the campus ban in the fall of 2015.[337] Clougherty withdrew her suit that fall as well.[338]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Stanford University people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Stanford University.\n\nAs of late 2021, Stanford had 2,288 tenure-line faculty, senior fellows, center fellows, and medical center faculty.[339]\n\n\n\n### Award laureates and scholars[edit]\n\n\nStanford's current community of scholars includes:\n\n\n\n* 22 Nobel Prize laureates (as of October 2022, 58 affiliates in total);[339]\n* 174 members of the National Academy of Sciences;[339]\n* 113 members of National Academy of Engineering;[339]\n* 90 members of National Academy of Medicine;[339]\n* 303 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences;[339]\n* 10 recipients of the National Medal of Science;[339]\n* 3 recipients of the National Medal of Technology;[339]\n* 6 recipients of the National Humanities Medal;[339]\n* 47 members of American Philosophical Society;[339]\n* 56 fellows of the American Physics Society (since 1995);[340]\n* 4 Pulitzer Prize winners;[339]\n* 33 MacArthur Fellows;[339]\n* 6 Wolf Foundation Prize winners;[339]\n* 2 ACL Lifetime Achievement Award winners;[341]\n* 14 AAAI fellows;[342]\n* 2 Presidential Medal of Freedom winners.[339][343]\n\n\nStanford's faculty and former faculty includes 48 Nobel laureates,[339] five Fields Medalists, as well as seventeen winners of the Turing Award, the so-called \"Nobel Prize in computer science\", comprising one-third of the awards given in its 44-year history. The university has 27 ACM fellows. It is also affiliated with four Gödel Prize winners, four Knuth Prize recipients, ten IJCAI Computers and Thought Award winners, and about fifteen Grace Murray Hopper Award winners for their work in the foundations of computer science. Stanford alumni have started many companies and, according to *Forbes*, has produced the second highest number of billionaires of all universities.[344][345][346] As of 2020, fifteen Stanford alumni have won the Nobel Prize.[347][348][349][350][351] As of 2022, 128 Stanford students or alumni have been named Rhodes Scholars.[352]\n\n\n\n* Notable Stanford alumni include:\n* ![Herbert Hoover (BS 1895), 31st President of the United States, founder of Hoover Institution at Stanford.

Berry College with over 26,000 acres (40.6 sq mi; 105.2 km2), Paul Smith's College with 14,200 acres (22.2 sq mi; 57.5 km2), and the United States Air Force Academy with 18,500 acres (7,500 ha) are larger but are not usually classified as universities. Duke University at 8,610 acres (13.5 sq mi; 34.8 km2) does have more land, but it is not contiguous. However, the University of the South has over 13,000 acres (20.3 sq mi; 52.6 km2).\n3. **^** The rules governing the board have changed over time. The original 24 trustees were appointed for life in 1885 by the Stanfords as were some of the subsequent replacements. In 1899 Jane Stanford changed the maximum number of trustees from 24 to 15 and set the term of office to 10 years. On June 1, 1903, she resigned her powers as founder and the board took on its full powers. In the 1950s, the board decided that its fifteen members were not sufficient to do all the work needed and in March 1954 petitioned the courts to raise the maximum number to 23, of whom 20 would be regular trustees serving 10-year terms and 3 would be alumni trustees serving 5-year terms. In 1970 another petition was successfully made to have the number raised to a maximum of 35 (with a minimum of 25), that all trustees would be regular trustees, and that the university president would be a trustee *ex officio*.[113] The last original trustee, Timothy Hopkins, died in 1936; the last life trustee, Joseph D. Grant (appointed in 1891), died in 1942.[114]\n\n1. **^** \n\n\t1. \"Rebecca S. Lowen. Creating the Cold War University: The Transformation of Stanford.
