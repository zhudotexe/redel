She also wrote the world's longest-running play, the murder mystery *The Mousetrap*, which has been performed in the West End since 1952. A writer during the \"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\", Christie has been called the \"Queen of Crime\". She also wrote six novels under the pseudonym **Mary Westmacott**. In 1971, she was made a Dame (DBE) by Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions to literature. *Guinness World Records* lists Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time, her novels having sold more than two billion copies.\n\n\nChristie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon, and was largely home-schooled. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed in 1920 when *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, featuring detective Hercule Poirot, was published. Her first husband was Archibald Christie; they married in 1914 and had one child before divorcing in 1928. Following the breakdown of her marriage and the death of her mother in 1926 she made international headlines by going missing for eleven days. During both World Wars, she served in hospital dispensaries, acquiring a thorough knowledge of the poisons that featured in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. Following her marriage to archaeologist Max Mallowan in 1930, she spent several months each year on digs in the Middle East and used her first-hand knowledge of this profession in her fiction.\n\n\nAccording to UNESCO's Index Translationum, she remains the most-translated individual author.[1] Her novel *And Then There Were None* is one of the top-selling books of all time, with approximately 100 million copies sold. Christie's stage play *The Mousetrap* holds the world record for the longest initial run. It opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in the West End on 25 November 1952, and by 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances. The play was temporarily closed in 2020 because of COVID-19 lockdowns in London before it reopened in 2021.\n\n\nIn 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's Grand Master Award. Later that year, *Witness for the Prosecution* received an Edgar Award for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best crime writer and *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists of the Crime Writers' Association. In 2015, *And Then There Were None* was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate.[2] Many of Christie's books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and graphic novels. More than 30 feature films are based on her work.\n\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and adolescence: 1890–1907[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Christie entitled *Lost in Reverie*, by Douglas John Connah, 1894\nAgatha Mary Clarissa Miller was born on 15 September 1890, into a wealthy upper middle class family in Torquay, Devon. She was the youngest of three children born to Frederick Alvah Miller, \"a gentleman of substance\",[3] and his wife Clarissa Margaret \"Clara\" Miller, née Boehmer.[4]: 1–4[5][6][7]\n\n\nChristie's mother Clara was born in Dublin in 1854[a] to British Army officer Frederick Boehmer[10] and his wife Mary Ann Boehmer (née West). Boehmer died in Jersey in 1863,[b] leaving his widow to raise Clara and her brothers on a meagre income.[11][14]: 10 Two weeks after Boehmer's death, Mary's sister Margaret West married widowed dry goods merchant Nathaniel Frary Miller, a US citizen.[15] To assist Mary financially, they agreed to foster nine-year-old Clara; the family settled in Timperley, Cheshire.[16] Margaret and Nathaniel had no children together, but Nathaniel had a 17-year-old son, Fred Miller, from his previous marriage. Fred was born in New York City and travelled extensively after leaving his Swiss boarding school.[14]: 12 He and Clara were married in London in 1878.[4]: 2–5[5] Their first child, Margaret Frary (\"Madge\"), was born in Torquay in 1879.[4]: 6[17] The second, Louis Montant (\"Monty\"), was born in Morristown, New Jersey, in 1880,[18] while the family was on an extended visit to the United States.[12]: 7\n\n\nWhen Fred's father died in 1869,[19] he left Clara £2,000 (approximately equivalent to £230,000 in 2023); in 1881 they used this to buy the leasehold of a villa in Torquay named Ashfield.[20][21] It was here that their third and last child, Agatha, was born in 1890.[4]: 6–7[7] She described her childhood as \"very happy\".[12]: 3 The Millers lived mainly in Devon but often visited her step-grandmother/great-aunt Margaret Miller in Ealing and maternal grandmother Mary Boehmer in Bayswater.[12]: 26–31 A year was spent abroad with her family, in the French Pyrenees, Paris, Dinard, and Guernsey.[4]: 15, 24–25 Because her siblings were so much older, and there were few children in their neighbourhood, Christie spent much of her time playing alone with her pets and imaginary companions.[12]: 9–10, 86–88 She eventually made friends with other girls in Torquay, noting that \"one of the highlights of my existence\" was her appearance with them in a youth production of Gilbert and Sullivan's *The Yeomen of the Guard*, in which she played the hero, Colonel Fairfax.[4]: 23–27\n\n\n\n![Black-and-white portrait photograph of Christie as a girl](image)Christie as a girl, early 1900s\nAccording to Christie, Clara believed she should not learn to read until she was eight; thanks to her curiosity, she was reading by the age of four.[12]: 13 Her sister had been sent to a boarding school, but their mother insisted that Christie receive her education at home. As a result, her parents and sister supervised her studies in reading, writing and basic arithmetic, a subject she particularly enjoyed. They also taught her music, and she learned to play the piano and the mandolin.[4]: 8, 20–21\n\n\nChristie was a voracious reader from an early age. Among her earliest memories were of reading children's books by Mrs Molesworth and Edith Nesbit. When a little older, she moved on to the surreal verse of Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll.[4]: 18–19 As an adolescent, she enjoyed works by Anthony Hope, Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, and Alexandre Dumas.[12]: 111, 136–37 In April 1901, aged 10, she wrote her first poem, \"The Cow Slip\".[22]\n\n\nBy 1901, her father's health had deteriorated, because of what he believed were heart problems.[14]: 33 Fred died in November 1901 from pneumonia and chronic kidney disease.[23] Christie later said that her father's death when she was 11 marked the end of her childhood.[4]: 32–33\n\n\nThe family's financial situation had, by this time, worsened. Madge married the year after their father's death and moved to Cheadle, Cheshire; Monty was overseas, serving in a British regiment.[14]: 43, 49 Christie now lived alone at Ashfield with her mother. In 1902, she began attending Miss Guyer's Girls' School in Torquay but found it difficult to adjust to the disciplined atmosphere.[12]: 139 In 1905, her mother sent her to Paris, where she was educated in a series of *pensionnats* (boarding schools), focusing on voice training and piano playing. Deciding she lacked the temperament and talent, she gave up her goal of performing professionally as a concert pianist or an opera singer.[14]: 59–61\n\n\n\n### Early literary attempts, marriage, literary success: 1907–1926[edit]\n\n\nAfter completing her education, Christie returned to England to find her mother ailing. They decided to spend the northern winter of 1907–1908 in the warm climate of Egypt, which was then a regular tourist destination for wealthy Britons.[12]: 155–57 They stayed for three months at the Gezirah Palace Hotel in Cairo. Christie attended many dances and other social functions; she particularly enjoyed watching amateur polo matches. While they visited some ancient Egyptian monuments such as the Great Pyramid of Giza, she did not exhibit the great interest in archaeology and Egyptology that developed in her later years.[4]: 40–41 Returning to Britain, she continued her social activities, writing and performing in amateur theatrics. She also helped put on a play called *The Blue Beard of Unhappiness* with female friends.[4]: 45–47\n\n\nAt 18, Christie wrote her first short story, \"The House of Beauty\", while recovering in bed from an illness. It consisted of about 6,000 words about \"madness and dreams\", subjects of fascination for her. Her biographer Janet Morgan has commented that, despite \"infelicities of style\", the story was \"compelling\".[4]: 48–49 (The story became an early version of her story \"The House of Dreams\".)[24] Other stories followed, most of them illustrating her interest in spiritualism and the paranormal. These included \"The Call of Wings\" and \"The Little Lonely God\". Magazines rejected all her early submissions, made under pseudonyms (including Mac Miller, Nathaniel Miller, and Sydney West); some submissions were later revised and published under her real name, often with new titles.[4]: 49–50\n\n\n\n![](image)Christie as a young woman, 1910s\nAround the same time, Christie began work on her first novel, *Snow Upon the Desert*. Writing under the pseudonym Monosyllaba, she set the book in Cairo and drew upon her recent experiences there. She was disappointed when the six publishers she contacted declined the work.[4]: 50–51[25] Clara suggested that her daughter ask for advice from the successful novelist Eden Phillpotts, a family friend and neighbour, who responded to her enquiry, encouraged her writing, and sent her an introduction to his own literary agent, Hughes Massie, who also rejected *Snow Upon the Desert* but suggested a second novel.[4]: 51–52\n\n\nMeanwhile, Christie's social activities expanded, with country house parties, riding, hunting, dances, and roller skating.[12]: 165–66 She had short-lived relationships with four men and an engagement to another.[14]: 64–67 In October 1912, she was introduced to Archibald \"Archie\" Christie at a dance given by Lord and Lady Clifford at Ugbrooke, about 12 miles (19 km) from Torquay. The son of a barrister in the Indian Civil Service, Archie was a Royal Artillery officer who was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps in April 1913.[26] The couple quickly fell in love. Three months after their first meeting, Archie proposed marriage, and Agatha accepted.[4]: 54–63\n\n\n\n![](image)Christie as a nurse in the Voluntary Aid Detachment of the British Red Cross. She is pictured in 1915 outside her childhood home of Ashfield.\nWith the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Archie was sent to France to fight. They married on Christmas Eve 1914 at Emmanuel Church, Clifton, Bristol, close to the home of his mother and stepfather, when Archie was on home leave.[27][28] Rising through the ranks, he was posted back to Britain in September 1918 as a colonel in the Air Ministry. Christie involved herself in the war effort as a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment of the British Red Cross. From October 1914 to May 1915, then from June 1916 to September 1918, she worked 3,400 hours in the Town Hall Red Cross Hospital, Torquay, first as a nurse (unpaid) then as a dispenser at £16 (approximately equivalent to £1,130 in 2023) a year from 1917 after qualifying as an apothecary's assistant.[4]: 69[29] Her war service ended in September 1918 when Archie was reassigned to London, and they rented a flat in St. John's Wood.[4]: 73–74\n\n\nChristie had long been a fan of detective novels, having enjoyed Wilkie Collins's *The Woman in White* and *The Moonstone*, and Arthur Conan Doyle's early Sherlock Holmes stories. She wrote her first detective novel, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, in 1916. It featured Hercule Poirot, a former Belgian police officer with \"magnificent moustaches\" and a head \"exactly the shape of an egg\",[30]: 13 who had taken refuge in Britain after Germany invaded Belgium. Christie's inspiration for the character came from Belgian refugees living in Torquay, and the Belgian soldiers she helped to treat as a volunteer nurse during the First World War.[4]: 75–79[31]: 17–18 Her original manuscript was rejected by Hodder & Stoughton and Methuen. After keeping the submission for several months, John Lane at The Bodley Head offered to accept it, provided that Christie change how the solution was revealed. She did so, and signed a contract committing her next five books to The Bodley Head, which she later felt was exploitative.[4]: 79, 81–82 It was published in 1920.[22]\n\n\n\n![Black-and-white photograph of three men in suits and one woman seated in a room and looking at an open newspaper](image)Archie Christie, Major Belcher (tour leader), Mr. Bates (secretary) and Agatha Christie on the 1922 British Empire Expedition Tour\nChristie settled into married life, giving birth to her only child, Rosalind Margaret Clarissa (later Hicks), in August 1919 at Ashfield.[4]: 79[14]: 340, 349, 422 Archie left the Air Force at the end of the war and began working in the City financial sector on a relatively low salary. They still employed a maid.[4]: 80–81 Her second novel, *The Secret Adversary* (1922), featured a new detective couple Tommy and Tuppence, again published by The Bodley Head. It earned her £50 (approximately equivalent to £3,400 in 2023). A third novel, *Murder on the Links*, again featured Poirot, as did the short stories commissioned by Bruce Ingram, editor of *The Sketch* magazine, from 1923.[4]: 83 She now had no difficulty selling her work.[30]: 33\n\n\nIn 1922, the Christies joined an around-the-world promotional tour for the British Empire Exhibition, led by Major Ernest Belcher. Leaving their daughter with Agatha's mother and sister, in 10 months they travelled to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Canada.[4]: 86–103[32] They learned to surf prone in South Africa; then, in Waikiki, they were among the first Britons to surf standing up, and extended their time there by three months to practise.[33][34] She is remembered at the British Surfing Museum as having said about surfing, \"*Oh it was heaven! Nothing like rushing through the water at what seems to you a speed of about two hundred miles an hour. It is one of the most perfect physical pleasures I have known*.\"[35]\n\n\nWhen they returned to England, Archie resumed work in the city, and Christie continued to work hard at her writing. After living in a series of apartments in London, they bought a house in Sunningdale, Berkshire, which they renamed Styles after the mansion in Christie's first detective novel.[4]: 124–25[14]: 154–55\n\n\nChristie's mother, Clarissa Miller, died in April 1926. They had been exceptionally close, and the loss sent Christie into a deep depression.[14]: 168–72 In August 1926, reports appeared in the press that Christie had gone to a village near Biarritz to recuperate from a \"breakdown\" caused by \"overwork\".[36]\n\n\n\n### Disappearance: 1926[edit]\n\n\n![Newspaper article with portraits of Agatha and Archie Christie](image)*Daily Herald*, 15 December 1926, announcing that Christie had been found. Missing for 11 days, she was found at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel in Harrogate, Yorkshire\nIn August 1926, Archie asked Agatha for a divorce. He had fallen in love with Nancy Neele, a friend of Major Belcher.[14]: 173–74 On 3 December 1926, the pair quarrelled after Archie announced his plan to spend the weekend with friends, unaccompanied by his wife. Late that evening, Christie disappeared from their home in Sunningdale. The following morning, her car, a Morris Cowley, was discovered at Newlands Corner in Surrey, parked above a chalk quarry with an expired driving licence and clothes inside.[37][38] It was feared that she might have drowned herself in the Silent Pool, a nearby beauty spot.[39]\n\n\nThe disappearance quickly became a news story. The press sought to satisfy their readers' \"hunger for sensation, disaster, and scandal\".[14]: 224 Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks pressured police, and a newspaper offered a £100 reward (equivalent to £7,500 in 2023). More than 1,000 police officers, 15,000 volunteers, and several aeroplanes searched the rural landscape. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle gave a spirit medium one of Christie's gloves to find her.[c] Christie's disappearance made international headlines, including featuring on the front page of *The New York Times*.[41][42] Despite the extensive manhunt, she was not found for another 10 days.[40][43][44] On 14 December 1926, she was located at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel in Harrogate, Yorkshire, 184 miles (296 km) north of her home in Sunningdale, registered as \"Mrs Tressa[d] Neele\" (the surname of her husband's lover) from \"Capetown [*sic*] S.A.\" (South Africa).[46] The next day, Christie left for her sister's residence at Abney Hall, Cheadle, where she was sequestered \"in guarded hall, gates locked, telephone cut off, and callers turned away\".[45][47][48][49]\n\n\nChristie's autobiography makes no reference to the disappearance.[12] Two doctors diagnosed her with \"an unquestionable genuine loss of memory\",[49][50] yet opinion remains divided over the reason for her disappearance. Some, including her biographer Morgan, believe she disappeared during a fugue state.[4]: 154–59[40][51] The author Jared Cade concluded that Christie planned the event to embarrass her husband but did not anticipate the resulting public melodrama.[52]: 121 Christie biographer Laura Thompson provides an alternative view that Christie disappeared during a nervous breakdown, conscious of her actions but not in emotional control of herself.[14]: 220–21 Public reaction at the time was largely negative, supposing a publicity stunt or an attempt to frame her husband for murder.[53][e]\n\n\n\n### Second marriage and later life: 1927–1976[edit]\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a hotel room with Christie memorabilia on the walls](image)Christie's room at the Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul, where the hotel claims she wrote her 1934 novel *Murder on the Orient Express*\nIn January 1927, Christie, looking \"very pale\", sailed with her daughter and secretary to Las Palmas, Canary Islands, to \"complete her convalescence\",[54] returning three months later.[55][f] Christie petitioned for divorce and was granted a decree nisi against her husband in April 1928, which was made absolute in October 1928. Archie married Nancy Neele a week later.[56] Christie retained custody of their daughter, Rosalind, and kept the Christie surname for her writing.[31]: 21[57]\n\n\nReflecting on the period in her autobiography, Christie wrote, \"So, after illness, came sorrow, despair and heartbreak. There is no need to dwell on it.\"[12]: 340\n\n\nIn 1928, Christie left England and took the (Simplon) Orient Express to Istanbul and then to Baghdad.[4]: 169–70 In Iraq, she became friends with archaeologist Leonard Woolley and his wife, who invited her to return to their dig in February 1930.[12]: 376–77 On that second trip, she met archaeologist Max Mallowan, 13 years her junior.[14]: 284 In a 1977 interview, Mallowan recounted his first meeting with Christie, when he took her and a group of tourists on a tour of his expedition site in Iraq.[58] Christie and Mallowan married in Edinburgh in September 1930.[14]: 295–96[59] Their marriage lasted until Christie's death in 1976.[14]: 413–14 She accompanied Mallowan on his archaeological expeditions, and her travels with him contributed background to several of her novels set in the Middle East.[58] Other novels (such as *Peril at End House*) were set in and around Torquay, where she was raised.[30]: 95 Christie drew on her experience of international train travel when writing her 1934 novel *Murder on the Orient Express*.[4]: 201 The Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul, the eastern terminus of the railway, claims the book was written there and maintains Christie's room as a memorial to the author.[60][g]\n\n\n\n![Colour photograph of the front of a three-storey house](image)Cresswell Place, Chelsea\nChristie and Mallowan first lived in Cresswell Place in Chelsea, and later in Sheffield Terrace, Holland Park, Kensington. Both properties are now marked by blue plaques. In 1934, they bought Winterbrook House in Winterbrook, a hamlet near Wallingford.[61] This was their main residence for the rest of their lives and the place where Christie did much of her writing.[14]: 365 This house also bears a blue plaque. Christie led a quiet life despite being known in Wallingford; from 1951 to 1976 she served as president of the local amateur dramatic society.[62]\n\n\nThe couple acquired the Greenway Estate in Devon as a summer residence in 1938;[14]: 310 it was given to the National Trust in 2000.[63] Christie frequently stayed at Abney Hall, Cheshire, which was owned by her brother-in-law, James Watts, and based at least two stories there: a short story, \"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding\", in the story collection of the same name and the novel *After the Funeral*.[12]: 126[14]: 43 One Christie compendium notes that \"Abney became Agatha's greatest inspiration for country-house life, with all its servants and grandeur being woven into her plots. The descriptions of the fictional Chimneys, Stonygates, and other houses in her stories are mostly Abney Hall in various forms.\"[64]\n\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a wall plaque stating Christie \"lived here 1934–1941\"](image)Blue plaque at 58 Sheffield Terrace, Holland Park, London\n![](image)Winterbrook House, Winterbrook, Oxfordshire. Her final home, Christie lived here with her husband from 1934 until her death in 1976.\nDuring World War II, Christie moved to London and lived in a flat at the Isokon in Hampstead, whilst working in the pharmacy at University College Hospital (UCH), London, where she updated her knowledge of poisons.[65] Her later novel *The Pale Horse* was based on a suggestion from Harold Davis, the chief pharmacist at UCH. In 1977, a thallium poisoning case was solved by British medical personnel who had read Christie's book and recognised the symptoms she described.[66][67]\n\n\nThe British intelligence agency MI5 investigated Christie after a character called Major Bletchley appeared in her 1941 thriller *N or M?*, which was about a hunt for a pair of deadly fifth columnists in wartime England.[68] MI5 was concerned that Christie had a spy in Britain's top-secret codebreaking centre, Bletchley Park. The agency's fears were allayed when Christie told her friend, the codebreaker Dilly Knox, \"I was stuck there on my way by train from Oxford to London and took revenge by giving the name to one of my least lovable characters.\"[68]\n\n\nChristie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1950.[31]: 23 In honour of her many literary works, Christie was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours.[69] She was co-president of the Detection Club from 1958 to her death in 1976.[30]: 93 In 1961, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Literature degree by the University of Exeter.[31]: 23 In the 1971 New Year Honours, she was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE),[70][71][72] three years after her husband had been knighted for his archaeological work.[73] After her husband's knighthood, Christie could also be styled Lady Mallowan.[30]: 343\n\n\nFrom 1971 to 1974, Christie's health began to fail, but she continued to write. Her last novel was *Postern of Fate* in 1973.[4]: 368–72[14]: 477 Textual analysis suggested that Christie may have begun to develop Alzheimer's disease or other dementia at about this time.[74][75]\n\n\n\n### Personal qualities[edit]\n\n\n![Black-and-white portrait photograph of Christie in later life](image)Christie at Schiphol Airport, 17 September 1964\nIn 1946, Christie said of herself: \"My chief dislikes are crowds, loud noises, gramophones and cinemas. I dislike the taste of alcohol and do not like smoking. I *do* like sun, sea, flowers, travelling, strange foods, sports, concerts, theatres, pianos, and doing embroidery.\"[76]\n\n\nChristie was a lifelong, \"quietly devout\"[4]: 183 member of the Church of England, attended church regularly, and kept her mother's copy of *The Imitation of Christ* by her bedside.[14]: 30, 290 After her divorce, she stopped taking the sacrament of communion.[14]: 263\n\n\nThe Agatha Christie Trust For Children was established in 1969,[77] and shortly after Christie's death a charitable memorial fund was set up to \"help two causes that she favoured: old people and young children\".[78]\n\n\nChristie's obituary in *The Times* notes that \"she never cared much for the cinema, or for wireless and television.\" Further,\n\n\n\n\n> Dame Agatha's private pleasures were gardening – she won local prizes for horticulture – and buying furniture for her various houses. She was a shy person: she disliked public appearances, but she was friendly and sharp-witted to meet. By inclination as well as breeding, she belonged to the English upper middle class. She wrote about, and for, people like herself. That was an essential part of her charm.[3]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Death and estate[edit]\n\n\n### Death and burial[edit]\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a sandstone headstone](image)Christie's gravestone at St Mary's Church, Cholsey, Oxfordshire\nChristie died peacefully on 12 January 1976 at age 85 from natural causes at her home at Winterbrook House.[79][80] Upon her death, two West End theatres – the St. Martin's, where *The Mousetrap* was playing, and the Savoy, which was home to a revival of *Murder at the Vicarage* – dimmed their outside lights in her honour.[30]: 373 She was buried in the nearby churchyard of St Mary's, Cholsey, in a plot she had chosen with her husband 10 years previously. The simple funeral service was attended by about 20 newspaper and TV reporters, some having travelled from as far away as South America. Thirty wreaths adorned Christie's grave, including one from the cast of her long-running play *The Mousetrap* and one sent \"on behalf of the multitude of grateful readers\" by the Ulverscroft Large Print Book Publishers.[81]\n\n\nMallowan, who remarried in 1977, died in 1978 and was buried next to Christie.[82]\n\n\n\n###  Estate and subsequent ownership of works[edit]\n\n\nChristie was unhappy about becoming \"an employed wage slave\",[14]: 428 and for tax reasons set up a private company in 1955, Agatha Christie Limited, to hold the rights to her works. In about 1959 she transferred her 278-acre home, Greenway Estate, to her daughter, Rosalind Hicks.[83][84] In 1968, when Christie was almost 80, she sold a 51% stake in Agatha Christie Limited (and the works it owned) to Booker Books (better known as Booker Author's Division), which by 1977 had increased its stake to 64%.[4]: 355[85] Agatha Christie Limited still owns the worldwide rights for more than 80 of Christie's novels and short stories, 19 plays, and nearly 40 TV films.[86]\n\n\nIn the late 1950s, Christie had reputedly been earning around £100,000 (approximately equivalent to £3,000,000 in 2023) per year. Christie sold an estimated 300 million books during her lifetime.[87] At the time of her death in 1976, \"she was the best-selling novelist in history.\"[88]\nOne estimate of her total earnings from more than a half-century of writing is $20 million (approximately $107.1 million in 2023).[89] As a result of her tax planning, her will left only £106,683[h] (approximately equivalent to £970,000 in 2023) net, which went mostly to her husband and daughter along with some smaller bequests.[79][91] Her remaining 36% share of Agatha Christie Limited was inherited by Hicks, who passionately preserved her mother's works, image, and legacy until her own death 28 years later.[83] The family's share of the company allowed them to appoint 50% of the board and the chairman, and retain a veto over new treatments, updated versions, and republications of her works.[83][92]\n\n\n\n![](image)Greenway in Devon, Christie's summer home from 1938. The estate was used as a setting for some of her plots, including *Dead Man's Folly*. The final episode of *Agatha Christie's Poirot* was also filmed here in 2013.[93]\nIn 2004, Hicks' obituary in *The Telegraph* noted that she had been \"determined to remain true to her mother's vision and to protect the integrity of her creations\" and disapproved of \"merchandising\" activities.[83] Upon her death on 28 October 2004, the Greenway Estate passed to her son Mathew Prichard. After his stepfather's death in 2005, Prichard donated Greenway and its contents to the National Trust.[83][94]\n\n\nChristie's family and family trusts, including great-grandson James Prichard, continue to own the 36% stake in Agatha Christie Limited,[86] and remain associated with the company. In 2020, James Prichard was the company's chairman.[95] Mathew Prichard also holds the copyright to some of his grandmother's later literary works including *The Mousetrap*.[14]: 427 Christie's work continues to be developed in a range of adaptations.[96]\n\n\nIn 1998, Booker sold its shares in Agatha Christie Limited (at the time earning £2,100,000, approximately equivalent to £4,700,000 in 2023 annual revenue) for £10,000,000 (approximately equivalent to £22,200,000 in 2023) to Chorion, whose portfolio of authors' works included the literary estates of Enid Blyton and Dennis Wheatley.[92] In February 2012, after a management buyout, Chorion began to sell off its literary assets.[86] This included the sale of Chorion's 64% stake in Agatha Christie Limited to Acorn Media UK.[97] In 2014, RLJ Entertainment Inc. (RLJE) acquired Acorn Media UK, renamed it Acorn Media Enterprises, and incorporated it as the RLJE UK development arm.[98]\n\n\nIn late February 2014, media reports stated that the BBC had acquired exclusive TV rights to Christie's works in the UK (previously associated with ITV) and made plans with Acorn's co-operation to air new productions for the 125th anniversary of Christie's birth in 2015.[99] As part of that deal, the BBC broadcast *Partners in Crime*[100] and *And Then There Were None*,[101] both in 2015.[102] Subsequent productions have included *The Witness for the Prosecution*[103] but plans to televise *Ordeal by Innocence* at Christmas 2017 were delayed because of controversy surrounding one of the cast members.[104] The three-part adaptation aired in April 2018.[105] A three-part adaptation of *The A.B.C. Murders* starring John Malkovich and Rupert Grint began filming in June 2018 and was first broadcast in December 2018.[106][107] A two-part adaptation of *The Pale Horse* was broadcast on BBC1 in February 2020.[108] *Death Comes as the End* will be the next BBC adaptation.[109]\n\n\nSince 2020, reissues of Christie's Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot novels by HarperCollins have removed \"passages containing descriptions, insults or references to ethnicity\".[110]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agatha Christie bibliography\n\n### Works of fiction[edit]\n\n\n#### Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple[edit]\n\n\n![Drawing of a gentleman in a dinner suit twirling his large moustache, illustrating the Christie story \"13 for Dinner\"](image)An early depiction of detective Hercule Poirot, from *The American Magazine*, March 1933\nChristie's first published book, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, was released in 1920 and introduced the detective Hercule Poirot, who appeared in 33 of her novels and more than 50 short stories.\n\n\nOver the years, Christie grew tired of Poirot, much as Doyle did with Sherlock Holmes.[4]: 230 By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt he was \"an egocentric creep\".[111] Thompson believes Christie's occasional antipathy to her creation is overstated, and points out that \"in later life she sought to protect him against misrepresentation as powerfully as if he were her own flesh and blood\".[14]: 282 Unlike Doyle, she resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular.[4]: 222 She married off Poirot's \"Watson\", Captain Arthur Hastings, in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.[12]: 268\n\n\nMiss Jane Marple was introduced in a series of short stories that began publication in December 1927 and were subsequently collected under the title *The Thirteen Problems*.[14]: 278 Marple was a genteel, elderly spinster who solved crimes using analogies to English village life.[30]: 47, 74–76 Christie said, \"Miss Marple was not in any way a picture of my grandmother; she was far more fussy and spinsterish than my grandmother ever was\", but her autobiography establishes a firm connection between the fictional character and Christie's step-grandmother Margaret Miller (\"Auntie-Grannie\")[i] and her \"Ealing cronies\".[12]: 422–23[112] Both Marple and Miller \"always expected the worst of everyone and everything, and were, with almost frightening accuracy, usually proved right\".[12]: 422 Marple appeared in 12 novels and 20 stories.\n\n\nDuring the Second World War, Christie wrote two novels, *Curtain* and *Sleeping Murder*, featuring Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, respectively. Both books were sealed in a bank vault, and she made over the copyrights by deed of gift to her daughter and her husband to provide each with a kind of insurance policy.[14]: 344[30]: 190 Christie had a heart attack and a serious fall in 1974, after which she was unable to write.[4]: 372 Her daughter authorised the publication of *Curtain* in 1975,[4]: 375 and *Sleeping Murder* was published posthumously in 1976.[30]: 376 These publications followed the success of the 1974 film version of *Murder on the Orient Express*.[12]: 497[113]\n\n\nShortly before the publication of *Curtain*, Poirot became the first fictional character to have an obituary in *The New York Times*, which was printed on page one on 6 August 1975.[114][115]\n\n\nChristie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple.[30]: 375 In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot – a professional sleuth – would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\"[112]\n\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family supported the release of a new Poirot story, *The Monogram Murders*, written by British author Sophie Hannah.[116] Hannah later published three more Poirot mysteries, *Closed Casket* in 2016, *The Mystery of Three Quarters* in 2018.,[117][118] and *The Killings at Kingfisher Hill* in 2020.\n\n\n\n#### Formula and plot devices[edit]\n\n\nChristie has been called the \"Duchess of Death\", the \"Mistress of Mystery\", and the \"Queen of Crime\".[31]: 15 Early in her career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new.\"[36] According to Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?' Then, slowly, she reveals how the impossible is not only possible but the only thing that could have happened.\"[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAbney Hall, Cheshire, the inspiration for Christie novel settings such as Chimneys and Stonygates\n![](image)\nChristie used inspiration from her stay at the Old Cataract Hotel on the banks of the River Nile in Aswan, Egypt for her 1937 novel *Death on the Nile*\n\nChristie developed her storytelling techniques during what has been called the \"Golden Age\" of detective fiction.[119] Author Dilys Winn called Christie \"the doyenne of Coziness\", a sub-genre which \"featured a small village setting, a hero with faintly aristocratic family connections, a plethora of red herrings and a tendency to commit homicide with sterling silver letter openers and poisons imported from Paraguay\".[120] At the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of their deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party; but there are exceptions where it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as *And Then There Were None* and *Endless Night*).[121][122]\n\n\nChristie did not limit herself to quaint English villages – the action might take place on a small island (*And Then There Were None*), an aeroplane (*Death in the Clouds*), a train (*Murder on the Orient Express*), a steamship (*Death on the Nile*), a smart London flat (*Cards on the Table*), a resort in the West Indies (*A Caribbean Mystery*), or an archaeological dig (*Murder in Mesopotamia*) – but the circle of potential suspects is usually closed and intimate: family members, friends, servants, business associates, fellow travellers.[123]: 37 Stereotyped characters abound (the *femme fatale*, the stolid policeman, the devoted servant, the dull colonel), but these may be subverted to stymie the reader; impersonations and secret alliances are always possible.[123]: 58 There is always a motive – most often, money: \"There are very few killers in Christie who enjoy murder for its own sake.\"[14]: 379, 396\n\n\nProfessor of Pharmacology Michael C. Gerald noted that \"in over half her novels, one or more victims are poisoned, albeit not always to the full satisfaction of the perpetrator.\"[124]: viii Guns, knives, garrottes, tripwires, blunt instruments, and even a hatchet were also used, but \"Christie never resorted to elaborate mechanical or scientific means to explain her ingenuity,\"[125]: 57 according to John Curran, author and literary adviser to the Christie estate.[126] Many of her clues are mundane objects: a calendar, a coffee cup, wax flowers, a beer bottle, a fireplace used during a heat wave.[123]: 38\n\n\nAccording to crime writer P. D. James, Christie was prone to making the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Alert readers could sometimes identify the culprit by identifying the least likely suspect.[127] Christie mocked this insight in her foreword to *Cards on the Table*: \"Spot the person least likely to have committed the crime and in nine times out of ten your task is finished. Since I do not want my faithful readers to fling away this book in disgust, I prefer to warn them beforehand *that this is not that kind of book*.\"[128]: 135–36\n\n\nOn BBC Radio 4's *Desert Island Discs* in 2007, Brian Aldiss said Christie had told him she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to \"frame\" that person.[129] Based upon a study of her working notebooks, Curran describes how Christie would first create a cast of characters, choose a setting, and then produce a list of scenes in which specific clues would be revealed; the order of scenes would be revised as she developed her plot. Of necessity, the murderer had to be known to the author before the sequence could be finalised and she began to type or dictate the first draft of her novel.[123] Much of the work, particularly dialogue, was done in her head before she put it on paper.[12]: 241–45[128]: 33\n\n\nIn 2013, the 600 members of the Crime Writers' Association chose *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* as \"the best whodunit ... ever written\".[130] Author Julian Symons observed, \"In an obvious sense, the book fits within the conventions ... The setting is a village deep within the English countryside, Roger Ackroyd dies in his study; there is a butler who behaves suspiciously ... Every successful detective story in this period involved a deceit practised upon the reader, and here the trick is the highly original one of making the murderer the local doctor, who tells the story and acts as Poirot's Watson.\"[119]: 106–07 Critic Sutherland Scott stated, \"If Agatha Christie had made no other contribution to the literature of detective fiction she would still deserve our grateful thanks\" for writing this novel.[131]\n\n\nIn September 2015, to mark her 125th birthday, *And Then There Were None* was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate.[132] The novel is emblematic of both her use of formula and her willingness to discard it. \"*And Then There Were None* carries the 'closed society' type of murder mystery to extreme lengths,\" according to author Charles Osborne.[30]: 170 It begins with the classic set-up of potential victim(s) and killer(s) isolated from the outside world, but then violates conventions. There is no detective involved in the action, no interviews of suspects, no careful search for clues, and no suspects gathered together in the last chapter to be confronted with the solution. As Christie herself said, \"Ten people had to die without it becoming ridiculous or the murderer being obvious.\"[12]: 457 Critics agreed she had succeeded: \"The arrogant Mrs. Christie this time set herself a fearsome test of her own ingenuity ... the reviews, not surprisingly, were without exception wildly adulatory.\"[30]: 170–71\n\n\n\n#### Character stereotypes and racism[edit]\n\n\nFor information on Christie's book originally titled *Ten Little Niggers*, see And Then There Were None.\n\nChristie included stereotyped descriptions of characters in her work, especially before 1945 (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.[4]: 264–66 For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection *The Mysterious Mr Quin*. In 1947, the Anti-Defamation League in the US sent an official letter of complaint to Christie's American publishers, Dodd, Mead and Company, regarding perceived antisemitism in her works. Christie's British literary agent later wrote to her US representative, authorising American publishers to \"omit the word 'Jew' when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books.\"[14]: 386\n\n\nIn *The Hollow*, published in 1946, one of the characters is described by another as \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a corncrake ... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some \"foreign\" characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (*Hallowe'en Party*) and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in *Three Act Tragedy*), but they are rarely the culprits.[133]\n\n\nIn 2023, the *Telegraph* reported that several Agatha Christie novels have been edited to remove potentially offensive language, including insults and references to ethnicity. Poirot and Miss Marple mysteries written between 1920 and 1976 have had passages reworked or removed in new editions published by HarperCollins, in order to strip them of language and descriptions that modern audiences find offensive, especially those involving the characters Christie’s protagonists encounter outside the UK. Sensitivity readers had made the edits, which were evident in digital versions of the new editions, including the entire Miss Marple run and selected Poirot novels set to be released or that have been released since 2020.[134]\n\n\n\n#### Other detectives[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, Christie also created amateur detectives Thomas (Tommy) Beresford and his wife, Prudence \"Tuppence\" *née* Cowley, who appear in four novels and one collection of short stories published between 1922 and 1974. Unlike her other sleuths, the Beresfords were only in their early twenties when introduced in *The Secret Adversary*, and were allowed to age alongside their creator.[30]: 19–20 She treated their stories with a lighter touch, giving them a \"dash and verve\" which was not universally admired by critics.[31]: 63 Their last adventure, *Postern of Fate*, was Christie's last novel.[14]: 477\n\n\nHarley Quin was \"easily the most unorthodox\" of Christie's fictional detectives.[31]: 70 Inspired by Christie's affection for the figures from the Harlequinade, the semi-supernatural Quin always works with an elderly, conventional man called Satterthwaite. The pair appear in 14 short stories, 12 of which were collected in 1930 as *The Mysterious Mr. Quin*.[30]: 78, 80[135] Mallowan described these tales as \"detection in a fanciful vein, touching on the fairy story, a natural product of Agatha's peculiar imagination\".[30]: 80 Satterthwaite also appears in a novel, *Three Act Tragedy*, and a short story, \"Dead Man's Mirror\", both of which feature Poirot.[30]: 81\n\n\nAnother of her lesser-known characters is Parker Pyne, a retired civil servant who assists unhappy people in an unconventional manner.[30]: 118–19 The 12 short stories which introduced him, *Parker Pyne Investigates* (1934), are best remembered for \"The Case of the Discontented Soldier\", which features Ariadne Oliver, \"an amusing and satirical self-portrait of Agatha Christie\". Over the ensuing decades, Oliver reappeared in seven novels. In most of them she assists Poirot.[30]: 120\n\n\n\n#### Plays[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*The Mousetrap*, the world's longest-running play, showing at the West End's St Martin's Theatre in 2011 with the sign signifying the 59th year of the production\n![](image)\nThe wooden counter in the foyer of St Martin's Theatre showing 22,461 performances of *The Mousetrap* (pictured in November 2006). Attendees often get their photo taken next to it.[136]\n\nIn 1928, Michael Morton adapted *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* for the stage under the name of *Alibi*.[4]: 177 The play enjoyed a respectable run, but Christie disliked the changes made to her work and, in future, preferred to write for the theatre herself. The first of her own stage works was *Black Coffee*, which received good reviews when it opened in the West End in late 1930.[137] She followed this up with adaptations of her detective novels: *And Then There Were None* in 1943, *Appointment with Death* in 1945, and *The Hollow* in 1951.[4]: 242, 251, 288\n\n\nIn the 1950s, \"the theatre ... engaged much of Agatha's attention.\"[138] She next adapted her short radio play into *The Mousetrap*, which premiered in the West End in 1952, produced by Peter Saunders and starring Richard Attenborough as the original Detective Sergeant Trotter.[136] Her expectations for the play were not high; she believed it would run no more than eight months.[12]: 500 *The Mousetrap* has long since made theatrical history as the world's longest-running play, staging its 27,500th performance in September 2018.[136][139][140][141] The play temporarily closed in March 2020, when all UK theatres shut due to the coronavirus pandemic,[142][143] before it re-opened on 17 May 2021.[144]\n\n\nIn 1953, she followed this with *Witness for the Prosecution*, whose Broadway production won the New York Drama Critics' Circle award for best foreign play of 1954 and earned Christie an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America.[4]: 300[125]: 262 *Spider's Web*, an original work written for actress Margaret Lockwood at her request, premiered in the West End in 1954 and was also a hit.[4]: 297, 300 Christie became the first female playwright to have three plays running simultaneously in London: *The Mousetrap*, *Witness for the Prosecution* and *Spider's Web*.[145] She said, \"Plays are much easier to *write* than books, because you can *see* them in your mind's eye, you are not hampered by all that description which clogs you so terribly in a book and stops you from getting on with what's happening.\"[12]: 459 In a letter to her daughter, Christie said being a playwright was \"a lot of fun!\"[14]: 474\n\n\n\n#### As Mary Westmacott[edit]\n\n\nChristie published six mainstream novels under the name Mary Westmacott, a pseudonym which gave her the freedom to explore \"her most private and precious imaginative garden\".[14]: 366–67[30]: 87–88 These books typically received better reviews than her detective and thriller fiction.[14]: 366 Of the first, *Giant's Bread* published in 1930, a reviewer for *The New York Times* wrote, \"... her book is far above the average of current fiction, in fact, comes well under the classification of a 'good book'. And it is only a satisfying novel that can claim that appellation.\"[146] It was publicized from the very beginning that \"Mary Westmacott\" was a pen name of a well-known author, although the identity behind the pen name was kept secret; the dust jacket of *Giant's Bread* mentions that the author had previously written \"under her real name...half a dozen books that have each passed the thirty thousand mark in sales.\" (In fact, though this was technically true, it disguised Christie's identity through understatement. By the publication of *Giant's Bread*, Christie had published 10 novels and two short story collections, all of which had sold considerably more than 30,000 copies.) After Christie's authorship of the first four Westmacott novels was revealed by a journalist in 1949, she wrote two more, the last in 1956.[14]: 366\n\n\nThe other Westmacott titles are: *Unfinished Portrait* (1934), *Absent in the Spring* (1944), *The Rose and the Yew Tree* (1948), *A Daughter's a Daughter* (1952), and *The Burden* (1956).\n\n\n\n### Non-fiction works[edit]\n\n\nChristie published a few non-fiction works. *Come, Tell Me How You Live*, about working on an archaeological dig, was drawn from her life with Mallowan. *The Grand Tour: Around the World with the Queen of Mystery* is a collection of correspondence from her 1922 Grand Tour of the British Empire, including South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. *Agatha Christie: An Autobiography* was published posthumously in 1977 and adjudged the Best Critical/Biographical Work at the 1978 Edgar Awards.[147]\n\n\n\n### Titles[edit]\n\n\nMany of Christie's works from 1940 onward have titles drawn from literature, with the original context of the title typically printed as an epigraph.[148]\n\n\nThe inspirations for some of Christie's titles include:\n\n\n\n* William Shakespeare's works: *Sad Cypress*, *By the Pricking of My Thumbs*, *There is a Tide ...*, *Absent in the Spring*, and *The Mousetrap*, for example. Osborne notes that \"Shakespeare is the writer most quoted in the works of Agatha Christie\";[30]: 164\n* The Bible: *Evil Under the Sun*, *The Burden*, and *The Pale Horse*;\n* Other works of literature: *The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side* (from Tennyson's \"The Lady of Shalott\"), *The Moving Finger* (from Edward FitzGerald's translation of the *Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám*), *The Rose and the Yew Tree* (from T. S. Eliot's *Four Quartets*), *Postern of Fate* (from James Elroy Flecker's \"Gates of Damascus\"), *Endless Night* (from William Blake's \"Auguries of Innocence\"), *N or M?* (from the *Book of Common Prayer*), and *Come, Tell Me How You Live* (from Lewis Carroll's *Through the Looking-Glass*).\n\n\nChristie biographer Gillian Gill said, \"Christie's writing has the sparseness, the directness, the narrative pace, and the universal appeal of the fairy story, and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown-up children that Christie's novels succeed.\"[128]: 208 Reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror, numerous Christie titles were drawn from well-known children's nursery rhymes: *And Then There Were None* (from \"Ten Little Niggers\", a rhyme also published as \"Ten Little Indians\", both of which were also used for the book's title in some printings),[149] *One, Two, Buckle My Shoe* (from \"One, Two, Buckle My Shoe\"), *Five Little Pigs* (from \"This Little Piggy\"), *Crooked House* (from \"There Was a Crooked Man\"), *A Pocket Full of Rye* (from \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\"), *Hickory Dickory Dock* (from \"Hickory Dickory Dock\"), and *Three Blind Mice* (from \"Three Blind Mice\").[128]: 207–08\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a large, book-shaped bronze memorial](image)Memorial to Christie in central London\nChristie is regularly referred to as the \"Queen of Crime\"—which is now trademarked by the Christie estate—or \"Queen of Mystery\", and is considered a master of suspense, plotting, and characterisation.[150][151][152][153] In 1955, she became the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's Grand Master Award.[147] She was named \"Best Writer of the Century\" and the Hercule Poirot series of books was named \"Best Series of the Century\" at the 2000 Bouchercon World Mystery Convention.[154] In 2013, she was voted \"best crime writer\" in a survey of 600 members of the Crime Writers' Association of professional novelists.[130] However, the writer Raymond Chandler criticised the artificiality of her books, as did writer Julian Symons.[155][119]: 100–30 The literary critic Edmund Wilson described her prose as banal and her characterisations as superficial.[156][j]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"With Christie ... we are dealing not so much with a literary figure as with a broad cultural phenomenon, like Barbie or the Beatles.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Joan Acocella writing in *The New Yorker*[159]\n\nIn 2011, Christie was named by the digital crime drama TV channel Alibi as the second most financially successful crime writer of all time in the United Kingdom, after James Bond author Ian Fleming, with total earnings around £100 million.[160] In 2012, Christie was among the people selected by the artist Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous work, the Beatles' *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* album cover, \"to celebrate the British cultural figures he most admires\".[161][162] On the record-breaking longevity of Christie's *The Mousetrap* which had marked its 60th anniversary in 2012, Stephen Moss in *The Guardian* wrote, \"the play and its author are the stars\".[136]\n\n\nIn 2015, marking the 125th anniversary of her birth date, 25 contemporary mystery writers and one publisher gave their views on Christie's works. Many of the authors had read Christie's novels first, before other mystery writers, in English or in their native language, influencing their own writing, and nearly all still viewed her as the \"Queen of Crime\" and creator of the plot twists used by mystery authors. Nearly all had one or more favourites among Christie's mysteries and found her books still good to read nearly 100 years after her first novel was published. Just one of the 25 authors held with Wilson's views.[163]\n\n\n\n### Book sales[edit]\n\n\nIn her prime, Christie was rarely out of the bestseller list.[164] She was the first crime writer to have 100,000 copies of 10 of her titles published by Penguin on the same day in 1948.[165][166] As of 2018[update], *Guinness World Records* listed Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time.[167] As of 2020[update], her novels had sold more than two billion copies in 44 languages.[167] Half the sales are of English-language editions, and half are translations.[168][169] According to Index Translationum, as of 2020[update], she was the most-translated individual author.[170][171]\n\n\nChristie is one of the most-borrowed authors in UK libraries.[172][173][174][175] She is also the UK's best-selling spoken-book author. In 2002, 117,696 Christie audiobooks were sold, in comparison to 97,755 for J. K. Rowling, 78,770 for Roald Dahl and 75,841 for J. R. R. Tolkien.[176][177] In 2015, the Christie estate claimed *And Then There Were None* was \"the best-selling crime novel of all time\",[178] with approximately 100 million sales, also making it one of the highest-selling books of all time.[132][179] More than two million copies of her books were sold in English in 2020.[180]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Commemorative blue plaque in the West End marking *The Mousetrap* as the world's longest-running play\nIn 2016, the Royal Mail marked the centenary of Christie's first detective story by issuing six first-class postage stamps of her works: *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd*, *Murder on the Orient Express*, *And Then There Were None*, *The Body in the Library*, and *A Murder is Announced*. *The Guardian* reported that, \"Each design incorporates microtext, UV ink and thermochromic ink. These concealed clues can be revealed using either a magnifying glass, UV light or body heat and provide pointers to the mysteries' solutions.\"[181][182]\n\n\nHer characters and her face appeared on the stamps of many countries like Dominica and the Somali Republic.[183] In 2020, Christie was commemorated on a £2 coin by the Royal Mint for the first time to mark the centenary of her first novel, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*.[184]\n\n\nIn 2023 a life-size bronze statue of Christie sitting on a park bench holding a book was unveiled in Wallingford.[185]\n\n\n\n### Adaptations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adaptations of Agatha Christie\n\nChristie's works have been adapted for cinema and television. The first was the 1928 British film *The Passing of Mr. Quin*. Poirot's first film appearance was in 1931 in *Alibi*, which starred Austin Trevor as Christie's sleuth.[186]: 14–18 Margaret Rutherford played Marple in a series of films released in the 1960s. Christie liked her acting, but considered the first film \"pretty poor\" and thought no better of the rest.[14]: 430–31\nShe felt differently about the 1974 film *Murder on the Orient Express*, directed by Sidney Lumet, which featured major stars and high production values; her attendance at the London premiere was one of her last public outings.[14]: 476, 482[186]: 57 In 2017, a new film version was released, directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also starred, wearing \"the most extravagant mustache moviegoers have ever seen\".[187] Branagh has since directed two more adaptations of Christie, *Death on the Nile* (2022) and its sequel *A Haunting in Venice* (2023), the latter an adaptation of her 1969 novel *Hallowe'en Party*.[188][189]\n\n\nThe television adaptation *Agatha Christie's Poirot* (1989–2013), with David Suchet in the title role, ran for 70 episodes over 13 series. It received nine BAFTA award nominations and won four BAFTA awards in 1990–1992.[190] The television series *Miss Marple* (1984–1992), with Joan Hickson as \"the BBC's peerless Miss Marple\", adapted all 12 Marple novels.[14]: 500 The French television series *Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie* (2009–2012, 2013–2020), adapted 36 of Christie's stories.[191][192]\n\n\nChristie's books have also been adapted for BBC Radio, a video game series, and graphic novels.[193][194][195][196]\n\n\n\n## Interests and influences[edit]\n\n\n### Pharmacology[edit]\n\n\nDuring the First World War, Christie took a break from nursing to train for the Apothecaries Hall Examination.[124]: xi While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up to date at Torquay Hospital.[12]: 235, 470\n\n\nAs Michael C. Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons ... These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories.\"[124]: viii There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists, and scientists, naïve or suspicious, in Christie's cast of characters; featuring in *Murder in Mesopotamia*, *Cards on the Table*, *The Pale Horse*, and *Mrs. McGinty's Dead*, among many others.[124]\n\n\nGillian Gill notes that the murder method in Christie's first detective novel, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, \"comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary\".[128]: 34 In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don't like messy deaths ... I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"[197] With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under Ronald Knox's \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".[125]: 58 Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, nicotine, thallium, and other substances were used to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades.[124]\n\n\n\n### Archaeology[edit]\n\n\n> \n> The lure of the past came up to grab me. To see a dagger slowly appearing, with its gold glint, through the sand was romantic. The carefulness of lifting pots and objects from the soil filled me with a longing to be an archaeologist myself.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAgatha Christie[12]: 364\n\nIn her youth, Christie showed little interest in antiquities.[14]: 68 After her marriage to Mallowan in 1930, she accompanied him on annual expeditions, spending three to four months at a time in Syria and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, Nineveh, Tell Arpachiyah, Chagar Bazar, Tell Brak, and Nimrud.[14]: 301, 304, 313, 414 The Mallowans also took side trips whilst travelling to and from expedition sites, visiting Italy, Greece, Egypt, Iran, and the Soviet Union, among other places.[4]: 188–91, 199, 212[12]: 429–37 Their experiences travelling and living abroad are reflected in novels such as *Murder on the Orient Express*, *Death on the Nile*, and *Appointment with Death*.[14]: 514 (n. 6)[198]\n\n\nFor the 1931 digging season at Nineveh, Christie bought a writing table to continue her own work; in the early 1950s, she paid to add a small writing room to the team's house at Nimrud.[14]: 301[30]: 244 She also devoted time and effort each season in \"making herself useful by photographing, cleaning, and recording finds; and restoring ceramics, which she especially enjoyed\".[199][31]: 20–21 She also provided funds for the expeditions.[14]: 414\n\n\nMany of the settings for Christie's books were inspired by her archaeological fieldwork in the Middle East; this is reflected in the detail with which she describes them – for instance, the temple of Abu Simbel as depicted in *Death on the Nile* – while the settings for *They Came to Baghdad* were places she and Mallowan had recently stayed.[4]: 212, 283–84 Similarly, she drew upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig throughout *Murder in Mesopotamia*.[123]: 269 Archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts featured in her works include Dr Eric Leidner in *Murder in Mesopotamia* and Signor Richetti in *Death on the Nile*.[200]: 187, 226–27\n\n\nAfter the Second World War, Christie chronicled her time in Syria in *Come, Tell Me How You Live*, which she described as \"small beer – a very little book, full of everyday doings and happenings\".[201]: (Foreword) From 8 November 2001 to March 2002, The British Museum presented a \"colourful and episodic exhibition\" called *Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia* which illustrated how her activities as a writer and as the wife of an archaeologist intertwined.[202]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nSome of Christie's fictional portrayals have explored and offered accounts of her disappearance in 1926. The film *Agatha* (1979), with Vanessa Redgrave, has Christie sneaking away to plan revenge against her husband; Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution.[203] The *Doctor Who* episode \"The Unicorn and the Wasp\" (17 May 2008) stars Fenella Woolgar as Christie, and explains her disappearance as being connected to aliens. The film *Agatha and the Truth of Murder* (2018) sends her undercover to solve the murder of Florence Nightingale's goddaughter, Florence Nightingale Shore. A fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, *Agatha*.[204] *The Christie Affair*, a Christie-like mystery story of love and revenge by author Nina de Gramont, was a 2022 novel loosely based on Christie's disappearance.[205]\n\n\nOther portrayals, such as the Hungarian film *Kojak Budapesten* (1980), create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skills. In the TV play *Murder by the Book* (1986), Christie (Dame Peggy Ashcroft) murders one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's *Dorothy and Agatha* and *The London Blitz Murders* by Max Allan Collins.[206][207] The American television program *Unsolved Mysteries* devoted a segment to her famous disappearance, with Agatha portrayed by actress Tessa Pritchard. A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series *Gran Hotel* (2011) in which she finds inspiration to write her new novel while aiding local detectives. In the alternative history television film *Agatha and the Curse of Ishtar* (2018), Christie becomes involved in a murder case at an archaeological dig in Iraq.[208] In 2019, Honeysuckle Weeks portrayed Christie in an episode, \"No Friends Like Old Friends\", in a Canadian drama, *Frankie Drake Mysteries.*\n\n\nIn 2020, Heather Terrell, under the pseudonym of Marie Benedict, published *The Mystery of Mrs. Christie*, a fictional reconstruction of Christie's December 1926 disappearance. The novel was on the *USA Today* and *The New York Times* Best Seller lists.[209][210] In December 2020, Library Reads named Terrell a Hall of Fame author for the book.[211]\nAndrew Wilson has written four novels featuring Agatha Christie as a detective: *A Talent For Murder* (2017), *A Different Kind of Evil* (2018), *Death In A Desert Land* (2019) and *I Saw Him Die* (2020).[212] Christie was portrayed by Shirley Henderson in the 2022 comedy/mystery film *See How They Run*.[213][214]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Agatha Christie indult (an oecumenical request to which Christie was signatory seeking permission for the occasional use of the Tridentine (Latin) mass in England and Wales)\n* Agatha Awards (literary awards for mystery and crime writers)\n* Agatha Christie Award (Japan) (literary award for unpublished mystery novels)\n* List of solved missing person cases\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Most biographers give Christie's mother's place of birth as Belfast but do not provide sources. Current primary evidence, including census entries (place of birth Dublin), her baptism record (Dublin), and her father's service record and regimental history (when her father was in Dublin), indicates she was almost certainly born in Dublin in the first quarter of 1854.[8][9][10]\n2. **^** Boehmer's death registration states he died at age 49 from bronchitis after retiring from the army,[11] but Christie and her biographers have consistently claimed he was killed in a riding accident while still a serving officer.[12]: 5[13][4]: 2[14]: 9–10\n3. **^** Dorothy L. Sayers, who visited the \"scene of the disappearance\", later incorporated details in her book *Unnatural Death*.[40]\n4. **^** The notice placed by Christie in *The Times* (11 December 1926, p.1) gives the first name as Teresa, but her hotel register signature more naturally reads Tressa; newspapers reported that Christie used Tressa on other occasions during her disappearance (including joining a library).[45]\n5. **^** Christie hinted at a nervous breakdown, saying to a woman with similar symptoms, \"I think you had better be very careful; it is probably the beginning of a nervous breakdown.\"[12]: 337\n6. **^** Christie's authorised biographer includes an account of specialist psychiatric treatment following Christie's disappearance, but the information was obtained second or third hand after her death.[4]: 148–49, 159\n7. **^** Other authors claim Christie wrote *Murder on the Orient Express* whilst at a dig at Arpachiyah.[4]: 206[30]: 111\n8. **^** According to other sources, her estate was valued at £147 810.[90]\n9. **^** Christie's familial relationship to Margaret Miller (née West) was complex. As well as being Christie's maternal great-aunt, Miller was Christie's father's step-mother as well as Christie's mother's foster mother and step-mother-in-law – hence the appellation \"Auntie-Grannie\".\n10. **^** Wilson's 1945 essay, \"Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?\" was dismissive of the detective fiction genre in general but did not mention Christie by name.[157][158]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Most translated author\". *Guinness World Records*. 7 March 2017.\n2. **^** \"Result of world's favourite Christie global vote\". *Agatha Christie*. 22 December 2015.

She also wrote the world's longest-running play, the murder mystery *The Mousetrap*, which has been performed in the West End since 1952. A writer during the \"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\", Christie has been called the \"Queen of Crime\". She also wrote six novels under the pseudonym **Mary Westmacott**. In 1971, she was made a Dame (DBE) by Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions to literature. *Guinness World Records* lists Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time, her novels having sold more than two billion copies.\n\n\nChristie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon, and was largely home-schooled. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed in 1920 when *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, featuring detective Hercule Poirot, was published. Her first husband was Archibald Christie; they married in 1914 and had one child before divorcing in 1928. Following the breakdown of her marriage and the death of her mother in 1926 she made international headlines by going missing for eleven days. During both World Wars, she served in hospital dispensaries, acquiring a thorough knowledge of the poisons that featured in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. Following her marriage to archaeologist Max Mallowan in 1930, she spent several months each year on digs in the Middle East and used her first-hand knowledge of this profession in her fiction.\n\n\nAccording to UNESCO's Index Translationum, she remains the most-translated individual author.[1] Her novel *And Then There Were None* is one of the top-selling books of all time, with approximately 100 million copies sold. Christie's stage play *The Mousetrap* holds the world record for the longest initial run. It opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in the West End on 25 November 1952, and by 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances. The play was temporarily closed in 2020 because of COVID-19 lockdowns in London before it reopened in 2021.\n\n\nIn 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's Grand Master Award. Later that year, *Witness for the Prosecution* received an Edgar Award for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best crime writer and *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists of the Crime Writers' Association. In 2015, *And Then There Were None* was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate.[2] Many of Christie's books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and graphic novels. More than 30 feature films are based on her work.\n\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and adolescence: 1890–1907[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Christie entitled *Lost in Reverie*, by Douglas John Connah, 1894\nAgatha Mary Clarissa Miller was born on 15 September 1890, into a wealthy upper middle class family in Torquay, Devon. She was the youngest of three children born to Frederick Alvah Miller, \"a gentleman of substance\",[3] and his wife Clarissa Margaret \"Clara\" Miller, née Boehmer.[4]: 1–4[5][6][7]\n\n\nChristie's mother Clara was born in Dublin in 1854[a] to British Army officer Frederick Boehmer[10] and his wife Mary Ann Boehmer (née West). Boehmer died in Jersey in 1863,[b] leaving his widow to raise Clara and her brothers on a meagre income.[11][14]: 10 Two weeks after Boehmer's death, Mary's sister Margaret West married widowed dry goods merchant Nathaniel Frary Miller, a US citizen.[15] To assist Mary financially, they agreed to foster nine-year-old Clara; the family settled in Timperley, Cheshire.[16] Margaret and Nathaniel had no children together, but Nathaniel had a 17-year-old son, Fred Miller, from his previous marriage. Fred was born in New York City and travelled extensively after leaving his Swiss boarding school.[14]: 12 He and Clara were married in London in 1878.[4]: 2–5[5] Their first child, Margaret Frary (\"Madge\"), was born in Torquay in 1879.[4]: 6[17] The second, Louis Montant (\"Monty\"), was born in Morristown, New Jersey, in 1880,[18] while the family was on an extended visit to the United States.[12]: 7\n\n\nWhen Fred's father died in 1869,[19] he left Clara £2,000 (approximately equivalent to £230,000 in 2023); in 1881 they used this to buy the leasehold of a villa in Torquay named Ashfield.[20][21] It was here that their third and last child, Agatha, was born in 1890.[4]: 6–7[7] She described her childhood as \"very happy\".[12]: 3 The Millers lived mainly in Devon but often visited her step-grandmother/great-aunt Margaret Miller in Ealing and maternal grandmother Mary Boehmer in Bayswater.[12]: 26–31 A year was spent abroad with her family, in the French Pyrenees, Paris, Dinard, and Guernsey.[4]: 15, 24–25 Because her siblings were so much older, and there were few children in their neighbourhood, Christie spent much of her time playing alone with her pets and imaginary companions.[12]: 9–10, 86–88 She eventually made friends with other girls in Torquay, noting that \"one of the highlights of my existence\" was her appearance with them in a youth production of Gilbert and Sullivan's *The Yeomen of the Guard*, in which she played the hero, Colonel Fairfax.[4]: 23–27\n\n\n\n![Black-and-white portrait photograph of Christie as a girl](image)Christie as a girl, early 1900s\nAccording to Christie, Clara believed she should not learn to read until she was eight; thanks to her curiosity, she was reading by the age of four.[12]: 13 Her sister had been sent to a boarding school, but their mother insisted that Christie receive her education at home. As a result, her parents and sister supervised her studies in reading, writing and basic arithmetic, a subject she particularly enjoyed. They also taught her music, and she learned to play the piano and the mandolin.[4]: 8, 20–21\n\n\nChristie was a voracious reader from an early age. Among her earliest memories were of reading children's books by Mrs Molesworth and Edith Nesbit. When a little older, she moved on to the surreal verse of Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll.[4]: 18–19 As an adolescent, she enjoyed works by Anthony Hope, Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, and Alexandre Dumas.[12]: 111, 136–37 In April 1901, aged 10, she wrote her first poem, \"The Cow Slip\".[22]\n\n\nBy 1901, her father's health had deteriorated, because of what he believed were heart problems.[14]: 33 Fred died in November 1901 from pneumonia and chronic kidney disease.[23] Christie later said that her father's death when she was 11 marked the end of her childhood.[4]: 32–33\n\n\nThe family's financial situation had, by this time, worsened. Madge married the year after their father's death and moved to Cheadle, Cheshire; Monty was overseas, serving in a British regiment.[14]: 43, 49 Christie now lived alone at Ashfield with her mother. In 1902, she began attending Miss Guyer's Girls' School in Torquay but found it difficult to adjust to the disciplined atmosphere.[12]: 139 In 1905, her mother sent her to Paris, where she was educated in a series of *pensionnats* (boarding schools), focusing on voice training and piano playing. Deciding she lacked the temperament and talent, she gave up her goal of performing professionally as a concert pianist or an opera singer.[14]: 59–61\n\n\n\n### Early literary attempts, marriage, literary success: 1907–1926[edit]\n\n\nAfter completing her education, Christie returned to England to find her mother ailing. They decided to spend the northern winter of 1907–1908 in the warm climate of Egypt, which was then a regular tourist destination for wealthy Britons.[12]: 155–57 They stayed for three months at the Gezirah Palace Hotel in Cairo. Christie attended many dances and other social functions; she particularly enjoyed watching amateur polo matches. While they visited some ancient Egyptian monuments such as the Great Pyramid of Giza, she did not exhibit the great interest in archaeology and Egyptology that developed in her later years.[4]: 40–41 Returning to Britain, she continued her social activities, writing and performing in amateur theatrics. She also helped put on a play called *The Blue Beard of Unhappiness* with female friends.[4]: 45–47\n\n\nAt 18, Christie wrote her first short story, \"The House of Beauty\", while recovering in bed from an illness. It consisted of about 6,000 words about \"madness and dreams\", subjects of fascination for her. Her biographer Janet Morgan has commented that, despite \"infelicities of style\", the story was \"compelling\".[4]: 48–49 (The story became an early version of her story \"The House of Dreams\".)[24] Other stories followed, most of them illustrating her interest in spiritualism and the paranormal. These included \"The Call of Wings\" and \"The Little Lonely God\". Magazines rejected all her early submissions, made under pseudonyms (including Mac Miller, Nathaniel Miller, and Sydney West); some submissions were later revised and published under her real name, often with new titles.[4]: 49–50\n\n\n\n![](image)Christie as a young woman, 1910s\nAround the same time, Christie began work on her first novel, *Snow Upon the Desert*. Writing under the pseudonym Monosyllaba, she set the book in Cairo and drew upon her recent experiences there. She was disappointed when the six publishers she contacted declined the work.[4]: 50–51[25] Clara suggested that her daughter ask for advice from the successful novelist Eden Phillpotts, a family friend and neighbour, who responded to her enquiry, encouraged her writing, and sent her an introduction to his own literary agent, Hughes Massie, who also rejected *Snow Upon the Desert* but suggested a second novel.[4]: 51–52\n\n\nMeanwhile, Christie's social activities expanded, with country house parties, riding, hunting, dances, and roller skating.[12]: 165–66 She had short-lived relationships with four men and an engagement to another.[14]: 64–67 In October 1912, she was introduced to Archibald \"Archie\" Christie at a dance given by Lord and Lady Clifford at Ugbrooke, about 12 miles (19 km) from Torquay. The son of a barrister in the Indian Civil Service, Archie was a Royal Artillery officer who was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps in April 1913.[26] The couple quickly fell in love. Three months after their first meeting, Archie proposed marriage, and Agatha accepted.[4]: 54–63\n\n\n\n![](image)Christie as a nurse in the Voluntary Aid Detachment of the British Red Cross. She is pictured in 1915 outside her childhood home of Ashfield.\nWith the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Archie was sent to France to fight. They married on Christmas Eve 1914 at Emmanuel Church, Clifton, Bristol, close to the home of his mother and stepfather, when Archie was on home leave.[27][28] Rising through the ranks, he was posted back to Britain in September 1918 as a colonel in the Air Ministry. Christie involved herself in the war effort as a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment of the British Red Cross. From October 1914 to May 1915, then from June 1916 to September 1918, she worked 3,400 hours in the Town Hall Red Cross Hospital, Torquay, first as a nurse (unpaid) then as a dispenser at £16 (approximately equivalent to £1,130 in 2023) a year from 1917 after qualifying as an apothecary's assistant.[4]: 69[29] Her war service ended in September 1918 when Archie was reassigned to London, and they rented a flat in St. John's Wood.[4]: 73–74\n\n\nChristie had long been a fan of detective novels, having enjoyed Wilkie Collins's *The Woman in White* and *The Moonstone*, and Arthur Conan Doyle's early Sherlock Holmes stories. She wrote her first detective novel, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, in 1916. It featured Hercule Poirot, a former Belgian police officer with \"magnificent moustaches\" and a head \"exactly the shape of an egg\",[30]: 13 who had taken refuge in Britain after Germany invaded Belgium. Christie's inspiration for the character came from Belgian refugees living in Torquay, and the Belgian soldiers she helped to treat as a volunteer nurse during the First World War.[4]: 75–79[31]: 17–18 Her original manuscript was rejected by Hodder & Stoughton and Methuen. After keeping the submission for several months, John Lane at The Bodley Head offered to accept it, provided that Christie change how the solution was revealed. She did so, and signed a contract committing her next five books to The Bodley Head, which she later felt was exploitative.[4]: 79, 81–82 It was published in 1920.[22]\n\n\n\n![Black-and-white photograph of three men in suits and one woman seated in a room and looking at an open newspaper](image)Archie Christie, Major Belcher (tour leader), Mr. Bates (secretary) and Agatha Christie on the 1922 British Empire Expedition Tour\nChristie settled into married life, giving birth to her only child, Rosalind Margaret Clarissa (later Hicks), in August 1919 at Ashfield.[4]: 79[14]: 340, 349, 422 Archie left the Air Force at the end of the war and began working in the City financial sector on a relatively low salary. They still employed a maid.[4]: 80–81 Her second novel, *The Secret Adversary* (1922), featured a new detective couple Tommy and Tuppence, again published by The Bodley Head. It earned her £50 (approximately equivalent to £3,400 in 2023). A third novel, *Murder on the Links*, again featured Poirot, as did the short stories commissioned by Bruce Ingram, editor of *The Sketch* magazine, from 1923.[4]: 83 She now had no difficulty selling her work.[30]: 33\n\n\nIn 1922, the Christies joined an around-the-world promotional tour for the British Empire Exhibition, led by Major Ernest Belcher. Leaving their daughter with Agatha's mother and sister, in 10 months they travelled to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Canada.[4]: 86–103[32] They learned to surf prone in South Africa; then, in Waikiki, they were among the first Britons to surf standing up, and extended their time there by three months to practise.[33][34] She is remembered at the British Surfing Museum as having said about surfing, \"*Oh it was heaven! Nothing like rushing through the water at what seems to you a speed of about two hundred miles an hour. It is one of the most perfect physical pleasures I have known*.\"[35]\n\n\nWhen they returned to England, Archie resumed work in the city, and Christie continued to work hard at her writing. After living in a series of apartments in London, they bought a house in Sunningdale, Berkshire, which they renamed Styles after the mansion in Christie's first detective novel.[4]: 124–25[14]: 154–55\n\n\nChristie's mother, Clarissa Miller, died in April 1926. They had been exceptionally close, and the loss sent Christie into a deep depression.[14]: 168–72 In August 1926, reports appeared in the press that Christie had gone to a village near Biarritz to recuperate from a \"breakdown\" caused by \"overwork\".[36]\n\n\n\n### Disappearance: 1926[edit]\n\n\n![Newspaper article with portraits of Agatha and Archie Christie](image)*Daily Herald*, 15 December 1926, announcing that Christie had been found. Missing for 11 days, she was found at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel in Harrogate, Yorkshire\nIn August 1926, Archie asked Agatha for a divorce. He had fallen in love with Nancy Neele, a friend of Major Belcher.[14]: 173–74 On 3 December 1926, the pair quarrelled after Archie announced his plan to spend the weekend with friends, unaccompanied by his wife. Late that evening, Christie disappeared from their home in Sunningdale. The following morning, her car, a Morris Cowley, was discovered at Newlands Corner in Surrey, parked above a chalk quarry with an expired driving licence and clothes inside.[37][38] It was feared that she might have drowned herself in the Silent Pool, a nearby beauty spot.[39]\n\n\nThe disappearance quickly became a news story. The press sought to satisfy their readers' \"hunger for sensation, disaster, and scandal\".[14]: 224 Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks pressured police, and a newspaper offered a £100 reward (equivalent to £7,500 in 2023). More than 1,000 police officers, 15,000 volunteers, and several aeroplanes searched the rural landscape. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle gave a spirit medium one of Christie's gloves to find her.[c] Christie's disappearance made international headlines, including featuring on the front page of *The New York Times*.[41][42] Despite the extensive manhunt, she was not found for another 10 days.[40][43][44] On 14 December 1926, she was located at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel in Harrogate, Yorkshire, 184 miles (296 km) north of her home in Sunningdale, registered as \"Mrs Tressa[d] Neele\" (the surname of her husband's lover) from \"Capetown [*sic*] S.A.\" (South Africa).[46] The next day, Christie left for her sister's residence at Abney Hall, Cheadle, where she was sequestered \"in guarded hall, gates locked, telephone cut off, and callers turned away\".[45][47][48][49]\n\n\nChristie's autobiography makes no reference to the disappearance.[12] Two doctors diagnosed her with \"an unquestionable genuine loss of memory\",[49][50] yet opinion remains divided over the reason for her disappearance. Some, including her biographer Morgan, believe she disappeared during a fugue state.[4]: 154–59[40][51] The author Jared Cade concluded that Christie planned the event to embarrass her husband but did not anticipate the resulting public melodrama.[52]: 121 Christie biographer Laura Thompson provides an alternative view that Christie disappeared during a nervous breakdown, conscious of her actions but not in emotional control of herself.[14]: 220–21 Public reaction at the time was largely negative, supposing a publicity stunt or an attempt to frame her husband for murder.[53][e]\n\n\n\n### Second marriage and later life: 1927–1976[edit]\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a hotel room with Christie memorabilia on the walls](image)Christie's room at the Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul, where the hotel claims she wrote her 1934 novel *Murder on the Orient Express*\nIn January 1927, Christie, looking \"very pale\", sailed with her daughter and secretary to Las Palmas, Canary Islands, to \"complete her convalescence\",[54] returning three months later.[55][f] Christie petitioned for divorce and was granted a decree nisi against her husband in April 1928, which was made absolute in October 1928. Archie married Nancy Neele a week later.[56] Christie retained custody of their daughter, Rosalind, and kept the Christie surname for her writing.[31]: 21[57]\n\n\nReflecting on the period in her autobiography, Christie wrote, \"So, after illness, came sorrow, despair and heartbreak. There is no need to dwell on it.\"[12]: 340\n\n\nIn 1928, Christie left England and took the (Simplon) Orient Express to Istanbul and then to Baghdad.[4]: 169–70 In Iraq, she became friends with archaeologist Leonard Woolley and his wife, who invited her to return to their dig in February 1930.[12]: 376–77 On that second trip, she met archaeologist Max Mallowan, 13 years her junior.[14]: 284 In a 1977 interview, Mallowan recounted his first meeting with Christie, when he took her and a group of tourists on a tour of his expedition site in Iraq.[58] Christie and Mallowan married in Edinburgh in September 1930.[14]: 295–96[59] Their marriage lasted until Christie's death in 1976.[14]: 413–14 She accompanied Mallowan on his archaeological expeditions, and her travels with him contributed background to several of her novels set in the Middle East.[58] Other novels (such as *Peril at End House*) were set in and around Torquay, where she was raised.[30]: 95 Christie drew on her experience of international train travel when writing her 1934 novel *Murder on the Orient Express*.[4]: 201 The Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul, the eastern terminus of the railway, claims the book was written there and maintains Christie's room as a memorial to the author.[60][g]\n\n\n\n![Colour photograph of the front of a three-storey house](image)Cresswell Place, Chelsea\nChristie and Mallowan first lived in Cresswell Place in Chelsea, and later in Sheffield Terrace, Holland Park, Kensington. Both properties are now marked by blue plaques. In 1934, they bought Winterbrook House in Winterbrook, a hamlet near Wallingford.[61] This was their main residence for the rest of their lives and the place where Christie did much of her writing.[14]: 365 This house also bears a blue plaque. Christie led a quiet life despite being known in Wallingford; from 1951 to 1976 she served as president of the local amateur dramatic society.[62]\n\n\nThe couple acquired the Greenway Estate in Devon as a summer residence in 1938;[14]: 310 it was given to the National Trust in 2000.[63] Christie frequently stayed at Abney Hall, Cheshire, which was owned by her brother-in-law, James Watts, and based at least two stories there: a short story, \"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding\", in the story collection of the same name and the novel *After the Funeral*.[12]: 126[14]: 43 One Christie compendium notes that \"Abney became Agatha's greatest inspiration for country-house life, with all its servants and grandeur being woven into her plots. The descriptions of the fictional Chimneys, Stonygates, and other houses in her stories are mostly Abney Hall in various forms.\"[64]\n\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a wall plaque stating Christie \"lived here 1934–1941\"](image)Blue plaque at 58 Sheffield Terrace, Holland Park, London\n![](image)Winterbrook House, Winterbrook, Oxfordshire. Her final home, Christie lived here with her husband from 1934 until her death in 1976.\nDuring World War II, Christie moved to London and lived in a flat at the Isokon in Hampstead, whilst working in the pharmacy at University College Hospital (UCH), London, where she updated her knowledge of poisons.[65] Her later novel *The Pale Horse* was based on a suggestion from Harold Davis, the chief pharmacist at UCH. In 1977, a thallium poisoning case was solved by British medical personnel who had read Christie's book and recognised the symptoms she described.[66][67]\n\n\nThe British intelligence agency MI5 investigated Christie after a character called Major Bletchley appeared in her 1941 thriller *N or M?*, which was about a hunt for a pair of deadly fifth columnists in wartime England.[68] MI5 was concerned that Christie had a spy in Britain's top-secret codebreaking centre, Bletchley Park. The agency's fears were allayed when Christie told her friend, the codebreaker Dilly Knox, \"I was stuck there on my way by train from Oxford to London and took revenge by giving the name to one of my least lovable characters.\"[68]\n\n\nChristie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1950.[31]: 23 In honour of her many literary works, Christie was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours.[69] She was co-president of the Detection Club from 1958 to her death in 1976.[30]: 93 In 1961, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Literature degree by the University of Exeter.[31]: 23 In the 1971 New Year Honours, she was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE),[70][71][72] three years after her husband had been knighted for his archaeological work.[73] After her husband's knighthood, Christie could also be styled Lady Mallowan.[30]: 343\n\n\nFrom 1971 to 1974, Christie's health began to fail, but she continued to write. Her last novel was *Postern of Fate* in 1973.[4]: 368–72[14]: 477 Textual analysis suggested that Christie may have begun to develop Alzheimer's disease or other dementia at about this time.[74][75]\n\n\n\n### Personal qualities[edit]\n\n\n![Black-and-white portrait photograph of Christie in later life](image)Christie at Schiphol Airport, 17 September 1964\nIn 1946, Christie said of herself: \"My chief dislikes are crowds, loud noises, gramophones and cinemas. I dislike the taste of alcohol and do not like smoking. I *do* like sun, sea, flowers, travelling, strange foods, sports, concerts, theatres, pianos, and doing embroidery.\"[76]\n\n\nChristie was a lifelong, \"quietly devout\"[4]: 183 member of the Church of England, attended church regularly, and kept her mother's copy of *The Imitation of Christ* by her bedside.[14]: 30, 290 After her divorce, she stopped taking the sacrament of communion.[14]: 263\n\n\nThe Agatha Christie Trust For Children was established in 1969,[77] and shortly after Christie's death a charitable memorial fund was set up to \"help two causes that she favoured: old people and young children\".[78]\n\n\nChristie's obituary in *The Times* notes that \"she never cared much for the cinema, or for wireless and television.\" Further,\n\n\n\n\n> Dame Agatha's private pleasures were gardening – she won local prizes for horticulture – and buying furniture for her various houses. She was a shy person: she disliked public appearances, but she was friendly and sharp-witted to meet. By inclination as well as breeding, she belonged to the English upper middle class. She wrote about, and for, people like herself. That was an essential part of her charm.[3]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Death and estate[edit]\n\n\n### Death and burial[edit]\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a sandstone headstone](image)Christie's gravestone at St Mary's Church, Cholsey, Oxfordshire\nChristie died peacefully on 12 January 1976 at age 85 from natural causes at her home at Winterbrook House.[79][80] Upon her death, two West End theatres – the St. Martin's, where *The Mousetrap* was playing, and the Savoy, which was home to a revival of *Murder at the Vicarage* – dimmed their outside lights in her honour.[30]: 373 She was buried in the nearby churchyard of St Mary's, Cholsey, in a plot she had chosen with her husband 10 years previously. The simple funeral service was attended by about 20 newspaper and TV reporters, some having travelled from as far away as South America. Thirty wreaths adorned Christie's grave, including one from the cast of her long-running play *The Mousetrap* and one sent \"on behalf of the multitude of grateful readers\" by the Ulverscroft Large Print Book Publishers.[81]\n\n\nMallowan, who remarried in 1977, died in 1978 and was buried next to Christie.[82]\n\n\n\n###  Estate and subsequent ownership of works[edit]\n\n\nChristie was unhappy about becoming \"an employed wage slave\",[14]: 428 and for tax reasons set up a private company in 1955, Agatha Christie Limited, to hold the rights to her works. In about 1959 she transferred her 278-acre home, Greenway Estate, to her daughter, Rosalind Hicks.[83][84] In 1968, when Christie was almost 80, she sold a 51% stake in Agatha Christie Limited (and the works it owned) to Booker Books (better known as Booker Author's Division), which by 1977 had increased its stake to 64%.[4]: 355[85] Agatha Christie Limited still owns the worldwide rights for more than 80 of Christie's novels and short stories, 19 plays, and nearly 40 TV films.[86]\n\n\nIn the late 1950s, Christie had reputedly been earning around £100,000 (approximately equivalent to £3,000,000 in 2023) per year. Christie sold an estimated 300 million books during her lifetime.[87] At the time of her death in 1976, \"she was the best-selling novelist in history.\"[88]\nOne estimate of her total earnings from more than a half-century of writing is $20 million (approximately $107.1 million in 2023).[89] As a result of her tax planning, her will left only £106,683[h] (approximately equivalent to £970,000 in 2023) net, which went mostly to her husband and daughter along with some smaller bequests.[79][91] Her remaining 36% share of Agatha Christie Limited was inherited by Hicks, who passionately preserved her mother's works, image, and legacy until her own death 28 years later.[83] The family's share of the company allowed them to appoint 50% of the board and the chairman, and retain a veto over new treatments, updated versions, and republications of her works.[83][92]\n\n\n\n![](image)Greenway in Devon, Christie's summer home from 1938. The estate was used as a setting for some of her plots, including *Dead Man's Folly*. The final episode of *Agatha Christie's Poirot* was also filmed here in 2013.[93]\nIn 2004, Hicks' obituary in *The Telegraph* noted that she had been \"determined to remain true to her mother's vision and to protect the integrity of her creations\" and disapproved of \"merchandising\" activities.[83] Upon her death on 28 October 2004, the Greenway Estate passed to her son Mathew Prichard. After his stepfather's death in 2005, Prichard donated Greenway and its contents to the National Trust.[83][94]\n\n\nChristie's family and family trusts, including great-grandson James Prichard, continue to own the 36% stake in Agatha Christie Limited,[86] and remain associated with the company. In 2020, James Prichard was the company's chairman.[95] Mathew Prichard also holds the copyright to some of his grandmother's later literary works including *The Mousetrap*.[14]: 427 Christie's work continues to be developed in a range of adaptations.[96]\n\n\nIn 1998, Booker sold its shares in Agatha Christie Limited (at the time earning £2,100,000, approximately equivalent to £4,700,000 in 2023 annual revenue) for £10,000,000 (approximately equivalent to £22,200,000 in 2023) to Chorion, whose portfolio of authors' works included the literary estates of Enid Blyton and Dennis Wheatley.[92] In February 2012, after a management buyout, Chorion began to sell off its literary assets.[86] This included the sale of Chorion's 64% stake in Agatha Christie Limited to Acorn Media UK.[97] In 2014, RLJ Entertainment Inc. (RLJE) acquired Acorn Media UK, renamed it Acorn Media Enterprises, and incorporated it as the RLJE UK development arm.[98]\n\n\nIn late February 2014, media reports stated that the BBC had acquired exclusive TV rights to Christie's works in the UK (previously associated with ITV) and made plans with Acorn's co-operation to air new productions for the 125th anniversary of Christie's birth in 2015.[99] As part of that deal, the BBC broadcast *Partners in Crime*[100] and *And Then There Were None*,[101] both in 2015.[102] Subsequent productions have included *The Witness for the Prosecution*[103] but plans to televise *Ordeal by Innocence* at Christmas 2017 were delayed because of controversy surrounding one of the cast members.[104] The three-part adaptation aired in April 2018.[105] A three-part adaptation of *The A.B.C. Murders* starring John Malkovich and Rupert Grint began filming in June 2018 and was first broadcast in December 2018.[106][107] A two-part adaptation of *The Pale Horse* was broadcast on BBC1 in February 2020.[108] *Death Comes as the End* will be the next BBC adaptation.[109]\n\n\nSince 2020, reissues of Christie's Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot novels by HarperCollins have removed \"passages containing descriptions, insults or references to ethnicity\".[110]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agatha Christie bibliography\n\n### Works of fiction[edit]\n\n\n#### Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple[edit]\n\n\n![Drawing of a gentleman in a dinner suit twirling his large moustache, illustrating the Christie story \"13 for Dinner\"](image)An early depiction of detective Hercule Poirot, from *The American Magazine*, March 1933\nChristie's first published book, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, was released in 1920 and introduced the detective Hercule Poirot, who appeared in 33 of her novels and more than 50 short stories.\n\n\nOver the years, Christie grew tired of Poirot, much as Doyle did with Sherlock Holmes.[4]: 230 By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt he was \"an egocentric creep\".[111] Thompson believes Christie's occasional antipathy to her creation is overstated, and points out that \"in later life she sought to protect him against misrepresentation as powerfully as if he were her own flesh and blood\".[14]: 282 Unlike Doyle, she resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular.[4]: 222 She married off Poirot's \"Watson\", Captain Arthur Hastings, in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.[12]: 268\n\n\nMiss Jane Marple was introduced in a series of short stories that began publication in December 1927 and were subsequently collected under the title *The Thirteen Problems*.[14]: 278 Marple was a genteel, elderly spinster who solved crimes using analogies to English village life.[30]: 47, 74–76 Christie said, \"Miss Marple was not in any way a picture of my grandmother; she was far more fussy and spinsterish than my grandmother ever was\", but her autobiography establishes a firm connection between the fictional character and Christie's step-grandmother Margaret Miller (\"Auntie-Grannie\")[i] and her \"Ealing cronies\".[12]: 422–23[112] Both Marple and Miller \"always expected the worst of everyone and everything, and were, with almost frightening accuracy, usually proved right\".[12]: 422 Marple appeared in 12 novels and 20 stories.\n\n\nDuring the Second World War, Christie wrote two novels, *Curtain* and *Sleeping Murder*, featuring Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, respectively. Both books were sealed in a bank vault, and she made over the copyrights by deed of gift to her daughter and her husband to provide each with a kind of insurance policy.[14]: 344[30]: 190 Christie had a heart attack and a serious fall in 1974, after which she was unable to write.[4]: 372 Her daughter authorised the publication of *Curtain* in 1975,[4]: 375 and *Sleeping Murder* was published posthumously in 1976.[30]: 376 These publications followed the success of the 1974 film version of *Murder on the Orient Express*.[12]: 497[113]\n\n\nShortly before the publication of *Curtain*, Poirot became the first fictional character to have an obituary in *The New York Times*, which was printed on page one on 6 August 1975.[114][115]\n\n\nChristie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple.[30]: 375 In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot – a professional sleuth – would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\"[112]\n\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family supported the release of a new Poirot story, *The Monogram Murders*, written by British author Sophie Hannah.[116] Hannah later published three more Poirot mysteries, *Closed Casket* in 2016, *The Mystery of Three Quarters* in 2018.,[117][118] and *The Killings at Kingfisher Hill* in 2020.\n\n\n\n#### Formula and plot devices[edit]\n\n\nChristie has been called the \"Duchess of Death\", the \"Mistress of Mystery\", and the \"Queen of Crime\".[31]: 15 Early in her career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new.\"[36] According to Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?' Then, slowly, she reveals how the impossible is not only possible but the only thing that could have happened.\"[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAbney Hall, Cheshire, the inspiration for Christie novel settings such as Chimneys and Stonygates\n![](image)\nChristie used inspiration from her stay at the Old Cataract Hotel on the banks of the River Nile in Aswan, Egypt for her 1937 novel *Death on the Nile*\n\nChristie developed her storytelling techniques during what has been called the \"Golden Age\" of detective fiction.[119] Author Dilys Winn called Christie \"the doyenne of Coziness\", a sub-genre which \"featured a small village setting, a hero with faintly aristocratic family connections, a plethora of red herrings and a tendency to commit homicide with sterling silver letter openers and poisons imported from Paraguay\".[120] At the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of their deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party; but there are exceptions where it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as *And Then There Were None* and *Endless Night*).[121][122]\n\n\nChristie did not limit herself to quaint English villages – the action might take place on a small island (*And Then There Were None*), an aeroplane (*Death in the Clouds*), a train (*Murder on the Orient Express*), a steamship (*Death on the Nile*), a smart London flat (*Cards on the Table*), a resort in the West Indies (*A Caribbean Mystery*), or an archaeological dig (*Murder in Mesopotamia*) – but the circle of potential suspects is usually closed and intimate: family members, friends, servants, business associates, fellow travellers.[123]: 37 Stereotyped characters abound (the *femme fatale*, the stolid policeman, the devoted servant, the dull colonel), but these may be subverted to stymie the reader; impersonations and secret alliances are always possible.[123]: 58 There is always a motive – most often, money: \"There are very few killers in Christie who enjoy murder for its own sake.\"[14]: 379, 396\n\n\nProfessor of Pharmacology Michael C. Gerald noted that \"in over half her novels, one or more victims are poisoned, albeit not always to the full satisfaction of the perpetrator.\"[124]: viii Guns, knives, garrottes, tripwires, blunt instruments, and even a hatchet were also used, but \"Christie never resorted to elaborate mechanical or scientific means to explain her ingenuity,\"[125]: 57 according to John Curran, author and literary adviser to the Christie estate.[126] Many of her clues are mundane objects: a calendar, a coffee cup, wax flowers, a beer bottle, a fireplace used during a heat wave.[123]: 38\n\n\nAccording to crime writer P. D. James, Christie was prone to making the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Alert readers could sometimes identify the culprit by identifying the least likely suspect.[127] Christie mocked this insight in her foreword to *Cards on the Table*: \"Spot the person least likely to have committed the crime and in nine times out of ten your task is finished. Since I do not want my faithful readers to fling away this book in disgust, I prefer to warn them beforehand *that this is not that kind of book*.\"[128]: 135–36\n\n\nOn BBC Radio 4's *Desert Island Discs* in 2007, Brian Aldiss said Christie had told him she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to \"frame\" that person.[129] Based upon a study of her working notebooks, Curran describes how Christie would first create a cast of characters, choose a setting, and then produce a list of scenes in which specific clues would be revealed; the order of scenes would be revised as she developed her plot. Of necessity, the murderer had to be known to the author before the sequence could be finalised and she began to type or dictate the first draft of her novel.[123] Much of the work, particularly dialogue, was done in her head before she put it on paper.[12]: 241–45[128]: 33\n\n\nIn 2013, the 600 members of the Crime Writers' Association chose *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* as \"the best whodunit ... ever written\".[130] Author Julian Symons observed, \"In an obvious sense, the book fits within the conventions ... The setting is a village deep within the English countryside, Roger Ackroyd dies in his study; there is a butler who behaves suspiciously ... Every successful detective story in this period involved a deceit practised upon the reader, and here the trick is the highly original one of making the murderer the local doctor, who tells the story and acts as Poirot's Watson.\"[119]: 106–07 Critic Sutherland Scott stated, \"If Agatha Christie had made no other contribution to the literature of detective fiction she would still deserve our grateful thanks\" for writing this novel.[131]\n\n\nIn September 2015, to mark her 125th birthday, *And Then There Were None* was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate.[132] The novel is emblematic of both her use of formula and her willingness to discard it. \"*And Then There Were None* carries the 'closed society' type of murder mystery to extreme lengths,\" according to author Charles Osborne.[30]: 170 It begins with the classic set-up of potential victim(s) and killer(s) isolated from the outside world, but then violates conventions. There is no detective involved in the action, no interviews of suspects, no careful search for clues, and no suspects gathered together in the last chapter to be confronted with the solution. As Christie herself said, \"Ten people had to die without it becoming ridiculous or the murderer being obvious.\"[12]: 457 Critics agreed she had succeeded: \"The arrogant Mrs. Christie this time set herself a fearsome test of her own ingenuity ... the reviews, not surprisingly, were without exception wildly adulatory.\"[30]: 170–71\n\n\n\n#### Character stereotypes and racism[edit]\n\n\nFor information on Christie's book originally titled *Ten Little Niggers*, see And Then There Were None.\n\nChristie included stereotyped descriptions of characters in her work, especially before 1945 (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.[4]: 264–66 For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection *The Mysterious Mr Quin*. In 1947, the Anti-Defamation League in the US sent an official letter of complaint to Christie's American publishers, Dodd, Mead and Company, regarding perceived antisemitism in her works. Christie's British literary agent later wrote to her US representative, authorising American publishers to \"omit the word 'Jew' when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books.\"[14]: 386\n\n\nIn *The Hollow*, published in 1946, one of the characters is described by another as \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a corncrake ... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some \"foreign\" characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (*Hallowe'en Party*) and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in *Three Act Tragedy*), but they are rarely the culprits.[133]\n\n\nIn 2023, the *Telegraph* reported that several Agatha Christie novels have been edited to remove potentially offensive language, including insults and references to ethnicity. Poirot and Miss Marple mysteries written between 1920 and 1976 have had passages reworked or removed in new editions published by HarperCollins, in order to strip them of language and descriptions that modern audiences find offensive, especially those involving the characters Christie’s protagonists encounter outside the UK. Sensitivity readers had made the edits, which were evident in digital versions of the new editions, including the entire Miss Marple run and selected Poirot novels set to be released or that have been released since 2020.[134]\n\n\n\n#### Other detectives[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, Christie also created amateur detectives Thomas (Tommy) Beresford and his wife, Prudence \"Tuppence\" *née* Cowley, who appear in four novels and one collection of short stories published between 1922 and 1974. Unlike her other sleuths, the Beresfords were only in their early twenties when introduced in *The Secret Adversary*, and were allowed to age alongside their creator.[30]: 19–20 She treated their stories with a lighter touch, giving them a \"dash and verve\" which was not universally admired by critics.[31]: 63 Their last adventure, *Postern of Fate*, was Christie's last novel.[14]: 477\n\n\nHarley Quin was \"easily the most unorthodox\" of Christie's fictional detectives.[31]: 70 Inspired by Christie's affection for the figures from the Harlequinade, the semi-supernatural Quin always works with an elderly, conventional man called Satterthwaite. The pair appear in 14 short stories, 12 of which were collected in 1930 as *The Mysterious Mr. Quin*.[30]: 78, 80[135] Mallowan described these tales as \"detection in a fanciful vein, touching on the fairy story, a natural product of Agatha's peculiar imagination\".[30]: 80 Satterthwaite also appears in a novel, *Three Act Tragedy*, and a short story, \"Dead Man's Mirror\", both of which feature Poirot.[30]: 81\n\n\nAnother of her lesser-known characters is Parker Pyne, a retired civil servant who assists unhappy people in an unconventional manner.[30]: 118–19 The 12 short stories which introduced him, *Parker Pyne Investigates* (1934), are best remembered for \"The Case of the Discontented Soldier\", which features Ariadne Oliver, \"an amusing and satirical self-portrait of Agatha Christie\". Over the ensuing decades, Oliver reappeared in seven novels. In most of them she assists Poirot.[30]: 120\n\n\n\n#### Plays[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*The Mousetrap*, the world's longest-running play, showing at the West End's St Martin's Theatre in 2011 with the sign signifying the 59th year of the production\n![](image)\nThe wooden counter in the foyer of St Martin's Theatre showing 22,461 performances of *The Mousetrap* (pictured in November 2006). Attendees often get their photo taken next to it.[136]\n\nIn 1928, Michael Morton adapted *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* for the stage under the name of *Alibi*.[4]: 177 The play enjoyed a respectable run, but Christie disliked the changes made to her work and, in future, preferred to write for the theatre herself. The first of her own stage works was *Black Coffee*, which received good reviews when it opened in the West End in late 1930.[137] She followed this up with adaptations of her detective novels: *And Then There Were None* in 1943, *Appointment with Death* in 1945, and *The Hollow* in 1951.[4]: 242, 251, 288\n\n\nIn the 1950s, \"the theatre ... engaged much of Agatha's attention.\"[138] She next adapted her short radio play into *The Mousetrap*, which premiered in the West End in 1952, produced by Peter Saunders and starring Richard Attenborough as the original Detective Sergeant Trotter.[136] Her expectations for the play were not high; she believed it would run no more than eight months.[12]: 500 *The Mousetrap* has long since made theatrical history as the world's longest-running play, staging its 27,500th performance in September 2018.[136][139][140][141] The play temporarily closed in March 2020, when all UK theatres shut due to the coronavirus pandemic,[142][143] before it re-opened on 17 May 2021.[144]\n\n\nIn 1953, she followed this with *Witness for the Prosecution*, whose Broadway production won the New York Drama Critics' Circle award for best foreign play of 1954 and earned Christie an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America.[4]: 300[125]: 262 *Spider's Web*, an original work written for actress Margaret Lockwood at her request, premiered in the West End in 1954 and was also a hit.[4]: 297, 300 Christie became the first female playwright to have three plays running simultaneously in London: *The Mousetrap*, *Witness for the Prosecution* and *Spider's Web*.[145] She said, \"Plays are much easier to *write* than books, because you can *see* them in your mind's eye, you are not hampered by all that description which clogs you so terribly in a book and stops you from getting on with what's happening.\"[12]: 459 In a letter to her daughter, Christie said being a playwright was \"a lot of fun!\"[14]: 474\n\n\n\n#### As Mary Westmacott[edit]\n\n\nChristie published six mainstream novels under the name Mary Westmacott, a pseudonym which gave her the freedom to explore \"her most private and precious imaginative garden\".[14]: 366–67[30]: 87–88 These books typically received better reviews than her detective and thriller fiction.[14]: 366 Of the first, *Giant's Bread* published in 1930, a reviewer for *The New York Times* wrote, \"... her book is far above the average of current fiction, in fact, comes well under the classification of a 'good book'. And it is only a satisfying novel that can claim that appellation.\"[146] It was publicized from the very beginning that \"Mary Westmacott\" was a pen name of a well-known author, although the identity behind the pen name was kept secret; the dust jacket of *Giant's Bread* mentions that the author had previously written \"under her real name...half a dozen books that have each passed the thirty thousand mark in sales.\" (In fact, though this was technically true, it disguised Christie's identity through understatement. By the publication of *Giant's Bread*, Christie had published 10 novels and two short story collections, all of which had sold considerably more than 30,000 copies.) After Christie's authorship of the first four Westmacott novels was revealed by a journalist in 1949, she wrote two more, the last in 1956.[14]: 366\n\n\nThe other Westmacott titles are: *Unfinished Portrait* (1934), *Absent in the Spring* (1944), *The Rose and the Yew Tree* (1948), *A Daughter's a Daughter* (1952), and *The Burden* (1956).\n\n\n\n### Non-fiction works[edit]\n\n\nChristie published a few non-fiction works. *Come, Tell Me How You Live*, about working on an archaeological dig, was drawn from her life with Mallowan. *The Grand Tour: Around the World with the Queen of Mystery* is a collection of correspondence from her 1922 Grand Tour of the British Empire, including South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. *Agatha Christie: An Autobiography* was published posthumously in 1977 and adjudged the Best Critical/Biographical Work at the 1978 Edgar Awards.[147]\n\n\n\n### Titles[edit]\n\n\nMany of Christie's works from 1940 onward have titles drawn from literature, with the original context of the title typically printed as an epigraph.[148]\n\n\nThe inspirations for some of Christie's titles include:\n\n\n\n* William Shakespeare's works: *Sad Cypress*, *By the Pricking of My Thumbs*, *There is a Tide ...*, *Absent in the Spring*, and *The Mousetrap*, for example. Osborne notes that \"Shakespeare is the writer most quoted in the works of Agatha Christie\";[30]: 164\n* The Bible: *Evil Under the Sun*, *The Burden*, and *The Pale Horse*;\n* Other works of literature: *The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side* (from Tennyson's \"The Lady of Shalott\"), *The Moving Finger* (from Edward FitzGerald's translation of the *Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám*), *The Rose and the Yew Tree* (from T. S. Eliot's *Four Quartets*), *Postern of Fate* (from James Elroy Flecker's \"Gates of Damascus\"), *Endless Night* (from William Blake's \"Auguries of Innocence\"), *N or M?* (from the *Book of Common Prayer*), and *Come, Tell Me How You Live* (from Lewis Carroll's *Through the Looking-Glass*).\n\n\nChristie biographer Gillian Gill said, \"Christie's writing has the sparseness, the directness, the narrative pace, and the universal appeal of the fairy story, and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown-up children that Christie's novels succeed.\"[128]: 208 Reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror, numerous Christie titles were drawn from well-known children's nursery rhymes: *And Then There Were None* (from \"Ten Little Niggers\", a rhyme also published as \"Ten Little Indians\", both of which were also used for the book's title in some printings),[149] *One, Two, Buckle My Shoe* (from \"One, Two, Buckle My Shoe\"), *Five Little Pigs* (from \"This Little Piggy\"), *Crooked House* (from \"There Was a Crooked Man\"), *A Pocket Full of Rye* (from \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\"), *Hickory Dickory Dock* (from \"Hickory Dickory Dock\"), and *Three Blind Mice* (from \"Three Blind Mice\").[128]: 207–08\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a large, book-shaped bronze memorial](image)Memorial to Christie in central London\nChristie is regularly referred to as the \"Queen of Crime\"—which is now trademarked by the Christie estate—or \"Queen of Mystery\", and is considered a master of suspense, plotting, and characterisation.[150][151][152][153] In 1955, she became the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's Grand Master Award.[147] She was named \"Best Writer of the Century\" and the Hercule Poirot series of books was named \"Best Series of the Century\" at the 2000 Bouchercon World Mystery Convention.[154] In 2013, she was voted \"best crime writer\" in a survey of 600 members of the Crime Writers' Association of professional novelists.[130] However, the writer Raymond Chandler criticised the artificiality of her books, as did writer Julian Symons.[155][119]: 100–30 The literary critic Edmund Wilson described her prose as banal and her characterisations as superficial.[156][j]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"With Christie ... we are dealing not so much with a literary figure as with a broad cultural phenomenon, like Barbie or the Beatles.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Joan Acocella writing in *The New Yorker*[159]\n\nIn 2011, Christie was named by the digital crime drama TV channel Alibi as the second most financially successful crime writer of all time in the United Kingdom, after James Bond author Ian Fleming, with total earnings around £100 million.[160] In 2012, Christie was among the people selected by the artist Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous work, the Beatles' *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* album cover, \"to celebrate the British cultural figures he most admires\".[161][162] On the record-breaking longevity of Christie's *The Mousetrap* which had marked its 60th anniversary in 2012, Stephen Moss in *The Guardian* wrote, \"the play and its author are the stars\".[136]\n\n\nIn 2015, marking the 125th anniversary of her birth date, 25 contemporary mystery writers and one publisher gave their views on Christie's works. Many of the authors had read Christie's novels first, before other mystery writers, in English or in their native language, influencing their own writing, and nearly all still viewed her as the \"Queen of Crime\" and creator of the plot twists used by mystery authors. Nearly all had one or more favourites among Christie's mysteries and found her books still good to read nearly 100 years after her first novel was published. Just one of the 25 authors held with Wilson's views.[163]\n\n\n\n### Book sales[edit]\n\n\nIn her prime, Christie was rarely out of the bestseller list.[164] She was the first crime writer to have 100,000 copies of 10 of her titles published by Penguin on the same day in 1948.[165][166] As of 2018[update], *Guinness World Records* listed Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time.[167] As of 2020[update], her novels had sold more than two billion copies in 44 languages.[167] Half the sales are of English-language editions, and half are translations.[168][169] According to Index Translationum, as of 2020[update], she was the most-translated individual author.[170][171]\n\n\nChristie is one of the most-borrowed authors in UK libraries.[172][173][174][175] She is also the UK's best-selling spoken-book author. In 2002, 117,696 Christie audiobooks were sold, in comparison to 97,755 for J. K. Rowling, 78,770 for Roald Dahl and 75,841 for J. R. R. Tolkien.[176][177] In 2015, the Christie estate claimed *And Then There Were None* was \"the best-selling crime novel of all time\",[178] with approximately 100 million sales, also making it one of the highest-selling books of all time.[132][179] More than two million copies of her books were sold in English in 2020.[180]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Commemorative blue plaque in the West End marking *The Mousetrap* as the world's longest-running play\nIn 2016, the Royal Mail marked the centenary of Christie's first detective story by issuing six first-class postage stamps of her works: *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd*, *Murder on the Orient Express*, *And Then There Were None*, *The Body in the Library*, and *A Murder is Announced*. *The Guardian* reported that, \"Each design incorporates microtext, UV ink and thermochromic ink. These concealed clues can be revealed using either a magnifying glass, UV light or body heat and provide pointers to the mysteries' solutions.\"[181][182]\n\n\nHer characters and her face appeared on the stamps of many countries like Dominica and the Somali Republic.[183] In 2020, Christie was commemorated on a £2 coin by the Royal Mint for the first time to mark the centenary of her first novel, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*.[184]\n\n\nIn 2023 a life-size bronze statue of Christie sitting on a park bench holding a book was unveiled in Wallingford.[185]\n\n\n\n### Adaptations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adaptations of Agatha Christie\n\nChristie's works have been adapted for cinema and television. The first was the 1928 British film *The Passing of Mr. Quin*. Poirot's first film appearance was in 1931 in *Alibi*, which starred Austin Trevor as Christie's sleuth.[186]: 14–18 Margaret Rutherford played Marple in a series of films released in the 1960s. Christie liked her acting, but considered the first film \"pretty poor\" and thought no better of the rest.[14]: 430–31\nShe felt differently about the 1974 film *Murder on the Orient Express*, directed by Sidney Lumet, which featured major stars and high production values; her attendance at the London premiere was one of her last public outings.[14]: 476, 482[186]: 57 In 2017, a new film version was released, directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also starred, wearing \"the most extravagant mustache moviegoers have ever seen\".[187] Branagh has since directed two more adaptations of Christie, *Death on the Nile* (2022) and its sequel *A Haunting in Venice* (2023), the latter an adaptation of her 1969 novel *Hallowe'en Party*.[188][189]\n\n\nThe television adaptation *Agatha Christie's Poirot* (1989–2013), with David Suchet in the title role, ran for 70 episodes over 13 series. It received nine BAFTA award nominations and won four BAFTA awards in 1990–1992.[190] The television series *Miss Marple* (1984–1992), with Joan Hickson as \"the BBC's peerless Miss Marple\", adapted all 12 Marple novels.[14]: 500 The French television series *Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie* (2009–2012, 2013–2020), adapted 36 of Christie's stories.[191][192]\n\n\nChristie's books have also been adapted for BBC Radio, a video game series, and graphic novels.[193][194][195][196]\n\n\n\n## Interests and influences[edit]\n\n\n### Pharmacology[edit]\n\n\nDuring the First World War, Christie took a break from nursing to train for the Apothecaries Hall Examination.[124]: xi While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up to date at Torquay Hospital.[12]: 235, 470\n\n\nAs Michael C. Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons ... These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories.\"[124]: viii There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists, and scientists, naïve or suspicious, in Christie's cast of characters; featuring in *Murder in Mesopotamia*, *Cards on the Table*, *The Pale Horse*, and *Mrs. McGinty's Dead*, among many others.[124]\n\n\nGillian Gill notes that the murder method in Christie's first detective novel, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, \"comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary\".[128]: 34 In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don't like messy deaths ... I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"[197] With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under Ronald Knox's \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".[125]: 58 Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, nicotine, thallium, and other substances were used to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades.[124]\n\n\n\n### Archaeology[edit]\n\n\n> \n> The lure of the past came up to grab me. To see a dagger slowly appearing, with its gold glint, through the sand was romantic. The carefulness of lifting pots and objects from the soil filled me with a longing to be an archaeologist myself.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAgatha Christie[12]: 364\n\nIn her youth, Christie showed little interest in antiquities.[14]: 68 After her marriage to Mallowan in 1930, she accompanied him on annual expeditions, spending three to four months at a time in Syria and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, Nineveh, Tell Arpachiyah, Chagar Bazar, Tell Brak, and Nimrud.[14]: 301, 304, 313, 414 The Mallowans also took side trips whilst travelling to and from expedition sites, visiting Italy, Greece, Egypt, Iran, and the Soviet Union, among other places.[4]: 188–91, 199, 212[12]: 429–37 Their experiences travelling and living abroad are reflected in novels such as *Murder on the Orient Express*, *Death on the Nile*, and *Appointment with Death*.[14]: 514 (n. 6)[198]\n\n\nFor the 1931 digging season at Nineveh, Christie bought a writing table to continue her own work; in the early 1950s, she paid to add a small writing room to the team's house at Nimrud.[14]: 301[30]: 244 She also devoted time and effort each season in \"making herself useful by photographing, cleaning, and recording finds; and restoring ceramics, which she especially enjoyed\".[199][31]: 20–21 She also provided funds for the expeditions.[14]: 414\n\n\nMany of the settings for Christie's books were inspired by her archaeological fieldwork in the Middle East; this is reflected in the detail with which she describes them – for instance, the temple of Abu Simbel as depicted in *Death on the Nile* – while the settings for *They Came to Baghdad* were places she and Mallowan had recently stayed.[4]: 212, 283–84 Similarly, she drew upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig throughout *Murder in Mesopotamia*.[123]: 269 Archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts featured in her works include Dr Eric Leidner in *Murder in Mesopotamia* and Signor Richetti in *Death on the Nile*.[200]: 187, 226–27\n\n\nAfter the Second World War, Christie chronicled her time in Syria in *Come, Tell Me How You Live*, which she described as \"small beer – a very little book, full of everyday doings and happenings\".[201]: (Foreword) From 8 November 2001 to March 2002, The British Museum presented a \"colourful and episodic exhibition\" called *Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia* which illustrated how her activities as a writer and as the wife of an archaeologist intertwined.[202]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nSome of Christie's fictional portrayals have explored and offered accounts of her disappearance in 1926. The film *Agatha* (1979), with Vanessa Redgrave, has Christie sneaking away to plan revenge against her husband; Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution.[203] The *Doctor Who* episode \"The Unicorn and the Wasp\" (17 May 2008) stars Fenella Woolgar as Christie, and explains her disappearance as being connected to aliens. The film *Agatha and the Truth of Murder* (2018) sends her undercover to solve the murder of Florence Nightingale's goddaughter, Florence Nightingale Shore. A fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, *Agatha*.[204] *The Christie Affair*, a Christie-like mystery story of love and revenge by author Nina de Gramont, was a 2022 novel loosely based on Christie's disappearance.[205]\n\n\nOther portrayals, such as the Hungarian film *Kojak Budapesten* (1980), create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skills. In the TV play *Murder by the Book* (1986), Christie (Dame Peggy Ashcroft) murders one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's *Dorothy and Agatha* and *The London Blitz Murders* by Max Allan Collins.[206][207] The American television program *Unsolved Mysteries* devoted a segment to her famous disappearance, with Agatha portrayed by actress Tessa Pritchard. A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series *Gran Hotel* (2011) in which she finds inspiration to write her new novel while aiding local detectives. In the alternative history television film *Agatha and the Curse of Ishtar* (2018), Christie becomes involved in a murder case at an archaeological dig in Iraq.[208] In 2019, Honeysuckle Weeks portrayed Christie in an episode, \"No Friends Like Old Friends\", in a Canadian drama, *Frankie Drake Mysteries.*\n\n\nIn 2020, Heather Terrell, under the pseudonym of Marie Benedict, published *The Mystery of Mrs. Christie*, a fictional reconstruction of Christie's December 1926 disappearance. The novel was on the *USA Today* and *The New York Times* Best Seller lists.[209][210] In December 2020, Library Reads named Terrell a Hall of Fame author for the book.[211]\nAndrew Wilson has written four novels featuring Agatha Christie as a detective: *A Talent For Murder* (2017), *A Different Kind of Evil* (2018), *Death In A Desert Land* (2019) and *I Saw Him Die* (2020).[212] Christie was portrayed by Shirley Henderson in the 2022 comedy/mystery film *See How They Run*.[213][214]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Agatha Christie indult (an oecumenical request to which Christie was signatory seeking permission for the occasional use of the Tridentine (Latin) mass in England and Wales)\n* Agatha Awards (literary awards for mystery and crime writers)\n* Agatha Christie Award (Japan) (literary award for unpublished mystery novels)\n* List of solved missing person cases\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Most biographers give Christie's mother's place of birth as Belfast but do not provide sources. Current primary evidence, including census entries (place of birth Dublin), her baptism record (Dublin), and her father's service record and regimental history (when her father was in Dublin), indicates she was almost certainly born in Dublin in the first quarter of 1854.[8][9][10]\n2. **^** Boehmer's death registration states he died at age 49 from bronchitis after retiring from the army,[11] but Christie and her biographers have consistently claimed he was killed in a riding accident while still a serving officer.[12]: 5[13][4]: 2[14]: 9–10\n3. **^** Dorothy L. Sayers, who visited the \"scene of the disappearance\", later incorporated details in her book *Unnatural Death*.[40]\n4. **^** The notice placed by Christie in *The Times* (11 December 1926, p.1) gives the first name as Teresa, but her hotel register signature more naturally reads Tressa; newspapers reported that Christie used Tressa on other occasions during her disappearance (including joining a library).[45]\n5. **^** Christie hinted at a nervous breakdown, saying to a woman with similar symptoms, \"I think you had better be very careful; it is probably the beginning of a nervous breakdown.\"[12]: 337\n6. **^** Christie's authorised biographer includes an account of specialist psychiatric treatment following Christie's disappearance, but the information was obtained second or third hand after her death.[4]: 148–49, 159\n7. **^** Other authors claim Christie wrote *Murder on the Orient Express* whilst at a dig at Arpachiyah.[4]: 206[30]: 111\n8. **^** According to other sources, her estate was valued at £147 810.[90]\n9. **^** Christie's familial relationship to Margaret Miller (née West) was complex. As well as being Christie's maternal great-aunt, Miller was Christie's father's step-mother as well as Christie's mother's foster mother and step-mother-in-law – hence the appellation \"Auntie-Grannie\".\n10. **^** Wilson's 1945 essay, \"Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?\" was dismissive of the detective fiction genre in general but did not mention Christie by name.[157][158]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Most translated author\". *Guinness World Records*. 7 March 2017.\n2. **^** \"Result of world's favourite Christie global vote\". *Agatha Christie*. 22 December 2015.

His collaboration with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel led to the creation of the *Voyages extraordinaires*,[3] a series of bestselling adventure novels including *Journey to the Center of the Earth* (1864), *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas* (1870), and *Around the World in Eighty Days* (1872). His novels, always well documented, are generally set in the second half of the 19th century, taking into account the technological advances of the time.\n\n\nIn addition to his novels, he wrote numerous plays, short stories, autobiographical accounts, poetry, songs, and scientific, artistic, and literary studies. His work has been adapted for film and television since the beginning of cinema, as well as for comic books, theater, opera, music and video games.\n\n\nVerne is considered to be an important author in France and most of Europe, where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism.[4] His reputation was markedly different in the Anglosphere where he had often been labeled a writer of genre fiction or children's books, largely because of the highly abridged and altered translations in which his novels have often been printed. Since the 1980s, his literary reputation has improved.[5]\n\n\nJules Verne has been the second most-translated author in the world since 1979, ranking below Agatha Christie and above William Shakespeare.[6] He has sometimes been called the \"father of science fiction\", a title that has also been given to H. G. Wells and Hugo Gernsback.[7] In the 2010s, he was the most translated French author in the world. In France, 2005 was declared \"Jules Verne Year\" on the occasion of the centenary of the writer's death.\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nantes from Île Feydeau, around the time of Verne's birth\nVerne was born on 8 February 1828, on Île Feydeau, a then small artificial island on the river Loire within the town of Nantes (later filled-in and incorporated into the surrounding land-area), in No. 4 Rue Olivier-de-Clisson, the house of his maternal grandmother Dame Sophie Marie Adélaïde Julienne Allotte de La Fuÿe (born Guillochet de La Perrière).[8] His parents were Pierre Verne, an attorney originally from Provins, and Sophie Allotte de La Fuÿe, a Nantes woman from a local family of navigators and shipowners, of distant Scottish descent.[9][b] In 1829, the Verne family moved some hundred metres away to No. 2 Quai Jean-Bart, where Verne's brother Paul was born the same year. Three sisters, Anne \"Anna\" (1836), Mathilde (1839), and Marie (1842) would follow.[9]\n\n\nIn 1834, at the age of six, Verne was sent to boarding school at 5 Place du Bouffay in Nantes. The teacher, Madame Sambin, was the widow of a naval captain who had disappeared some 30 years before.[10] Madame Sambin often told the students that her husband was a shipwrecked castaway and that he would eventually return like Robinson Crusoe from his desert island paradise.[11] The theme of the robinsonade would stay with Verne throughout his life and appear in many of his novels, some of which include *The Mysterious Island* (1874), *Second Fatherland* (1900), and *The School for Robinsons* (1882).\n\n\nIn 1836, Verne went on to École Saint‑Stanislas, a Catholic school suiting the pious religious tastes of his father. Verne quickly distinguished himself in *mémoire* (recitation from memory), geography, Greek, Latin, and singing.[12] In the same year, 1836, Pierre Verne bought a vacation house at 29 Rue des Réformés in the village of Chantenay (now part of Nantes) on the Loire.[13] In his brief memoir *Souvenirs d'enfance et de jeunesse* (*Memories of Childhood and Youth*, 1890), Verne recalled a deep fascination with the river and with the many merchant vessels navigating it.[14] He also took vacations at Brains, in the house of his uncle Prudent Allotte, a retired shipowner, who had gone around the world and served as mayor of Brains from 1828 to 1837. Verne took joy in playing interminable rounds of the Game of the Goose with his uncle, and both the game and his uncle's name would be memorialized in two late novels (*The Will of an Eccentric* (1900) and *Robur the Conqueror* (1886), respectively).[14][15]\n\n\nLegend has it that in 1839, at the age of 11, Verne secretly procured a spot as cabin boy on the three-mast ship *Coralie* with the intention of traveling to the Indies and bringing back a coral necklace for his cousin Caroline. The evening the ship set out for the Indies, it stopped first at Paimboeuf where Pierre Verne arrived just in time to catch his son and make him promise to travel \"only in his imagination\".[16] It is now known that the legend is an exaggerated tale invented by Verne's first biographer, his niece Marguerite Allotte de la Füye, though it may have been inspired by a real incident.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Lycée Royal in Nantes (now the Georges-Clemenceau), where Verne studied\nIn 1840, the Vernes moved again to a large apartment at No. 6 Rue Jean-Jacques-Rousseau, where the family's youngest child, Marie, was born in 1842.[13] In the same year Verne entered another religious school, the Petit Séminaire de Saint-Donatien, as a lay student. His unfinished novel *Un prêtre en 1839* (*A Priest in 1839*), written in his teens and the earliest of his prose works to survive,[18] describes the seminary in disparaging terms.[12] From 1844 to 1846, Verne and his brother were enrolled in the Lycée Royal (now the Lycée Georges-Clemenceau) in Nantes. After finishing classes in rhetoric and philosophy, he took the baccalauréat at Rennes and received the grade \"Good Enough\" on 29 July 1846.[19]\n\n\nBy 1847, when Verne was 19, he had taken seriously to writing long works in the style of Victor Hugo, beginning *Un prêtre en 1839* and seeing two verse tragedies, *Alexandre VI* and *La Conspiration des poudres* (*The Gunpowder Plot*), to completion.[18] However, his father took it for granted that Verne, being the firstborn son of the family, would not attempt to make money in literature but would instead inherit the family law practice.[20]\n\n\nIn 1847, Verne's father sent him to Paris, primarily to begin his studies in law school, and secondarily (according to family legend) to distance him temporarily from Nantes.[21][22] His cousin Caroline, with whom he was in love, was married on 27 April 1847, to Émile Dezaunay, a man of 40, with whom she would have five children.[23]\n\n\nAfter a short stay in Paris, where he passed first-year law exams, Verne returned to Nantes for his father's help in preparing for the second year. (Provincial law students were in that era required to go to Paris to take exams.)[24] While in Nantes, he met Rose Herminie Arnaud Grossetière, a young woman one year his senior, and fell intensely in love with her. He wrote and dedicated some thirty poems to her, including *La Fille de l'air* (*The Daughter of Air*), which describes her as \"blonde and enchanting / winged and transparent\".[25] His passion seems to have been reciprocated, at least for a short time,[22] but Grossetière's parents frowned upon the idea of their daughter marrying a young student of uncertain future. They married her instead to Armand Terrien de la Haye, a rich landowner ten years her senior, on 19 July 1848.[26]\n\n\nThe sudden marriage sent Verne into deep frustration. He wrote a hallucinatory letter to his mother, apparently composed in a state of half-drunkenness, in which under pretext of a dream he described his misery.[27] This requited but aborted love affair seems to have permanently marked the author and his work, and his novels include a significant number of young women married against their will (Gérande in *Master Zacharius* (1854), Sava in *Mathias Sandorf* (1885), Ellen in *A Floating City* (1871), etc.), to such an extent that the scholar Christian Chelebourg attributed the recurring theme to a \"Herminie complex\".[28] The incident also led Verne to bear a grudge against his birthplace and Nantes society, which he criticized in his poem *La sixième ville de France* (*The Sixth City of France*).[29][30]\n\n\n\n### Studies in Paris[edit]\n\n\nIn July 1848, Verne left Nantes again for Paris, where his father intended him to finish law studies and take up law as a profession. He obtained permission from his father to rent a furnished apartment at 24 Rue de l'Ancienne-Comédie, which he shared with Édouard Bonamy, another student of Nantes origin.[27] (On his 1847 Paris visit, Verne had stayed at 2 Rue Thérèse, the house of his aunt Charuel, on the Butte Saint-Roch.)[31]\n\n\nVerne arrived in Paris during a time of political upheaval: the French Revolution of 1848. In February, Louis Philippe I had been overthrown and had fled; on 24 February, a provisional government of the French Second Republic took power, but political demonstrations continued, and social tension remained. In June, barricades went up in Paris, and the government sent Louis-Eugène Cavaignac to crush the insurrection. Verne entered the city shortly before the election of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte as the first president of the Republic, a state of affairs that would last until the French coup of 1851. In a letter to his family, Verne described the bombarded state of the city after the recent June Days uprising but assured them that the anniversary of Bastille Day had gone by without any significant conflict.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)Aristide Hignard\nVerne used his family connections to make an entrance into Paris society. His uncle Francisque de Chatêaubourg introduced him into literary salons, and Verne particularly frequented those of Mme de Barrère, a friend of his mother's.[33] While continuing his law studies, he fed his passion for the theater, writing numerous plays. Verne later recalled: \"I was greatly under the influence of Victor Hugo, indeed, very excited by reading and re-reading his works. At that time I could have recited by heart whole pages of *Notre Dame de Paris*, but it was his dramatic work that most influenced me.\"[34] Another source of creative stimulation came from a neighbor: living on the same floor in the Rue de l'Ancienne-Comédie apartment house was a young composer, Aristide Hignard, with whom Verne soon became good friends, and Verne wrote several texts for Hignard to set as chansons.[35]\n\n\nDuring this period, Verne's letters to his parents primarily focused on expenses and on a suddenly appearing series of violent stomach cramps,[36] the first of many he would suffer from during his life. (Modern scholars have hypothesized that he suffered from colitis;[36] Verne believed the illness to have been inherited from his mother's side.[37]) Rumors of an outbreak of cholera in March 1849 exacerbated these medical concerns.[36] Yet another health problem would strike in 1851 when Verne suffered the first of four attacks of facial paralysis. These attacks, rather than being psychosomatic, were due to an inflammation in the middle ear, though this cause remained unknown to Verne during his life.[38]\n\n\nIn the same year, Verne was required to enlist in the French army, but the sortition process spared him, to his great relief. He wrote to his father: \"You should already know, dear papa, what I think of the military life, and of these domestic servants in livery. … You have to abandon all dignity to perform such functions.\"[39] Verne's strong antiwar sentiments, to the dismay of his father, would remain steadfast throughout his life.[39]\n\n\nThough writing profusely and frequenting the salons, Verne diligently pursued his law studies and graduated with a *licence en droit* in January 1851.[40]\n\n\n\n### Literary debut[edit]\n\n\nThanks to his visits to salons, Verne came into contact in 1849 with Alexandre Dumas through the mutual acquaintance of a celebrated chirologist of the time, the Chevalier d'Arpentigny.[40] Verne became close friends with Dumas' son, Alexandre Dumas fils, and showed him a manuscript for a stage comedy, *Les Pailles rompues* (*The Broken Straws*). The two young men revised the play together, and Dumas, through arrangements with his father, had it produced by the Opéra-National at the Théâtre Historique in Paris, opening on 12 June 1850.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cover of an 1854–55 issue of *Musée des familles*\nIn 1851, Verne met with a fellow writer from Nantes, Pierre-Michel-François Chevalier (known as \"Pitre-Chevalier\"), the editor-in-chief of the magazine *Musée des familles* (*The Family Museum*).[42] Pitre-Chevalier was looking for articles about geography, history, science, and technology, and was keen to make sure that the educational component would be made accessible to large popular audiences using a straightforward prose style or an engaging fictional story. Verne, with his delight in diligent research, especially in geography, was a natural for the job.[43] Verne first offered him a short historical adventure story, *The First Ships of the Mexican Navy*, written in the style of James Fenimore Cooper, whose novels had deeply influenced him.[42] Pitre-Chevalier published it in July 1851, and in the same year published a second short story by Verne, *A Voyage in a Balloon* (August 1851). The latter story, with its combination of adventurous narrative, travel themes, and detailed historical research, would later be described by Verne as \"the first indication of the line of novel that I was destined to follow\".[34]\n\n\nDumas fils put Verne in contact with Jules Seveste, a stage director who had taken over the directorship of the Théâtre Historique and renamed it the Théâtre Lyrique. Seveste offered Verne the job of secretary of the theater, with little or no salary attached.[9] Verne accepted, using the opportunity to write and produce several comic operas written in collaboration with Hignard and the prolific librettist Michel Carré.[44] To celebrate his employment at the Théâtre Lyrique, Verne joined with ten friends to found a bachelors' dining club, the *Onze-sans-femme* (*Eleven Bachelors*).[45]\n\n\nFor some time, Verne's father pressed him to abandon his writing and begin a business as a lawyer. However, Verne argued in his letters that he could only find success in literature.[46] The pressure to plan for a secure future in law reached its climax in January 1852, when his father offered Verne his own Nantes law practice.[47] Faced with this ultimatum, Verne decided conclusively to continue his literary life and refuse the job, writing: \"Am I not right to follow my own instincts? It's because I know who I am that I realize what I can be one day.\"[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jacques Arago\nMeanwhile, Verne was spending much time at the Bibliothèque nationale de France, conducting research for his stories and feeding his passion for science and recent discoveries, especially in geography. It was in this period that Verne met the illustrious geographer and explorer Jacques Arago, who continued to travel extensively despite his blindness (he had lost his sight completely in 1837). The two men became good friends, and Arago's innovative and witty accounts of his travels led Verne toward a newly developing genre of literature: that of travel writing.[49][50]\n\n\nIn 1852, two new pieces from Verne appeared in the *Musée des familles*: *Martin Paz*, a novella set in Lima, which Verne wrote in 1851 and published 10 July through 11 August 1852, and *Les Châteaux en Californie, ou, Pierre qui roule n'amasse pas mousse* (*The Castles in California, or, A Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss*), a one-act comedy full of racy double entendres.[51] In April and May 1854, the magazine published Verne's short story *Master Zacharius*, an E. T. A. Hoffmann-like fantasy featuring a sharp condemnation of scientific hubris and ambition,[52] followed soon afterward by *A Winter Amid the Ice*, a polar adventure story whose themes closely anticipated many of Verne's novels.[53] The *Musée* also published some nonfiction popular science articles which, though unsigned, are generally attributed to Verne.[43] Verne's work for the magazine was cut short in 1856 when he had a serious quarrel with Pitre-Chevalier and refused to continue contributing (a refusal he would maintain until 1863, when Pitre-Chevalier died, and the magazine went to new editorship).[54]\n\n\nWhile writing stories and articles for Pitre-Chevalier, Verne began to form the idea of inventing a new kind of novel, a \"Roman de la Science\" (\"novel of science\"), which would allow him to incorporate large amounts of the factual information he so enjoyed researching in the Bibliothèque. He is said to have discussed the project with the elder Alexandre Dumas, who had tried something similar with an unfinished novel, *Isaac Laquedem*, and who enthusiastically encouraged Verne's project.[55]\n\n\nAt the end of 1854, another outbreak of cholera led to the death of Jules Seveste, Verne's employer at the Théâtre Lyrique and by then a good friend.[53] Though his contract only held him to a further year of service, Verne remained connected to the theater for several years after Seveste's death, seeing additional productions to fruition.[56] He also continued to write plays and musical comedies, most of which were not performed.[54]\n\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\nIn May 1856, Verne traveled to Amiens to be the best man at the wedding of a Nantes friend, Auguste Lelarge, to an Amiens woman named Aimée du Fraysne de Viane. Verne, invited to stay with the bride's family, took to them warmly, befriending the entire household and finding himself increasingly attracted to the bride's sister, Honorine Anne Hébée Morel (née du Fraysne de Viane), a widow aged 26 with two young children.[57][58] Hoping to find a secure source of income, as well as a chance to court Morel in earnest, he jumped at her brother's offer to go into business with a broker.[59] Verne's father was initially dubious but gave in to his son's requests for approval in November 1856. With his financial situation finally looking promising, Verne won the favor of Morel and her family, and the couple were married on 10 January 1857.[60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jules Verne Museum, Butte Saint-Anne, Nantes, France\nVerne plunged into his new business obligations, leaving his work at the Théâtre Lyrique and taking up a full-time job as an *agent de change*[54] on the Paris Bourse, where he became the associate of the broker Fernand Eggly.[61] Verne woke up early each morning so that he would have time to write, before going to the Bourse for the day's work; in the rest of his spare time, he continued to consort with the *Onze-Sans-Femme* club (all eleven of its \"bachelors\" had by this time married). He also continued to frequent the Bibliothèque to do scientific and historical research, much of which he copied onto notecards for future use—a system he would continue for the rest of his life.[54] According to the recollections of a colleague, Verne \"did better in repartee than in business\".[61]\n\n\nIn July 1858, Verne and Aristide Hignard seized an opportunity offered by Hignard's brother: a sea voyage, at no charge, from Bordeaux to Liverpool and Scotland. The journey, Verne's first trip outside France, deeply impressed him, and upon his return to Paris he fictionalized his recollections to form the backbone of a semi-autobiographical novel, *Backwards to Britain* (written in the autumn and winter of 1859–1860 and not published until 1989).[62] A second complimentary voyage in 1861 took Hignard and Verne to Stockholm, from where they traveled to Christiania and through Telemark.[63] Verne left Hignard in Denmark to return in haste to Paris, but missed the birth on 3 August 1861 of his only biological son, Michel.[64]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Verne continued work on the idea of a \"Roman de la Science\", which he developed in a rough draft, inspired, according to his recollections, by his \"love for maps and the great explorers of the world\". It took shape as a story of travel across Africa and would eventually become his first published novel, *Five Weeks in a Balloon*.[54]\n\n\n\n### Hetzel[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pierre-Jules Hetzel\nIn 1862, through their mutual acquaintance Alfred de Bréhat, Verne came into contact with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, and submitted to him the manuscript of his developing novel, then called *Voyage en Ballon*.[65] Hetzel, already the publisher of Honoré de Balzac, George Sand, Victor Hugo, and other well-known authors, had long been planning to launch a high-quality family magazine in which entertaining fiction would combine with scientific education.[66] He saw Verne, with his demonstrated inclination toward scrupulously researched adventure stories, as an ideal contributor for such a magazine, and accepted the novel, giving Verne suggestions for improvement. Verne made the proposed revisions within two weeks and returned to Hetzel with the final draft, now titled *Five Weeks in a Balloon*.[67] It was published by Hetzel on 31 January 1863.[68]\n\n\nTo secure his services for the planned magazine, to be called the *Magasin d'Éducation et de Récréation* (*Magazine of Education and Recreation*), Hetzel also drew up a long-term contract in which Verne would give him three volumes of text per year, each of which Hetzel would buy outright for a flat fee. Verne, finding both a steady salary and a sure outlet for writing at last, accepted immediately.[69] For the rest of his lifetime, most of his novels would be serialized in Hetzel's *Magasin* before their appearance in book form, beginning with his second novel for Hetzel, *The Adventures of Captain Hatteras* (1864–65).[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Hetzel edition of Verne's *The Adventures of Captain Hatteras* (cover style \"Aux deux éléphants\")\nWhen *The Adventures of Captain Hatteras* was published in book form in 1866, Hetzel publicly announced his literary and educational ambitions for Verne's novels by saying in a preface that Verne's works would form a novel sequence called the *Voyages extraordinaires* (*Extraordinary Voyages* or *Extraordinary Journeys*), and that Verne's aim was \"to outline all the geographical, geological, physical, and astronomical knowledge amassed by modern science and to recount, in an entertaining and picturesque format that is his own, the history of the universe\".[70] Late in life, Verne confirmed that this commission had become the running theme of his novels: \"My object has been to depict the earth, and not the earth alone, but the universe… And I have tried at the same time to realize a very high ideal of beauty of style. It is said that there can't be any style in a novel of adventure, but it isn't true.\"[71] However, he also noted that the project was extremely ambitious: \"Yes! But the Earth is very large, and life is very short! In order to leave a completed work behind, one would need to live to be at least 100 years old!\"[72]\n\n\nHetzel influenced many of Verne's novels directly, especially in the first few years of their collaboration, for Verne was initially so happy to find a publisher that he agreed to almost all of the changes Hetzel suggested. For example, when Hetzel disapproved of the original climax of *Captain Hatteras*, including the death of the title character, Verne wrote an entirely new conclusion in which Hatteras survived.[73] Hetzel also rejected Verne's next submission, *Paris in the Twentieth Century*, believing its pessimistic view of the future and its condemnation of technological progress were too subversive for a family magazine.[74] (The manuscript, believed lost for some time after Verne's death, was finally published in 1994.)[75]\n\n\nThe relationship between publisher and writer changed significantly around 1869 when Verne and Hetzel were brought into conflict over the manuscript for *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas*. Verne had initially conceived of the submariner Captain Nemo as a Polish scientist whose acts of vengeance were directed against the Russians who had killed his family during the January Uprising. Hetzel, not wanting to alienate the lucrative Russian market for Verne's books, demanded that Nemo be made an enemy of the slave trade, a situation that would make him an unambiguous hero. Verne, after fighting vehemently against the change, finally invented a compromise in which Nemo's past is left mysterious. After this disagreement, Verne became notably cooler in his dealings with Hetzel, taking suggestions into consideration but often rejecting them outright.[76]\n\n\nFrom that point, Verne published two or more volumes a year. The most successful of these are: *Voyage au centre de la Terre* (*Journey to the Center of the Earth*, 1864); *De la Terre à la Lune* (*From the Earth to the Moon*, 1865); *Vingt mille lieues sous les mers* (*Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas*, 1869); and *Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours* (*Around the World in Eighty Days*), which first appeared in *Le Temps* in 1872. Verne could now live on his writings, but most of his wealth came from the stage adaptations of *Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours* (1874) and *Michel Strogoff* (1876), which he wrote with Adolphe d'Ennery.[77]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sketch by Verne of the *Saint-Michel*\nIn 1867, Verne bought a small boat, the *Saint-Michel*, which he successively replaced with the *Saint-Michel II* and the *Saint-Michel III* as his financial situation improved. On board the *Saint-Michel III*, he sailed around Europe. After his first novel, most of his stories were first serialised in the *Magazine d'Éducation et de Récréation*, a Hetzel biweekly publication, before being published in book form. His brother Paul contributed to *40th French climbing of the Mont-Blanc* and a collection of short stories – *Doctor Ox* – in 1874. Verne became wealthy and famous.[78]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Michel Verne married an actress against his father's wishes, had two children by an underage mistress and buried himself in debts.[79] The relationship between father and son improved as Michel grew older.[80]\n\n\n\n### Later years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jules Verne and Madame Verne c. 1900\nThough raised as a Roman Catholic, Verne gravitated towards deism.[81][82]\nSome scholars[*which?*] believe his novels reflect a deist philosophy, as they often involve the notion of God or divine providence but rarely mention the concept of Christ.[83][84]\n\n\nOn 9 March 1886, as Verne returned home, his twenty-six-year-old nephew, Gaston, shot at him twice with a pistol. The first bullet missed, but the second one entered Verne's left leg, giving him a permanent limp that could not be overcome. This incident was not publicised in the media, but Gaston spent the rest of his life in a mental asylum.[85]\n\n\nAfter the deaths of both his mother and Hetzel (who died in 1886), Jules Verne began publishing darker works. In 1888 he entered politics and was elected town councillor of Amiens, where he championed several improvements and served for fifteen years.[86]\n\n\nVerne was made a knight of France's Legion of Honour on 9 April 1870,[87] and subsequently promoted in Legion of Honour rank to Officer on 19 July 1892.[88]\n\n\n\n\n### Death and posthumous publications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Jules Verne's Tomb\n\n![](image)*The Lighthouse at the End of the World* is considered one of the best novels of Verne's literary stage.\nOn 24 March 1905, while ill with chronic diabetes and complications from a stroke which paralyzed his right side, Verne died at his home in Amiens,[89] 44 Boulevard Longueville (now Boulevard Jules-Verne). His son, Michel Verne, oversaw the publication of the novels *Invasion of the Sea* and *The Lighthouse at the End of the World* after Jules's death. The *Voyages extraordinaires* series continued for several years afterwards at the same rate of two volumes a year. It was later discovered that Michel Verne had made extensive changes in these stories,[3] and the original versions were eventually published at the end of the 20th century by the Jules Verne Society (Société Jules Verne). In 1919, Michel Verne published *The Barsac Mission* (French: *L'Étonnante Aventure de la Mission Barsac*), whose original drafts contained references to Esperanto,[90] a language that his father had been very interested in.[91][92]\n\n\nIn 1989, Verne's great-grandson discovered his ancestor's as-yet-unpublished novel *Paris in the Twentieth Century*, which was subsequently published in 1994.[93]\n\n\n\n* ![Jules Verne on his deathbed](image)\n\nJules Verne on his deathbed\n* ![Verne's funeral procession, headed by his son and grandson](image)\n\nVerne's funeral procession, headed by his son and grandson\n* ![Verne's tomb in Amiens](image)\n\nVerne's tomb in Amiens\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Jules Verne bibliography\n\n![](image)An 1889 Hetzel poster advertising Verne's works\n![](image)Verne novels, *The Carpathian Castle*, *The Danube Pilot*, *Claudius Bombarnac*, and *Kéraban the Inflexible*, on a miniature sheet of Romanian postage stamps (2005)\nVerne's largest body of work is the *Voyages extraordinaires* series, which includes all of his novels except for the two rejected manuscripts *Paris in the Twentieth Century* and *Backwards to Britain* (published posthumously in 1994 and 1989, respectively) and for projects left unfinished at his death (many of which would be posthumously adapted or rewritten for publication by his son Michel).[94] Verne also wrote many plays, poems, song texts, operetta libretti, and short stories, as well as a variety of essays and miscellaneous non-fiction.\n\n\n\n### Literary reception[edit]\n\n\nAfter his debut under Hetzel, Verne was enthusiastically received in France by writers and scientists alike, with George Sand and Théophile Gautier among his earliest admirers.[95] Several notable contemporary figures, from the geographer Vivien de Saint-Martin to the critic Jules Claretie, spoke highly of Verne and his works in critical and biographical notes.[96]\n\n\nHowever, Verne's growing popularity among readers and playgoers (due especially to the highly successful stage version of *Around the World in Eighty Days*) led to a gradual change in his literary reputation. As the novels and stage productions continued to sell, many contemporary critics felt that Verne's status as a commercially popular author meant he could only be seen as a mere genre-based storyteller, rather than a serious author worthy of academic study.[97]\n\n\nThis denial of formal literary status took various forms, including dismissive criticism by such writers as Émile Zola and the lack of Verne's nomination for membership in the Académie Française,[97] and was recognized by Verne himself, who said in a late interview: \"The great regret of my life is that I have never taken any place in French literature.\"[98] To Verne, who considered himself \"a man of letters and an artist, living in the pursuit of the ideal\",[99] this critical dismissal on the basis of literary ideology could only be seen as the ultimate snub.[100]\n\n\nThis bifurcation of Verne as a popular genre writer but a critical *persona non grata* continued after his death, with early biographies (including one by Verne's own niece, Marguerite Allotte de la Fuÿe) focusing on error-filled and embroidered hagiography of Verne as a popular figure rather than on Verne's actual working methods or his output.[101] Meanwhile, sales of Verne's novels in their original unabridged versions dropped markedly even in Verne's home country, with abridged versions aimed directly at children taking their place.[102]\n\n\nHowever, the decades after Verne's death also saw the rise in France of the \"Jules Verne cult\", a steadily growing group of scholars and young writers who took Verne's works seriously as literature and willingly noted his influence on their own pioneering works. Some of the cult founded the Société Jules Verne, the first academic society for Verne scholars; many others became highly respected *avant garde* and surrealist literary figures in their own right. Their praise and analyses, emphasizing Verne's stylistic innovations and enduring literary themes, proved highly influential for literary studies to come.[103]\n\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, thanks in large part to a sustained wave of serious literary study from well-known French scholars and writers, Verne's reputation skyrocketed in France.[104][105] Roland Barthes' seminal essay *Nautilus et Bateau Ivre* (*The Nautilus and the Drunken Boat*) was influential in its exegesis of the *Voyages extraordinares* as a purely literary text, while book-length studies by such figures as Marcel Moré and Jean Chesneaux considered Verne from a multitude of thematic vantage points.[106]\n\n\nFrench literary journals devoted entire issues to Verne and his work, with essays by such imposing literary figures as Michel Butor, Georges Borgeaud, Marcel Brion, Pierre Versins, Michel Foucault, René Barjavel, Marcel Lecomte, Francis Lacassin, and Michel Serres; meanwhile, Verne's entire published opus returned to print, with unabridged and illustrated editions of his works printed by Livre de Poche and Éditions Rencontre.[107] The wave reached its climax in Verne's sesquicentennial year 1978, when he was made the subject of an academic colloquium at the Centre culturel international de Cerisy-la-Salle, and *Journey to the Center of the Earth* was accepted for the French university system's *agrégation* reading list. Since these events, Verne has been consistently recognized in Europe as a legitimate member of the French literary canon, with academic studies and new publications steadily continuing.[108]\n\n\nVerne's reputation in English-speaking countries has been considerably slower in changing. Throughout the 20th century, most anglophone scholars dismissed Verne as a genre writer for children and a naïve proponent of science and technology (despite strong evidence to the contrary on both counts), thus finding him more interesting as a technological \"prophet\" or as a subject of comparison to English-language writers such as Edgar Allan Poe and H. G. Wells than as a topic of literary study in his own right. This narrow view of Verne has undoubtedly been influenced by the poor-quality English translations and very loosely adapted Hollywood film versions through which most American and British readers have discovered Verne.[5][109] However, since the mid-1980s a considerable number of serious English-language studies and translations have appeared, suggesting that a rehabilitation of Verne's anglophone reputation may currently be underway.[110][111]\n\n\n\n### English translations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An early edition of the notorious Griffith & Farran adaptation of *Journey to the Center of the Earth*\nTranslation of Verne into English began in 1852, when Verne's short story *A Voyage in a Balloon* (1851) was published in the American journal *Sartain's Union Magazine of Literature and Art* in a translation by Anne T. Wilbur.[112] Translation of his novels began in 1869 with William Lackland's translation of *Five Weeks in a Balloon* (originally published in 1863),[113] and continued steadily throughout Verne's lifetime, with publishers and hired translators often working in great haste to rush his most lucrative titles into English-language print.[114] Unlike Hetzel, who targeted all ages with his publishing strategies for the *Voyages extraordinaires*, the British and American publishers of Verne chose to market his books almost exclusively to young audiences; this business move, with its implication that Verne could be treated purely as a children's author, had a long-lasting effect on Verne's reputation in English-speaking countries.[110][115]\n\n\nThese early English-language translations have been widely criticized for their extensive textual omissions, errors, and alterations, and are not considered adequate representations of Verne's actual novels.[114][116][117] In an essay for *The Guardian*, British writer Adam Roberts commented: \"I'd always liked reading Jules Verne and I've read most of his novels; but it wasn't until recently that I really understood I hadn't been reading Jules Verne at all ... It's a bizarre situation for a world-famous writer to be in. Indeed, I can't think of a major writer who has been so poorly served by translation.\"[116]\n\n\nSimilarly, the American novelist Michael Crichton observed:\n\n\n\n\n> Verne's prose is lean and fast-moving in a peculiarly modern way ... [but] Verne has been particularly ill-served by his English translators. At best they have provided us with clunky, choppy, tone-deaf prose. At worst – as in the notorious 1872 \"translation\" [of *Journey to the Center of the Earth*] published by Griffith & Farran – they have blithely altered the text, giving Verne's characters new names, and adding whole pages of their own invention, thus effectively obliterating the meaning and tone of Verne's original.[117]\n> \n> \n\n\nSince 1965, a considerable number of more accurate English translations of Verne have appeared. However, the older, deficient translations continue to be republished due to their public domain status, and in many cases their easy availability in online sources.[110]\n\n\n\n### Relationship with science fiction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Caricature of Verne with fantastic sea life (1884)\nThe relationship between Verne's *Voyages extraordinaires* and the literary genre science fiction is a complex one. Verne, like H. G. Wells, is frequently cited as one of the founders of the genre, and his profound influence on its development is indisputable; however, many earlier writers, such as Lucian of Samosata, Voltaire, and Mary Shelley, have also been cited as creators of science fiction, an unavoidable ambiguity arising from the vague definition and history of the genre.[7]\n\n\nA primary issue at the heart of the dispute is the question of whether Verne's works count as science fiction to begin with. Maurice Renard claimed that Verne \"never wrote a single sentence of scientific-marvelous\".[118] Verne himself argued repeatedly in interviews that his novels were not meant to be read as scientific, saying \"I have invented nothing\".[119] His own goal was rather to \"depict the earth [and] at the same time to realize a very high ideal of beauty of style\",[71] as he pointed out in an example:\n\n\n\n\n> I wrote *Five Weeks in a Balloon*, not as a story about ballooning, but as a story about Africa. I always was greatly interested in geography, history and travel, and I wanted to give a romantic description of Africa. Now, there was no means of taking my travellers through Africa otherwise than in a balloon, and that is why a balloon is introduced.… I may say that at the time I wrote the novel, as now, I had no faith in the possibility of ever steering balloons…[71]\n> \n> \n\n\nClosely related to Verne's science-fiction reputation is the often-repeated claim that he is a \"prophet\" of scientific progress, and that many of his novels involve elements of technology that were fantastic for his day but later became commonplace.[120] These claims have a long history, especially in America, but the modern scholarly consensus is that such claims of prophecy are heavily exaggerated.[121] In a 1961 article critical of *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas*' scientific accuracy, Theodore L. Thomas speculated that Verne's storytelling skill and readers' faulty memories of a book they read as children caused people to \"remember things from it that are not there. The impression that the novel contains valid scientific prediction seems to grow as the years roll by\".[122] As with science fiction, Verne himself flatly denied that he was a futuristic prophet, saying that any connection between scientific developments and his work was \"mere coincidence\" and attributing his indisputable scientific accuracy to his extensive research: \"even before I began writing stories, I always took numerous notes out of every book, newspaper, magazine, or scientific report that I came across.\"[123]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cultural influence of Jules Verne\n\n![](image)Monument to Verne in Redondela, Spain\nVerne's novels have had a wide influence on both literary and scientific works; writers known to have been influenced by Verne include Marcel Aymé, Roland Barthes, René Barjavel, Michel Butor, Blaise Cendrars, Paul Claudel, Jean Cocteau, Julio Cortázar, François Mauriac, Rick Riordan, Raymond Roussel, Claude Roy, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, and Jean-Paul Sartre,[124] while scientists and explorers who acknowledged Verne's inspiration have included Richard E. Byrd, Yuri Gagarin, Simon Lake, Hubert Lyautey, Guglielmo Marconi, Fridtjof Nansen, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Wernher von Braun,[109] and Jack Parsons.[125] Verne is credited with helping inspire the steampunk genre, a literary and social movement that glamorizes science fiction based on 19th-century technology.[126][127]\n\n\nRay Bradbury summarized Verne's influence on literature and science the world over by saying: \"We are all, in one way or another, the children of Jules Verne.\"[128]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n\n\n* Legion of Honour\n* List of Legion of Honour recipients by name (V)\n* Legion of Honour Museum\n* Scientific Marvelous\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** These six, and most of Verne's novels, were published in the Voyages extraordinaires series.\n2. **^** Jules-Verne 1976, p. 1: \"On his mother's side, Verne is known to be descended from one 'N.

His collaboration with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel led to the creation of the *Voyages extraordinaires*,[3] a series of bestselling adventure novels including *Journey to the Center of the Earth* (1864), *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas* (1870), and *Around the World in Eighty Days* (1872). His novels, always well documented, are generally set in the second half of the 19th century, taking into account the technological advances of the time.\n\n\nIn addition to his novels, he wrote numerous plays, short stories, autobiographical accounts, poetry, songs, and scientific, artistic, and literary studies. His work has been adapted for film and television since the beginning of cinema, as well as for comic books, theater, opera, music and video games.\n\n\nVerne is considered to be an important author in France and most of Europe, where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism.[4] His reputation was markedly different in the Anglosphere where he had often been labeled a writer of genre fiction or children's books, largely because of the highly abridged and altered translations in which his novels have often been printed. Since the 1980s, his literary reputation has improved.[5]\n\n\nJules Verne has been the second most-translated author in the world since 1979, ranking below Agatha Christie and above William Shakespeare.[6] He has sometimes been called the \"father of science fiction\", a title that has also been given to H. G. Wells and Hugo Gernsback.[7] In the 2010s, he was the most translated French author in the world. In France, 2005 was declared \"Jules Verne Year\" on the occasion of the centenary of the writer's death.\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nantes from Île Feydeau, around the time of Verne's birth\nVerne was born on 8 February 1828, on Île Feydeau, a then small artificial island on the river Loire within the town of Nantes (later filled-in and incorporated into the surrounding land-area), in No. 4 Rue Olivier-de-Clisson, the house of his maternal grandmother Dame Sophie Marie Adélaïde Julienne Allotte de La Fuÿe (born Guillochet de La Perrière).[8] His parents were Pierre Verne, an attorney originally from Provins, and Sophie Allotte de La Fuÿe, a Nantes woman from a local family of navigators and shipowners, of distant Scottish descent.[9][b] In 1829, the Verne family moved some hundred metres away to No. 2 Quai Jean-Bart, where Verne's brother Paul was born the same year. Three sisters, Anne \"Anna\" (1836), Mathilde (1839), and Marie (1842) would follow.[9]\n\n\nIn 1834, at the age of six, Verne was sent to boarding school at 5 Place du Bouffay in Nantes. The teacher, Madame Sambin, was the widow of a naval captain who had disappeared some 30 years before.[10] Madame Sambin often told the students that her husband was a shipwrecked castaway and that he would eventually return like Robinson Crusoe from his desert island paradise.[11] The theme of the robinsonade would stay with Verne throughout his life and appear in many of his novels, some of which include *The Mysterious Island* (1874), *Second Fatherland* (1900), and *The School for Robinsons* (1882).\n\n\nIn 1836, Verne went on to École Saint‑Stanislas, a Catholic school suiting the pious religious tastes of his father. Verne quickly distinguished himself in *mémoire* (recitation from memory), geography, Greek, Latin, and singing.[12] In the same year, 1836, Pierre Verne bought a vacation house at 29 Rue des Réformés in the village of Chantenay (now part of Nantes) on the Loire.[13] In his brief memoir *Souvenirs d'enfance et de jeunesse* (*Memories of Childhood and Youth*, 1890), Verne recalled a deep fascination with the river and with the many merchant vessels navigating it.[14] He also took vacations at Brains, in the house of his uncle Prudent Allotte, a retired shipowner, who had gone around the world and served as mayor of Brains from 1828 to 1837. Verne took joy in playing interminable rounds of the Game of the Goose with his uncle, and both the game and his uncle's name would be memorialized in two late novels (*The Will of an Eccentric* (1900) and *Robur the Conqueror* (1886), respectively).[14][15]\n\n\nLegend has it that in 1839, at the age of 11, Verne secretly procured a spot as cabin boy on the three-mast ship *Coralie* with the intention of traveling to the Indies and bringing back a coral necklace for his cousin Caroline. The evening the ship set out for the Indies, it stopped first at Paimboeuf where Pierre Verne arrived just in time to catch his son and make him promise to travel \"only in his imagination\".[16] It is now known that the legend is an exaggerated tale invented by Verne's first biographer, his niece Marguerite Allotte de la Füye, though it may have been inspired by a real incident.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Lycée Royal in Nantes (now the Georges-Clemenceau), where Verne studied\nIn 1840, the Vernes moved again to a large apartment at No. 6 Rue Jean-Jacques-Rousseau, where the family's youngest child, Marie, was born in 1842.[13] In the same year Verne entered another religious school, the Petit Séminaire de Saint-Donatien, as a lay student. His unfinished novel *Un prêtre en 1839* (*A Priest in 1839*), written in his teens and the earliest of his prose works to survive,[18] describes the seminary in disparaging terms.[12] From 1844 to 1846, Verne and his brother were enrolled in the Lycée Royal (now the Lycée Georges-Clemenceau) in Nantes. After finishing classes in rhetoric and philosophy, he took the baccalauréat at Rennes and received the grade \"Good Enough\" on 29 July 1846.[19]\n\n\nBy 1847, when Verne was 19, he had taken seriously to writing long works in the style of Victor Hugo, beginning *Un prêtre en 1839* and seeing two verse tragedies, *Alexandre VI* and *La Conspiration des poudres* (*The Gunpowder Plot*), to completion.[18] However, his father took it for granted that Verne, being the firstborn son of the family, would not attempt to make money in literature but would instead inherit the family law practice.[20]\n\n\nIn 1847, Verne's father sent him to Paris, primarily to begin his studies in law school, and secondarily (according to family legend) to distance him temporarily from Nantes.[21][22] His cousin Caroline, with whom he was in love, was married on 27 April 1847, to Émile Dezaunay, a man of 40, with whom she would have five children.[23]\n\n\nAfter a short stay in Paris, where he passed first-year law exams, Verne returned to Nantes for his father's help in preparing for the second year. (Provincial law students were in that era required to go to Paris to take exams.)[24] While in Nantes, he met Rose Herminie Arnaud Grossetière, a young woman one year his senior, and fell intensely in love with her. He wrote and dedicated some thirty poems to her, including *La Fille de l'air* (*The Daughter of Air*), which describes her as \"blonde and enchanting / winged and transparent\".[25] His passion seems to have been reciprocated, at least for a short time,[22] but Grossetière's parents frowned upon the idea of their daughter marrying a young student of uncertain future. They married her instead to Armand Terrien de la Haye, a rich landowner ten years her senior, on 19 July 1848.[26]\n\n\nThe sudden marriage sent Verne into deep frustration. He wrote a hallucinatory letter to his mother, apparently composed in a state of half-drunkenness, in which under pretext of a dream he described his misery.[27] This requited but aborted love affair seems to have permanently marked the author and his work, and his novels include a significant number of young women married against their will (Gérande in *Master Zacharius* (1854), Sava in *Mathias Sandorf* (1885), Ellen in *A Floating City* (1871), etc.), to such an extent that the scholar Christian Chelebourg attributed the recurring theme to a \"Herminie complex\".[28] The incident also led Verne to bear a grudge against his birthplace and Nantes society, which he criticized in his poem *La sixième ville de France* (*The Sixth City of France*).[29][30]\n\n\n\n### Studies in Paris[edit]\n\n\nIn July 1848, Verne left Nantes again for Paris, where his father intended him to finish law studies and take up law as a profession. He obtained permission from his father to rent a furnished apartment at 24 Rue de l'Ancienne-Comédie, which he shared with Édouard Bonamy, another student of Nantes origin.[27] (On his 1847 Paris visit, Verne had stayed at 2 Rue Thérèse, the house of his aunt Charuel, on the Butte Saint-Roch.)[31]\n\n\nVerne arrived in Paris during a time of political upheaval: the French Revolution of 1848. In February, Louis Philippe I had been overthrown and had fled; on 24 February, a provisional government of the French Second Republic took power, but political demonstrations continued, and social tension remained. In June, barricades went up in Paris, and the government sent Louis-Eugène Cavaignac to crush the insurrection. Verne entered the city shortly before the election of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte as the first president of the Republic, a state of affairs that would last until the French coup of 1851. In a letter to his family, Verne described the bombarded state of the city after the recent June Days uprising but assured them that the anniversary of Bastille Day had gone by without any significant conflict.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)Aristide Hignard\nVerne used his family connections to make an entrance into Paris society. His uncle Francisque de Chatêaubourg introduced him into literary salons, and Verne particularly frequented those of Mme de Barrère, a friend of his mother's.[33] While continuing his law studies, he fed his passion for the theater, writing numerous plays. Verne later recalled: \"I was greatly under the influence of Victor Hugo, indeed, very excited by reading and re-reading his works. At that time I could have recited by heart whole pages of *Notre Dame de Paris*, but it was his dramatic work that most influenced me.\"[34] Another source of creative stimulation came from a neighbor: living on the same floor in the Rue de l'Ancienne-Comédie apartment house was a young composer, Aristide Hignard, with whom Verne soon became good friends, and Verne wrote several texts for Hignard to set as chansons.[35]\n\n\nDuring this period, Verne's letters to his parents primarily focused on expenses and on a suddenly appearing series of violent stomach cramps,[36] the first of many he would suffer from during his life. (Modern scholars have hypothesized that he suffered from colitis;[36] Verne believed the illness to have been inherited from his mother's side.[37]) Rumors of an outbreak of cholera in March 1849 exacerbated these medical concerns.[36] Yet another health problem would strike in 1851 when Verne suffered the first of four attacks of facial paralysis. These attacks, rather than being psychosomatic, were due to an inflammation in the middle ear, though this cause remained unknown to Verne during his life.[38]\n\n\nIn the same year, Verne was required to enlist in the French army, but the sortition process spared him, to his great relief. He wrote to his father: \"You should already know, dear papa, what I think of the military life, and of these domestic servants in livery. … You have to abandon all dignity to perform such functions.\"[39] Verne's strong antiwar sentiments, to the dismay of his father, would remain steadfast throughout his life.[39]\n\n\nThough writing profusely and frequenting the salons, Verne diligently pursued his law studies and graduated with a *licence en droit* in January 1851.[40]\n\n\n\n### Literary debut[edit]\n\n\nThanks to his visits to salons, Verne came into contact in 1849 with Alexandre Dumas through the mutual acquaintance of a celebrated chirologist of the time, the Chevalier d'Arpentigny.[40] Verne became close friends with Dumas' son, Alexandre Dumas fils, and showed him a manuscript for a stage comedy, *Les Pailles rompues* (*The Broken Straws*). The two young men revised the play together, and Dumas, through arrangements with his father, had it produced by the Opéra-National at the Théâtre Historique in Paris, opening on 12 June 1850.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cover of an 1854–55 issue of *Musée des familles*\nIn 1851, Verne met with a fellow writer from Nantes, Pierre-Michel-François Chevalier (known as \"Pitre-Chevalier\"), the editor-in-chief of the magazine *Musée des familles* (*The Family Museum*).[42] Pitre-Chevalier was looking for articles about geography, history, science, and technology, and was keen to make sure that the educational component would be made accessible to large popular audiences using a straightforward prose style or an engaging fictional story. Verne, with his delight in diligent research, especially in geography, was a natural for the job.[43] Verne first offered him a short historical adventure story, *The First Ships of the Mexican Navy*, written in the style of James Fenimore Cooper, whose novels had deeply influenced him.[42] Pitre-Chevalier published it in July 1851, and in the same year published a second short story by Verne, *A Voyage in a Balloon* (August 1851). The latter story, with its combination of adventurous narrative, travel themes, and detailed historical research, would later be described by Verne as \"the first indication of the line of novel that I was destined to follow\".[34]\n\n\nDumas fils put Verne in contact with Jules Seveste, a stage director who had taken over the directorship of the Théâtre Historique and renamed it the Théâtre Lyrique. Seveste offered Verne the job of secretary of the theater, with little or no salary attached.[9] Verne accepted, using the opportunity to write and produce several comic operas written in collaboration with Hignard and the prolific librettist Michel Carré.[44] To celebrate his employment at the Théâtre Lyrique, Verne joined with ten friends to found a bachelors' dining club, the *Onze-sans-femme* (*Eleven Bachelors*).[45]\n\n\nFor some time, Verne's father pressed him to abandon his writing and begin a business as a lawyer. However, Verne argued in his letters that he could only find success in literature.[46] The pressure to plan for a secure future in law reached its climax in January 1852, when his father offered Verne his own Nantes law practice.[47] Faced with this ultimatum, Verne decided conclusively to continue his literary life and refuse the job, writing: \"Am I not right to follow my own instincts? It's because I know who I am that I realize what I can be one day.\"[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jacques Arago\nMeanwhile, Verne was spending much time at the Bibliothèque nationale de France, conducting research for his stories and feeding his passion for science and recent discoveries, especially in geography. It was in this period that Verne met the illustrious geographer and explorer Jacques Arago, who continued to travel extensively despite his blindness (he had lost his sight completely in 1837). The two men became good friends, and Arago's innovative and witty accounts of his travels led Verne toward a newly developing genre of literature: that of travel writing.[49][50]\n\n\nIn 1852, two new pieces from Verne appeared in the *Musée des familles*: *Martin Paz*, a novella set in Lima, which Verne wrote in 1851 and published 10 July through 11 August 1852, and *Les Châteaux en Californie, ou, Pierre qui roule n'amasse pas mousse* (*The Castles in California, or, A Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss*), a one-act comedy full of racy double entendres.[51] In April and May 1854, the magazine published Verne's short story *Master Zacharius*, an E. T. A. Hoffmann-like fantasy featuring a sharp condemnation of scientific hubris and ambition,[52] followed soon afterward by *A Winter Amid the Ice*, a polar adventure story whose themes closely anticipated many of Verne's novels.[53] The *Musée* also published some nonfiction popular science articles which, though unsigned, are generally attributed to Verne.[43] Verne's work for the magazine was cut short in 1856 when he had a serious quarrel with Pitre-Chevalier and refused to continue contributing (a refusal he would maintain until 1863, when Pitre-Chevalier died, and the magazine went to new editorship).[54]\n\n\nWhile writing stories and articles for Pitre-Chevalier, Verne began to form the idea of inventing a new kind of novel, a \"Roman de la Science\" (\"novel of science\"), which would allow him to incorporate large amounts of the factual information he so enjoyed researching in the Bibliothèque. He is said to have discussed the project with the elder Alexandre Dumas, who had tried something similar with an unfinished novel, *Isaac Laquedem*, and who enthusiastically encouraged Verne's project.[55]\n\n\nAt the end of 1854, another outbreak of cholera led to the death of Jules Seveste, Verne's employer at the Théâtre Lyrique and by then a good friend.[53] Though his contract only held him to a further year of service, Verne remained connected to the theater for several years after Seveste's death, seeing additional productions to fruition.[56] He also continued to write plays and musical comedies, most of which were not performed.[54]\n\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\nIn May 1856, Verne traveled to Amiens to be the best man at the wedding of a Nantes friend, Auguste Lelarge, to an Amiens woman named Aimée du Fraysne de Viane. Verne, invited to stay with the bride's family, took to them warmly, befriending the entire household and finding himself increasingly attracted to the bride's sister, Honorine Anne Hébée Morel (née du Fraysne de Viane), a widow aged 26 with two young children.[57][58] Hoping to find a secure source of income, as well as a chance to court Morel in earnest, he jumped at her brother's offer to go into business with a broker.[59] Verne's father was initially dubious but gave in to his son's requests for approval in November 1856. With his financial situation finally looking promising, Verne won the favor of Morel and her family, and the couple were married on 10 January 1857.[60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jules Verne Museum, Butte Saint-Anne, Nantes, France\nVerne plunged into his new business obligations, leaving his work at the Théâtre Lyrique and taking up a full-time job as an *agent de change*[54] on the Paris Bourse, where he became the associate of the broker Fernand Eggly.[61] Verne woke up early each morning so that he would have time to write, before going to the Bourse for the day's work; in the rest of his spare time, he continued to consort with the *Onze-Sans-Femme* club (all eleven of its \"bachelors\" had by this time married). He also continued to frequent the Bibliothèque to do scientific and historical research, much of which he copied onto notecards for future use—a system he would continue for the rest of his life.[54] According to the recollections of a colleague, Verne \"did better in repartee than in business\".[61]\n\n\nIn July 1858, Verne and Aristide Hignard seized an opportunity offered by Hignard's brother: a sea voyage, at no charge, from Bordeaux to Liverpool and Scotland. The journey, Verne's first trip outside France, deeply impressed him, and upon his return to Paris he fictionalized his recollections to form the backbone of a semi-autobiographical novel, *Backwards to Britain* (written in the autumn and winter of 1859–1860 and not published until 1989).[62] A second complimentary voyage in 1861 took Hignard and Verne to Stockholm, from where they traveled to Christiania and through Telemark.[63] Verne left Hignard in Denmark to return in haste to Paris, but missed the birth on 3 August 1861 of his only biological son, Michel.[64]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Verne continued work on the idea of a \"Roman de la Science\", which he developed in a rough draft, inspired, according to his recollections, by his \"love for maps and the great explorers of the world\". It took shape as a story of travel across Africa and would eventually become his first published novel, *Five Weeks in a Balloon*.[54]\n\n\n\n### Hetzel[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pierre-Jules Hetzel\nIn 1862, through their mutual acquaintance Alfred de Bréhat, Verne came into contact with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, and submitted to him the manuscript of his developing novel, then called *Voyage en Ballon*.[65] Hetzel, already the publisher of Honoré de Balzac, George Sand, Victor Hugo, and other well-known authors, had long been planning to launch a high-quality family magazine in which entertaining fiction would combine with scientific education.[66] He saw Verne, with his demonstrated inclination toward scrupulously researched adventure stories, as an ideal contributor for such a magazine, and accepted the novel, giving Verne suggestions for improvement. Verne made the proposed revisions within two weeks and returned to Hetzel with the final draft, now titled *Five Weeks in a Balloon*.[67] It was published by Hetzel on 31 January 1863.[68]\n\n\nTo secure his services for the planned magazine, to be called the *Magasin d'Éducation et de Récréation* (*Magazine of Education and Recreation*), Hetzel also drew up a long-term contract in which Verne would give him three volumes of text per year, each of which Hetzel would buy outright for a flat fee. Verne, finding both a steady salary and a sure outlet for writing at last, accepted immediately.[69] For the rest of his lifetime, most of his novels would be serialized in Hetzel's *Magasin* before their appearance in book form, beginning with his second novel for Hetzel, *The Adventures of Captain Hatteras* (1864–65).[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Hetzel edition of Verne's *The Adventures of Captain Hatteras* (cover style \"Aux deux éléphants\")\nWhen *The Adventures of Captain Hatteras* was published in book form in 1866, Hetzel publicly announced his literary and educational ambitions for Verne's novels by saying in a preface that Verne's works would form a novel sequence called the *Voyages extraordinaires* (*Extraordinary Voyages* or *Extraordinary Journeys*), and that Verne's aim was \"to outline all the geographical, geological, physical, and astronomical knowledge amassed by modern science and to recount, in an entertaining and picturesque format that is his own, the history of the universe\".[70] Late in life, Verne confirmed that this commission had become the running theme of his novels: \"My object has been to depict the earth, and not the earth alone, but the universe… And I have tried at the same time to realize a very high ideal of beauty of style. It is said that there can't be any style in a novel of adventure, but it isn't true.\"[71] However, he also noted that the project was extremely ambitious: \"Yes! But the Earth is very large, and life is very short! In order to leave a completed work behind, one would need to live to be at least 100 years old!\"[72]\n\n\nHetzel influenced many of Verne's novels directly, especially in the first few years of their collaboration, for Verne was initially so happy to find a publisher that he agreed to almost all of the changes Hetzel suggested. For example, when Hetzel disapproved of the original climax of *Captain Hatteras*, including the death of the title character, Verne wrote an entirely new conclusion in which Hatteras survived.[73] Hetzel also rejected Verne's next submission, *Paris in the Twentieth Century*, believing its pessimistic view of the future and its condemnation of technological progress were too subversive for a family magazine.[74] (The manuscript, believed lost for some time after Verne's death, was finally published in 1994.)[75]\n\n\nThe relationship between publisher and writer changed significantly around 1869 when Verne and Hetzel were brought into conflict over the manuscript for *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas*. Verne had initially conceived of the submariner Captain Nemo as a Polish scientist whose acts of vengeance were directed against the Russians who had killed his family during the January Uprising. Hetzel, not wanting to alienate the lucrative Russian market for Verne's books, demanded that Nemo be made an enemy of the slave trade, a situation that would make him an unambiguous hero. Verne, after fighting vehemently against the change, finally invented a compromise in which Nemo's past is left mysterious. After this disagreement, Verne became notably cooler in his dealings with Hetzel, taking suggestions into consideration but often rejecting them outright.[76]\n\n\nFrom that point, Verne published two or more volumes a year. The most successful of these are: *Voyage au centre de la Terre* (*Journey to the Center of the Earth*, 1864); *De la Terre à la Lune* (*From the Earth to the Moon*, 1865); *Vingt mille lieues sous les mers* (*Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas*, 1869); and *Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours* (*Around the World in Eighty Days*), which first appeared in *Le Temps* in 1872. Verne could now live on his writings, but most of his wealth came from the stage adaptations of *Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours* (1874) and *Michel Strogoff* (1876), which he wrote with Adolphe d'Ennery.[77]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sketch by Verne of the *Saint-Michel*\nIn 1867, Verne bought a small boat, the *Saint-Michel*, which he successively replaced with the *Saint-Michel II* and the *Saint-Michel III* as his financial situation improved. On board the *Saint-Michel III*, he sailed around Europe. After his first novel, most of his stories were first serialised in the *Magazine d'Éducation et de Récréation*, a Hetzel biweekly publication, before being published in book form. His brother Paul contributed to *40th French climbing of the Mont-Blanc* and a collection of short stories – *Doctor Ox* – in 1874. Verne became wealthy and famous.[78]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Michel Verne married an actress against his father's wishes, had two children by an underage mistress and buried himself in debts.[79] The relationship between father and son improved as Michel grew older.[80]\n\n\n\n### Later years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jules Verne and Madame Verne c. 1900\nThough raised as a Roman Catholic, Verne gravitated towards deism.[81][82]\nSome scholars[*which?*] believe his novels reflect a deist philosophy, as they often involve the notion of God or divine providence but rarely mention the concept of Christ.[83][84]\n\n\nOn 9 March 1886, as Verne returned home, his twenty-six-year-old nephew, Gaston, shot at him twice with a pistol. The first bullet missed, but the second one entered Verne's left leg, giving him a permanent limp that could not be overcome. This incident was not publicised in the media, but Gaston spent the rest of his life in a mental asylum.[85]\n\n\nAfter the deaths of both his mother and Hetzel (who died in 1886), Jules Verne began publishing darker works. In 1888 he entered politics and was elected town councillor of Amiens, where he championed several improvements and served for fifteen years.[86]\n\n\nVerne was made a knight of France's Legion of Honour on 9 April 1870,[87] and subsequently promoted in Legion of Honour rank to Officer on 19 July 1892.[88]\n\n\n\n\n### Death and posthumous publications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Jules Verne's Tomb\n\n![](image)*The Lighthouse at the End of the World* is considered one of the best novels of Verne's literary stage.\nOn 24 March 1905, while ill with chronic diabetes and complications from a stroke which paralyzed his right side, Verne died at his home in Amiens,[89] 44 Boulevard Longueville (now Boulevard Jules-Verne). His son, Michel Verne, oversaw the publication of the novels *Invasion of the Sea* and *The Lighthouse at the End of the World* after Jules's death. The *Voyages extraordinaires* series continued for several years afterwards at the same rate of two volumes a year. It was later discovered that Michel Verne had made extensive changes in these stories,[3] and the original versions were eventually published at the end of the 20th century by the Jules Verne Society (Société Jules Verne). In 1919, Michel Verne published *The Barsac Mission* (French: *L'Étonnante Aventure de la Mission Barsac*), whose original drafts contained references to Esperanto,[90] a language that his father had been very interested in.[91][92]\n\n\nIn 1989, Verne's great-grandson discovered his ancestor's as-yet-unpublished novel *Paris in the Twentieth Century*, which was subsequently published in 1994.[93]\n\n\n\n* ![Jules Verne on his deathbed](image)\n\nJules Verne on his deathbed\n* ![Verne's funeral procession, headed by his son and grandson](image)\n\nVerne's funeral procession, headed by his son and grandson\n* ![Verne's tomb in Amiens](image)\n\nVerne's tomb in Amiens\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Jules Verne bibliography\n\n![](image)An 1889 Hetzel poster advertising Verne's works\n![](image)Verne novels, *The Carpathian Castle*, *The Danube Pilot*, *Claudius Bombarnac*, and *Kéraban the Inflexible*, on a miniature sheet of Romanian postage stamps (2005)\nVerne's largest body of work is the *Voyages extraordinaires* series, which includes all of his novels except for the two rejected manuscripts *Paris in the Twentieth Century* and *Backwards to Britain* (published posthumously in 1994 and 1989, respectively) and for projects left unfinished at his death (many of which would be posthumously adapted or rewritten for publication by his son Michel).[94] Verne also wrote many plays, poems, song texts, operetta libretti, and short stories, as well as a variety of essays and miscellaneous non-fiction.\n\n\n\n### Literary reception[edit]\n\n\nAfter his debut under Hetzel, Verne was enthusiastically received in France by writers and scientists alike, with George Sand and Théophile Gautier among his earliest admirers.[95] Several notable contemporary figures, from the geographer Vivien de Saint-Martin to the critic Jules Claretie, spoke highly of Verne and his works in critical and biographical notes.[96]\n\n\nHowever, Verne's growing popularity among readers and playgoers (due especially to the highly successful stage version of *Around the World in Eighty Days*) led to a gradual change in his literary reputation. As the novels and stage productions continued to sell, many contemporary critics felt that Verne's status as a commercially popular author meant he could only be seen as a mere genre-based storyteller, rather than a serious author worthy of academic study.[97]\n\n\nThis denial of formal literary status took various forms, including dismissive criticism by such writers as Émile Zola and the lack of Verne's nomination for membership in the Académie Française,[97] and was recognized by Verne himself, who said in a late interview: \"The great regret of my life is that I have never taken any place in French literature.\"[98] To Verne, who considered himself \"a man of letters and an artist, living in the pursuit of the ideal\",[99] this critical dismissal on the basis of literary ideology could only be seen as the ultimate snub.[100]\n\n\nThis bifurcation of Verne as a popular genre writer but a critical *persona non grata* continued after his death, with early biographies (including one by Verne's own niece, Marguerite Allotte de la Fuÿe) focusing on error-filled and embroidered hagiography of Verne as a popular figure rather than on Verne's actual working methods or his output.[101] Meanwhile, sales of Verne's novels in their original unabridged versions dropped markedly even in Verne's home country, with abridged versions aimed directly at children taking their place.[102]\n\n\nHowever, the decades after Verne's death also saw the rise in France of the \"Jules Verne cult\", a steadily growing group of scholars and young writers who took Verne's works seriously as literature and willingly noted his influence on their own pioneering works. Some of the cult founded the Société Jules Verne, the first academic society for Verne scholars; many others became highly respected *avant garde* and surrealist literary figures in their own right. Their praise and analyses, emphasizing Verne's stylistic innovations and enduring literary themes, proved highly influential for literary studies to come.[103]\n\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, thanks in large part to a sustained wave of serious literary study from well-known French scholars and writers, Verne's reputation skyrocketed in France.[104][105] Roland Barthes' seminal essay *Nautilus et Bateau Ivre* (*The Nautilus and the Drunken Boat*) was influential in its exegesis of the *Voyages extraordinares* as a purely literary text, while book-length studies by such figures as Marcel Moré and Jean Chesneaux considered Verne from a multitude of thematic vantage points.[106]\n\n\nFrench literary journals devoted entire issues to Verne and his work, with essays by such imposing literary figures as Michel Butor, Georges Borgeaud, Marcel Brion, Pierre Versins, Michel Foucault, René Barjavel, Marcel Lecomte, Francis Lacassin, and Michel Serres; meanwhile, Verne's entire published opus returned to print, with unabridged and illustrated editions of his works printed by Livre de Poche and Éditions Rencontre.[107] The wave reached its climax in Verne's sesquicentennial year 1978, when he was made the subject of an academic colloquium at the Centre culturel international de Cerisy-la-Salle, and *Journey to the Center of the Earth* was accepted for the French university system's *agrégation* reading list. Since these events, Verne has been consistently recognized in Europe as a legitimate member of the French literary canon, with academic studies and new publications steadily continuing.[108]\n\n\nVerne's reputation in English-speaking countries has been considerably slower in changing. Throughout the 20th century, most anglophone scholars dismissed Verne as a genre writer for children and a naïve proponent of science and technology (despite strong evidence to the contrary on both counts), thus finding him more interesting as a technological \"prophet\" or as a subject of comparison to English-language writers such as Edgar Allan Poe and H. G. Wells than as a topic of literary study in his own right. This narrow view of Verne has undoubtedly been influenced by the poor-quality English translations and very loosely adapted Hollywood film versions through which most American and British readers have discovered Verne.[5][109] However, since the mid-1980s a considerable number of serious English-language studies and translations have appeared, suggesting that a rehabilitation of Verne's anglophone reputation may currently be underway.[110][111]\n\n\n\n### English translations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An early edition of the notorious Griffith & Farran adaptation of *Journey to the Center of the Earth*\nTranslation of Verne into English began in 1852, when Verne's short story *A Voyage in a Balloon* (1851) was published in the American journal *Sartain's Union Magazine of Literature and Art* in a translation by Anne T. Wilbur.[112] Translation of his novels began in 1869 with William Lackland's translation of *Five Weeks in a Balloon* (originally published in 1863),[113] and continued steadily throughout Verne's lifetime, with publishers and hired translators often working in great haste to rush his most lucrative titles into English-language print.[114] Unlike Hetzel, who targeted all ages with his publishing strategies for the *Voyages extraordinaires*, the British and American publishers of Verne chose to market his books almost exclusively to young audiences; this business move, with its implication that Verne could be treated purely as a children's author, had a long-lasting effect on Verne's reputation in English-speaking countries.[110][115]\n\n\nThese early English-language translations have been widely criticized for their extensive textual omissions, errors, and alterations, and are not considered adequate representations of Verne's actual novels.[114][116][117] In an essay for *The Guardian*, British writer Adam Roberts commented: \"I'd always liked reading Jules Verne and I've read most of his novels; but it wasn't until recently that I really understood I hadn't been reading Jules Verne at all ... It's a bizarre situation for a world-famous writer to be in. Indeed, I can't think of a major writer who has been so poorly served by translation.\"[116]\n\n\nSimilarly, the American novelist Michael Crichton observed:\n\n\n\n\n> Verne's prose is lean and fast-moving in a peculiarly modern way ... [but] Verne has been particularly ill-served by his English translators. At best they have provided us with clunky, choppy, tone-deaf prose. At worst – as in the notorious 1872 \"translation\" [of *Journey to the Center of the Earth*] published by Griffith & Farran – they have blithely altered the text, giving Verne's characters new names, and adding whole pages of their own invention, thus effectively obliterating the meaning and tone of Verne's original.[117]\n> \n> \n\n\nSince 1965, a considerable number of more accurate English translations of Verne have appeared. However, the older, deficient translations continue to be republished due to their public domain status, and in many cases their easy availability in online sources.[110]\n\n\n\n### Relationship with science fiction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Caricature of Verne with fantastic sea life (1884)\nThe relationship between Verne's *Voyages extraordinaires* and the literary genre science fiction is a complex one. Verne, like H. G. Wells, is frequently cited as one of the founders of the genre, and his profound influence on its development is indisputable; however, many earlier writers, such as Lucian of Samosata, Voltaire, and Mary Shelley, have also been cited as creators of science fiction, an unavoidable ambiguity arising from the vague definition and history of the genre.[7]\n\n\nA primary issue at the heart of the dispute is the question of whether Verne's works count as science fiction to begin with. Maurice Renard claimed that Verne \"never wrote a single sentence of scientific-marvelous\".[118] Verne himself argued repeatedly in interviews that his novels were not meant to be read as scientific, saying \"I have invented nothing\".[119] His own goal was rather to \"depict the earth [and] at the same time to realize a very high ideal of beauty of style\",[71] as he pointed out in an example:\n\n\n\n\n> I wrote *Five Weeks in a Balloon*, not as a story about ballooning, but as a story about Africa. I always was greatly interested in geography, history and travel, and I wanted to give a romantic description of Africa. Now, there was no means of taking my travellers through Africa otherwise than in a balloon, and that is why a balloon is introduced.… I may say that at the time I wrote the novel, as now, I had no faith in the possibility of ever steering balloons…[71]\n> \n> \n\n\nClosely related to Verne's science-fiction reputation is the often-repeated claim that he is a \"prophet\" of scientific progress, and that many of his novels involve elements of technology that were fantastic for his day but later became commonplace.[120] These claims have a long history, especially in America, but the modern scholarly consensus is that such claims of prophecy are heavily exaggerated.[121] In a 1961 article critical of *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas*' scientific accuracy, Theodore L. Thomas speculated that Verne's storytelling skill and readers' faulty memories of a book they read as children caused people to \"remember things from it that are not there. The impression that the novel contains valid scientific prediction seems to grow as the years roll by\".[122] As with science fiction, Verne himself flatly denied that he was a futuristic prophet, saying that any connection between scientific developments and his work was \"mere coincidence\" and attributing his indisputable scientific accuracy to his extensive research: \"even before I began writing stories, I always took numerous notes out of every book, newspaper, magazine, or scientific report that I came across.\"[123]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cultural influence of Jules Verne\n\n![](image)Monument to Verne in Redondela, Spain\nVerne's novels have had a wide influence on both literary and scientific works; writers known to have been influenced by Verne include Marcel Aymé, Roland Barthes, René Barjavel, Michel Butor, Blaise Cendrars, Paul Claudel, Jean Cocteau, Julio Cortázar, François Mauriac, Rick Riordan, Raymond Roussel, Claude Roy, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, and Jean-Paul Sartre,[124] while scientists and explorers who acknowledged Verne's inspiration have included Richard E. Byrd, Yuri Gagarin, Simon Lake, Hubert Lyautey, Guglielmo Marconi, Fridtjof Nansen, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Wernher von Braun,[109] and Jack Parsons.[125] Verne is credited with helping inspire the steampunk genre, a literary and social movement that glamorizes science fiction based on 19th-century technology.[126][127]\n\n\nRay Bradbury summarized Verne's influence on literature and science the world over by saying: \"We are all, in one way or another, the children of Jules Verne.\"[128]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n\n\n* Legion of Honour\n* List of Legion of Honour recipients by name (V)\n* Legion of Honour Museum\n* Scientific Marvelous\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** These six, and most of Verne's novels, were published in the Voyages extraordinaires series.\n2. **^** Jules-Verne 1976, p. 1: \"On his mother's side, Verne is known to be descended from one 'N.

He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.[3][4][5] He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"the Bard\"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[6] Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.\n\n\nShakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner (sharer) of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.[7][8][9]\n\n\nShakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613.[10][11] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them *Hamlet*, *Romeo and Juliet*, *Othello*, *King Lear*, and *Macbeth*, all considered to be among the finest works in the English language.[3][4][5] In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.\n\n\nMany of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However, in 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its Preface was a prescient poem by Ben Jonson, a former rival of Shakespeare, that hailed Shakespeare with the now famous epithet: \"not of an age, but for all time\".[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Life of William Shakespeare\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Shakespeare's house, believed to be Shakespeare's birthplace, in Stratford-upon-Avon\nShakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover (glove-maker) originally from Snitterfield in Warwickshire, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning family.[13] He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was baptised on 26 April 1564. His date of birth is unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day.[1] This date, which can be traced to William Oldys and George Steevens, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616.[14][15] He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.[16]\n\n\nAlthough no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford,[17][18][19] a free school chartered in 1553,[20] about a quarter-mile (400 m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree,[21][22] and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.[23]\n\n\nAt the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage.[24] The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times,[25][26] and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583.[27] Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585.[28] Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596.[29]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shakespeare's coat of arms, from the 1602 book *The book of coates and creasts. Promptuarium armorum.* It features spears as a pun on the family name.[c]\nAfter the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance of his name in the \"complaints bill\" of a law case before the Queen's Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October 1589.[30] Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare's \"lost years\".[31] Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories. Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare's first biographer, recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy. Shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him.[32][33] Another 18th-century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London.[34] John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster.[35] Some 20th-century scholars suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire, a Catholic landowner who named a certain \"William Shakeshafte\" in his will.[36][37] Little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death, and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area.[38][39]\n\n\n\n### London and theatrical career[edit]\n\n\nIt is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592.[40] By then, he was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his *Groats-Worth of Wit* from that year:\n\n\n\n\n> ... there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his *Tiger's heart wrapped in a Player's hide*, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute *Johannes factotum*, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.[41]\n> \n> \n\n\nScholars differ on the exact meaning of Greene's words,[41][42] but most agree that Greene was accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe, and Greene himself (the so-called \"University Wits\").[43] The italicised phrase parodying the line \"Oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide\" from Shakespeare's *Henry VI, Part 3*, along with the pun \"Shake-scene\", clearly identify Shakespeare as Greene's target. As used here, *Johannes Factotum* (\"Jack of all trades\") refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common \"universal genius\".[41][44]\n\n\nGreene's attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare's work in the theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greene's remarks.[45][46][47] After 1594, Shakespeare's plays were performed only by the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company owned by a group of players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in London.[48] After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new King James I, and changed its name to the King's Men.[49]\n\n\n\n> \n> All the world's a stage,  \n> \n> and all the men and women merely players:  \n> \n> they have their exits and their entrances;  \n> \n> and one man in his time plays many parts ...\n> \n> \n\n\n—*As You Like It*, Act II, Scene 7, 139–142[50]\n\nIn 1599, a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man,[51] and in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford.[52]\n\n\nSome of Shakespeare's plays were published in quarto editions, beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages.[53][54][55] Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson's *Works* names him on the cast lists for *Every Man in His Humour* (1598) and *Sejanus His Fall* (1603).[56] The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's *Volpone* is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end.[45] The First Folio of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one of \"the Principal Actors in all these Plays\", some of which were first staged after *Volpone*, although one cannot know for certain which roles he played.[57] In 1610, John Davies of Hereford wrote that \"good Will\" played \"kingly\" roles.[58] In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet's father.[59] Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in *As You Like It*, and the Chorus in *Henry V*,[60][61] though scholars doubt the sources of that information.[62]\n\n\nThroughout his career, Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford. In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St Helen's, Bishopsgate, north of the River Thames.[63][64] He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the same year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there.[63][65] By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of St Paul's Cathedral with many fine houses. There, he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of women's wigs and other headgear.[66][67]\n\n\n\n### Later years and death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shakespeare's funerary monument in Stratford-upon-Avon\nNicholas Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Samuel Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford \"some years before his death\".[68][69] He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an answer to the sharers' petition in 1635, Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King's Men \"placed men players\" there, \"which were Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, etc.\".[70] However, it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609.[71][72] The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610),[73] which meant there was often no acting work. Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time.[74] Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 1611–1614.[68] In 1612, he was called as a witness in *Bellott v Mountjoy*, a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy's daughter, Mary.[75][76] In March 1613, he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory;[77] and from November 1614, he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law, John Hall.[78] After 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613.[79] His last three plays were collaborations, probably with John Fletcher,[80] who succeeded him as the house playwright of the King's Men. He retired in 1613, before the Globe Theatre burned down during the performance of *Henry VIII* on 29 June.[79]\n\n\nShakespeare died on 23 April 1616, at the age of 52.[d] He died within a month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself as being in \"perfect health\". No extant contemporary source explains how or why he died. Half a century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in his notebook: \"Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted\",[82][83] not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death: \"We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went'st so soon / From the world's stage to the grave's tiring room.\"[84][e]\n\n\n\n![](image)Holy Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon, where Shakespeare was baptised and is buried\nHe was survived by his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607,[85] and Judith had married Thomas Quiney, a vintner, two months before Shakespeare's death.[86] Shakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 March 1616; the following day, his new son-in-law, Thomas Quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler, who had died during childbirth. Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family.[86]\n\n\nShakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna[87] under stipulations that she pass it down intact to \"the first son of her body\".[88] The Quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying.[89][90] The Halls had one child, Elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending Shakespeare's direct line.[91][92] Shakespeare's will scarcely mentions his wife, Anne, who was probably entitled to one-third of his estate automatically.[f] He did make a point, however, of leaving her \"my second best bed\", a bequest that has led to much speculation.[94][95][96] Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne, whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shakespeare's grave, next to those of Anne Shakespeare, his wife, and Thomas Nash, the husband of his granddaughter\nShakespeare was buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church two days after his death.[98][99] The epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones, which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008:[100]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Good frend for Iesvs sake forbeare,\nTo digg the dvst encloased heare.\nBleste be yͤ man yͭ spares thes stones,\nAnd cvrst be he yͭ moves my bones.*[101][g]*\n | Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear,\nTo dig the dust enclosed here.\nBlessed be the man that spares these stones,\nAnd cursed be he that moves my bones.\n |\n\n\nSome time before 1623, a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall, with a half-effigy of him in the act of writing. Its plaque compares him to Nestor, Socrates, and Virgil.[102] In 1623, in conjunction with the publication of the First Folio, the Droeshout engraving was published.[103] Shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world, including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.[104][105]\n\n\n\n## Plays[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Shakespeare's plays, William Shakespeare's collaborations, and Shakespeare bibliography\n\n![](image)*Procession of Characters from Shakespeare's Plays* by an unknown 19th-century artist\nMost playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, as critics agree Shakespeare did, mostly early and late in his career.[106]\n\n\nThe first recorded works of Shakespeare are *Richard III* and the three parts of *Henry VI*, written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare's plays are difficult to date precisely, however,[107][108] and studies of the texts suggest that *Titus Andronicus*, *The Comedy of Errors*, *The Taming of the Shrew,* and *The Two Gentlemen of Verona* may also belong to Shakespeare's earliest period.[109][107] His first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed's *Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland*,[110] dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty.[111] The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of Seneca.[112][113][114] *The Comedy of Errors* was also based on classical models, but no source for *The Taming of the Shrew* has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story.[115][116] Like *The Two Gentlemen of Verona*, in which two friends appear to approve of rape,[117][118][119] the *Shrew*'s story of the taming of a woman's independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics, directors, and audiences.[120]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing*. By William Blake, c. 1786.\nShakespeare's early classical and Italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies.[121] *A Midsummer Night's Dream* is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes.[122] Shakespeare's next comedy, the equally romantic *Merchant of Venice*, contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock, which reflects dominant Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences.[123][124] The wit and wordplay of *Much Ado About Nothing*,[125] the charming rural setting of *As You Like It*, and the lively merrymaking of *Twelfth Night* complete Shakespeare's sequence of great comedies.[126] After the lyrical *Richard II*, written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, *Henry IV, parts 1* and *2*, and *Henry V*. His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work.[127][128][129] This period begins and ends with two tragedies: *Romeo and Juliet*, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death;[130][131] and *Julius Caesar*—based on Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation of Plutarch's *Parallel Lives*—which introduced a new kind of drama.[132][133] According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro, in *Julius Caesar*, \"the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even Shakespeare's own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other\".[134]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus, and the Ghost of Hamlet's Father*. Henry Fuseli, 1780–1785.\nIn the early 17th century, Shakespeare wrote the so-called \"problem plays\" *Measure for Measure*, *Troilus and Cressida*, and *All's Well That Ends Well* and a number of his best known tragedies.[135][136] Many critics believe that Shakespeare's greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art. The titular hero of one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies, *Hamlet*, has probably been discussed more than any other Shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which begins \"To be or not to be; that is the question\".[137] Unlike the introverted Hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, the heroes of the tragedies that followed, Othello and King Lear, are undone by hasty errors of judgement.[138] The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves.[139] In *Othello*, the villain Iago stokes Othello's sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him.[140][141] In *King Lear*, the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear's youngest daughter Cordelia. According to the critic Frank Kermode, \"the play...offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty\".[142][143][144] In *Macbeth*, the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare's tragedies,[145] uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife, Lady Macbeth, to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn.[146] In this play, Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure. His last major tragedies, *Antony and Cleopatra* and *Coriolanus*, contain some of Shakespeare's finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T. S. Eliot.[147][148][149]\n\n\nIn his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: *Cymbeline*, *The Winter's Tale,* and *The Tempest*, as well as the collaboration, *Pericles, Prince of Tyre*. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.[150] Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day.[151][152][153] Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, *Henry VIII* and *The Two Noble Kinsmen*, probably with John Fletcher.[154]\n\n\n\n### Classification[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chronology of Shakespeare's plays\n\n![](image)*The Plays of William Shakespeare*, a painting containing scenes and characters from several plays of Shakespeare; by Sir John Gilbert, c. 1849\nShakespeare's works include the 36 plays printed in the First Folio of 1623, listed according to their folio classification as comedies, histories, and tragedies.[155] Two plays not included in the First Folio,[12] *The Two Noble Kinsmen* and *Pericles, Prince of Tyre*, are now accepted as part of the canon, with today's scholars agreeing that Shakespeare made major contributions to the writing of both.[156][157] No Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio.\n\n\nIn the late 19th century, Edward Dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances, and though many scholars prefer to call them *tragicomedies*, Dowden's term is often used.[158][159] In 1896, Frederick S. Boas coined the term \"problem plays\" to describe four plays: *All's Well That Ends Well*, *Measure for Measure*, *Troilus and Cressida,* and *Hamlet*.[160] \"Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies\", he wrote. \"We may, therefore, borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeare's problem plays.\"[161] The term, much debated and sometimes applied to other plays, remains in use, though *Hamlet* is definitively classed as a tragedy.[162][163][164]\n\n\n\n### Performances[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shakespeare in performance\n\nIt is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays. The title page of the 1594 edition of *Titus Andronicus* reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes.[165] After the plagues of 1592–93, Shakespeare's plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch, north of the Thames.[166] Londoners flocked there to see the first part of *Henry IV*, Leonard Digges recording, \"Let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest ... and you scarce shall have a room\".[167] When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark.[168][169] The Globe opened in autumn 1599, with *Julius Caesar* one of the first plays staged. Most of Shakespeare's greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe, including *Hamlet*, *Othello,* and *King Lear*.[168][170][171]\n\n\n\n![](image)The reconstructed Globe Theatre on the south bank of the River Thames in London\nAfter the Lord Chamberlain's Men were renamed the King's Men in 1603, they entered a special relationship with the new King James. Although the performance records are patchy, the King's Men performed seven of Shakespeare's plays at court between 1 November 1604, and 31 October 1605, including two performances of *The Merchant of Venice*.[61] After 1608, they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer.[172] The indoor setting, combined with the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques, allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. In *Cymbeline*, for example, Jupiter descends \"in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees.\"[173][174]\n\n\nThe actors in Shakespeare's company included the famous Richard Burbage, William Kempe, Henry Condell and John Heminges. Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including *Richard III*, *Hamlet*, *Othello*, and *King Lear*.[175] The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in *Romeo and Juliet* and Dogberry in *Much Ado About Nothing*, among other characters.[176][177] He was replaced around 1600 by Robert Armin, who played roles such as Touchstone in *As You Like It* and the fool in *King Lear*.[178] In 1613, Sir Henry Wotton recorded that *Henry VIII* \"was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony\".[179] On 29 June, however, a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe and burned the theatre to the ground, an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision.[179]\n\n\n\n\n### Textual sources[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Title page of the *First Folio*, 1623. Copper engraving of Shakespeare by Martin Droeshout.\nIn 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two of Shakespeare's friends from the King's Men, published the First Folio, a collected edition of Shakespeare's plays. It contained 36 texts, including 18 printed for the first time.[180] The others had already appeared in quarto versions—flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves.[181] No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions, which the First Folio describes as \"stol'n and surreptitious copies\".[182]\n\n\nAlfred Pollard termed some of the pre-1623 versions as \"bad quartos\" because of their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory.[181][182][183] Where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the other. The differences may stem from copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from Shakespeare's own papers.[184][185] In some cases, for example, *Hamlet*, *Troilus and Cressida,* and *Othello*, Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. In the case of *King Lear*, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto that the *Oxford Shakespeare* prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.[186]\n\n\n\n## Poems[edit]\n\n\nIn 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare published two narrative poems on sexual themes, *Venus and Adonis* and *The Rape of Lucrece*. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In *Venus and Adonis*, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in *The Rape of Lucrece*, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin.[187] Influenced by Ovid's *Metamorphoses*,[188] the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust.[189] Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, *A Lover's Complaint*, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the *Sonnets* in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote *A Lover's Complaint*. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects.[190][191][192] *The Phoenix and the Turtle*, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 *Love's Martyr*, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in *The Passionate Pilgrim*, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission.[190][192][193]\n\n\n\n### Sonnets[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shakespeare's sonnets\n\n![](image)Title page from 1609 edition of *Shake-Speares Sonnets*\nPublished in 1609, the *Sonnets* were the last of Shakespeare's non-dramatic works to be printed. Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership.[194][195] Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in *The Passionate Pilgrim* in 1599, Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare's \"sugred Sonnets among his private friends\".[196] Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare's intended sequence.[197] He seems to have planned two contrasting series: one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion (the \"dark lady\"), and one about conflicted love for a fair young man (the \"fair youth\"). It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial \"I\" who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself, though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets \"Shakespeare unlocked his heart\".[196][195]\n\n\n\n> \n> Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?  \n> \n> Thou art more lovely and more temperate ...\n> \n> \n\n\n—Opening lines from Shakespeare's *Sonnet 18*.[198]\n\nThe 1609 edition was dedicated to a \"Mr. W.H.\", credited as \"the only begetter\" of the poems. It is not known whether this was written by Shakespeare himself or by the publisher, Thomas Thorpe, whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page; nor is it known who Mr. W.H. was, despite numerous theories, or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication.[199] Critics praise the *Sonnets* as a profound meditation on the nature of love, sexual passion, procreation, death, and time.[200]\n\n\n\n## Style[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shakespeare's writing style\n\nShakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama.[201] The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in *Titus Andronicus*, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in *The Two Gentlemen of Verona* has been described as stilted.[202][203]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Pity* by William Blake, 1795, is an illustration of two similes in *Macbeth*:\"And pity, like a naked new-born babe,  \n\nStriding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd  \n\nUpon the sightless couriers of the air.\"[204]\n\nHowever, Shakespeare soon began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of *Richard III* has its roots in the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays.[205][206] No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with *Romeo and Juliet* perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles.[207] By the time of *Romeo and Juliet*, *Richard II*, and *A Midsummer Night's Dream* in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.\n\n\nShakespeare's standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony.[208] Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as *Julius Caesar* and *Hamlet*. Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind:[209]\n\n\n\n\n> Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting  \n> \n> That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay  \n> \n> Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly—  \n> \n> And prais'd be rashness for it—let us know  \n> \n> Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well ...\n> \n> — *Hamlet*, Act 5, Scene 2, 4–8[209]\n> \n\n\nAfter *Hamlet*, Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as \"more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical\".[210] In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length.[211] In *Macbeth*, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: \"was the hope drunk/ Wherein you dressed yourself?\" (1.7.35–38); \"... pity, like a naked new-born babe/ Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air ...\" (1.7.21–25). The listener is challenged to complete the sense.[211] The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.[212]\n\n\nShakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre.[213] Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed.[214] He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting, and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama.[215] As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In Shakespeare's late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.[216][217]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Influence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shakespeare's influence\n\n![](image)*Macbeth Consulting the Vision of the Armed Head*. By Henry Fuseli, 1793–1794.\nShakespeare's work has made a significant and lasting impression on later theatre and literature. In particular, he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation, plot, language, and genre.[218] Until *Romeo and Juliet*, for example, romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy.[219] Soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events, but Shakespeare used them to explore characters' minds.[220] His work heavily influenced later poetry. The Romantic poets attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama, though with little success. Critic George Steiner described all English verse dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson as \"feeble variations on Shakespearean themes.\"[221] John Milton, considered by many to be the most important English poet after Shakespeare, wrote in tribute: \"Thou in our wonder and astonishment/ Has built thyself a live-long monument.\"[222]\n\n\nShakespeare influenced novelists such as Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melville's soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in *Moby-Dick* is a classic tragic hero, inspired by *King Lear*.[223] Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare's works. These include three operas by Giuseppe Verdi, *Macbeth*, *Otello* and *Falstaff*, whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays.[224] Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites, while William Hogarth's 1745 painting of actor David Garrick playing Richard III was decisive in establishing the genre of theatrical portraiture in Britain.[225] The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli, a friend of William Blake, even translated *Macbeth* into German.[226] The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology, in particular, that of Hamlet, for his theories of human nature.[227] Shakespeare has been a rich source for filmmakers; Akira Kurosawa adapted *Macbeth* and *King Lear* as *Throne of Blood* and *Ran*, respectively. Other examples of Shakespeare on film include Max Reinhardt's *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, Laurence Olivier's *Hamlet* and Al Pacino's documentary *Looking For Richard*.[228] Orson Welles, a lifelong lover of Shakespeare, directed and starred in films of *Macbeth* and *Othello*, and *Chimes at Midnight*, in which he plays John Falstaff, which Welles himself called his best work.[229]\n\n\nIn Shakespeare's day, English grammar, spelling, and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now,[230] and his use of language helped shape modern English.[231] Samuel Johnson quoted him more often than any other author in his *A Dictionary of the English Language*, the first serious work of its type.[232] Expressions such as \"with bated breath\" (*Merchant of Venice*) and \"a foregone conclusion\" (*Othello*) have found their way into everyday English speech.[233][234]\n\n\nShakespeare's influence extends far beyond his native England and the English language. His reception in Germany was particularly significant; as early as the 18th century Shakespeare was widely translated and popularised in Germany, and gradually became a \"classic of the German Weimar era;\" Christoph Martin Wieland was the first to produce complete translations of Shakespeare's plays in any language.[235][236] Actor and theatre director Simon Callow writes, \"this master, this titan, this genius, so profoundly British and so effortlessly universal, each different culture – German, Italian, Russian – was obliged to respond to the Shakespearean example; for the most part, they embraced it, and him, with joyous abandon, as the possibilities of language and character in action that he celebrated liberated writers across the continent. Some of the most deeply affecting productions of Shakespeare have been non-English, and non-European. He is that unique writer: he has something for everyone.\"[237]\n\n\nAccording to *Guinness World Records*, Shakespeare remains the world's best-selling playwright, with sales of his plays and poetry believed to have achieved in excess of four billion copies in the almost 400 years since his death. He is also the third most translated author in history.[238]\n\n\n\n### Critical reputation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Reputation of William Shakespeare and Timeline of Shakespeare criticism\n\n> \n> He was not of an age, but for all time.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Ben Jonson[239]\n\nShakespeare was not revered in his lifetime, but he received a large amount of praise.[240][241] In 1598, the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out from a group of English playwrights as \"the most excellent\" in both comedy and tragedy.[242][243] The authors of the *Parnassus* plays at St John's College, Cambridge, numbered him with Chaucer, Gower, and Spenser.[244] In the First Folio, Ben Jonson called Shakespeare the \"Soul of the age, the applause, delight, the wonder of our stage\", although he had remarked elsewhere that \"Shakespeare wanted art\" (lacked skill).[239]\n\n\nBetween the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century, classical ideas were in vogue. As a result, critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson.[245] Thomas Rymer, for example, condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic. Nevertheless, poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly, saying of Jonson, \"I admire him, but I love Shakespeare\".[246] He also famously remarked that Shakespeare \"was naturally learned; he needed not the spectacles of books to read nature; he looked inwards, and found her there.\"[247] For several decades, Rymer's view held sway. But during the 18th century, critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and, like Dryden, to acclaim what they termed his natural genius. A series of scholarly editions of his work, notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790, added to his growing reputation.[248][249] By 1800, he was firmly enshrined as the national poet,[250] and described as the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"the Bard\").[251][h] In the 18th and 19th centuries, his reputation also spread abroad. Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire, Goethe, Stendhal, and Victor Hugo.[253][i]\n\n\n\n![](image)William Ordway Partridge's garlanded statue of William Shakespeare in Lincoln Park, Chicago, typical of many created in the 19th and early 20th centuries\nDuring the Romantic era, Shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and the critic August Wilhelm Schlegel translated his plays in the spirit of German Romanticism.[255] In the 19th century, critical admiration for Shakespeare's genius often bordered on adulation.[256] \"This King Shakespeare,\" the essayist Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1840, \"does not he shine, in crowned sovereignty, over us all, as the noblest, gentlest, yet strongest of rallying signs; indestructible\".[257] The Victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale.[258] The playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw mocked the cult of Shakespeare worship as \"bardolatry\", claiming that the new naturalism of Ibsen's plays had made Shakespeare obsolete.[259]\n\n\nThe modernist revolution in the arts during the early 20th century, far from discarding Shakespeare, eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the avant-garde. The Expressionists in Germany and the Futurists in Moscow mounted productions of his plays. Marxist playwright and director Bertolt Brecht devised an epic theatre under the influence of Shakespeare. The poet and critic T. S. Eliot argued against Shaw that Shakespeare's \"primitiveness\" in fact made him truly modern.[260] Eliot, along with G. Wilson Knight and the school of New Criticism, led a movement towards a closer reading of Shakespeare's imagery. In the 1950s, a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for post-modern studies of Shakespeare.[261] By the 1980s, Shakespeare studies were open to movements such as structuralism, feminism, New Historicism, African-American studies, and queer studies.[262][263] Comparing Shakespeare's accomplishments to those of leading figures in philosophy and theology, Harold Bloom wrote, \"Shakespeare was larger than Plato and than St. Augustine. He *encloses* us because we *see* with his fundamental perceptions.\"[264]\n\n\n\n## Speculation[edit]\n\n\n### Authorship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shakespeare authorship question\n\nAround 230 years after Shakespeare's death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him.[265] Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.[266] Several \"group theories\" have also been proposed.[267] All but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe theory, with only a small minority of academics who believe that there is reason to question the traditional attribution,[268] but interest in the subject, particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, continues into the 21st century.[269][270][271]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religious views of William Shakespeare\n\nShakespeare conformed to the official state religion,[j] but his private views on religion have been the subject of debate. Shakespeare's will uses a Protestant formula, and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England, where he was married, his children were baptised, and where he is buried. Some scholars claim that members of Shakespeare's family were Catholics, at a time when practising Catholicism in England was against the law.[273] Shakespeare's mother, Mary Arden, certainly came from a pious Catholic family. The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by his father, John Shakespeare, found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street. However, the document is now lost and scholars differ as to its authenticity.[274][275] In 1591, the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church \"for fear of process for debt\", a common Catholic excuse.[276][277][278] In 1606, the name of William's daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford.[276][277][278] Other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about Shakespeare's religious beliefs. Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare's Catholicism, Protestantism, or lack of belief in his plays, but the truth may be impossible to prove.[279][280]\n\n\n\n### Sexuality[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sexuality of William Shakespeare\n\nFew details of Shakespeare's sexuality are known. At 18, he married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway, who was pregnant. Susanna, the first of their three children, was born six months later on 26 May 1583. Over the centuries, some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical,[281] and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love.[282][283][284] The 26 so-called \"Dark Lady\" sonnets, addressed to a married woman, are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons.[285]\n\n\n\n### Portraiture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Portraits of Shakespeare\n\nNo written contemporary description of Shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait, so the Droeshout engraving, which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness,[286] and his Stratford monument provide perhaps the best evidence of his appearance. From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led to the production of several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, repaintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people.[287]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of William Shakespeare\n* English Renaissance theatre\n* Spelling of Shakespeare's name\n* *World Shakespeare Bibliography*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The concept that Shakespeare was born on 23 April, contrary to belief, is a tradition, and not a fact;[1] see § Early life below.\n2. **^** Dates follow the Julian calendar, used in England throughout Shakespeare's lifespan, but with the start of the year adjusted to 1 January (see Old Style and New Style dates).

He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.[3][4][5] He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"the Bard\"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[6] Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.\n\n\nShakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner (sharer) of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.[7][8][9]\n\n\nShakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613.[10][11] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them *Hamlet*, *Romeo and Juliet*, *Othello*, *King Lear*, and *Macbeth*, all considered to be among the finest works in the English language.[3][4][5] In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.\n\n\nMany of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However, in 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its Preface was a prescient poem by Ben Jonson, a former rival of Shakespeare, that hailed Shakespeare with the now famous epithet: \"not of an age, but for all time\".[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Life of William Shakespeare\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Shakespeare's house, believed to be Shakespeare's birthplace, in Stratford-upon-Avon\nShakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover (glove-maker) originally from Snitterfield in Warwickshire, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning family.[13] He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was baptised on 26 April 1564. His date of birth is unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day.[1] This date, which can be traced to William Oldys and George Steevens, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616.[14][15] He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.[16]\n\n\nAlthough no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford,[17][18][19] a free school chartered in 1553,[20] about a quarter-mile (400 m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree,[21][22] and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.[23]\n\n\nAt the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage.[24] The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times,[25][26] and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583.[27] Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585.[28] Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596.[29]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shakespeare's coat of arms, from the 1602 book *The book of coates and creasts. Promptuarium armorum.* It features spears as a pun on the family name.[c]\nAfter the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance of his name in the \"complaints bill\" of a law case before the Queen's Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October 1589.[30] Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare's \"lost years\".[31] Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories. Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare's first biographer, recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy. Shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him.[32][33] Another 18th-century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London.[34] John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster.[35] Some 20th-century scholars suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire, a Catholic landowner who named a certain \"William Shakeshafte\" in his will.[36][37] Little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death, and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area.[38][39]\n\n\n\n### London and theatrical career[edit]\n\n\nIt is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592.[40] By then, he was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his *Groats-Worth of Wit* from that year:\n\n\n\n\n> ... there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his *Tiger's heart wrapped in a Player's hide*, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute *Johannes factotum*, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.[41]\n> \n> \n\n\nScholars differ on the exact meaning of Greene's words,[41][42] but most agree that Greene was accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe, and Greene himself (the so-called \"University Wits\").[43] The italicised phrase parodying the line \"Oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide\" from Shakespeare's *Henry VI, Part 3*, along with the pun \"Shake-scene\", clearly identify Shakespeare as Greene's target. As used here, *Johannes Factotum* (\"Jack of all trades\") refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common \"universal genius\".[41][44]\n\n\nGreene's attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare's work in the theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greene's remarks.[45][46][47] After 1594, Shakespeare's plays were performed only by the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company owned by a group of players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in London.[48] After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new King James I, and changed its name to the King's Men.[49]\n\n\n\n> \n> All the world's a stage,  \n> \n> and all the men and women merely players:  \n> \n> they have their exits and their entrances;  \n> \n> and one man in his time plays many parts ...\n> \n> \n\n\n—*As You Like It*, Act II, Scene 7, 139–142[50]\n\nIn 1599, a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man,[51] and in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford.[52]\n\n\nSome of Shakespeare's plays were published in quarto editions, beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages.[53][54][55] Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson's *Works* names him on the cast lists for *Every Man in His Humour* (1598) and *Sejanus His Fall* (1603).[56] The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's *Volpone* is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end.[45] The First Folio of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one of \"the Principal Actors in all these Plays\", some of which were first staged after *Volpone*, although one cannot know for certain which roles he played.[57] In 1610, John Davies of Hereford wrote that \"good Will\" played \"kingly\" roles.[58] In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet's father.[59] Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in *As You Like It*, and the Chorus in *Henry V*,[60][61] though scholars doubt the sources of that information.[62]\n\n\nThroughout his career, Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford. In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St Helen's, Bishopsgate, north of the River Thames.[63][64] He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the same year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there.[63][65] By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of St Paul's Cathedral with many fine houses. There, he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of women's wigs and other headgear.[66][67]\n\n\n\n### Later years and death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shakespeare's funerary monument in Stratford-upon-Avon\nNicholas Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Samuel Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford \"some years before his death\".[68][69] He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an answer to the sharers' petition in 1635, Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King's Men \"placed men players\" there, \"which were Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, etc.\".[70] However, it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609.[71][72] The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610),[73] which meant there was often no acting work. Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time.[74] Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 1611–1614.[68] In 1612, he was called as a witness in *Bellott v Mountjoy*, a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy's daughter, Mary.[75][76] In March 1613, he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory;[77] and from November 1614, he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law, John Hall.[78] After 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613.[79] His last three plays were collaborations, probably with John Fletcher,[80] who succeeded him as the house playwright of the King's Men. He retired in 1613, before the Globe Theatre burned down during the performance of *Henry VIII* on 29 June.[79]\n\n\nShakespeare died on 23 April 1616, at the age of 52.[d] He died within a month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself as being in \"perfect health\". No extant contemporary source explains how or why he died. Half a century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in his notebook: \"Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted\",[82][83] not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death: \"We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went'st so soon / From the world's stage to the grave's tiring room.\"[84][e]\n\n\n\n![](image)Holy Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon, where Shakespeare was baptised and is buried\nHe was survived by his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607,[85] and Judith had married Thomas Quiney, a vintner, two months before Shakespeare's death.[86] Shakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 March 1616; the following day, his new son-in-law, Thomas Quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler, who had died during childbirth. Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family.[86]\n\n\nShakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna[87] under stipulations that she pass it down intact to \"the first son of her body\".[88] The Quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying.[89][90] The Halls had one child, Elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending Shakespeare's direct line.[91][92] Shakespeare's will scarcely mentions his wife, Anne, who was probably entitled to one-third of his estate automatically.[f] He did make a point, however, of leaving her \"my second best bed\", a bequest that has led to much speculation.[94][95][96] Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne, whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shakespeare's grave, next to those of Anne Shakespeare, his wife, and Thomas Nash, the husband of his granddaughter\nShakespeare was buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church two days after his death.[98][99] The epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones, which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008:[100]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Good frend for Iesvs sake forbeare,\nTo digg the dvst encloased heare.\nBleste be yͤ man yͭ spares thes stones,\nAnd cvrst be he yͭ moves my bones.*[101][g]*\n | Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear,\nTo dig the dust enclosed here.\nBlessed be the man that spares these stones,\nAnd cursed be he that moves my bones.\n |\n\n\nSome time before 1623, a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall, with a half-effigy of him in the act of writing. Its plaque compares him to Nestor, Socrates, and Virgil.[102] In 1623, in conjunction with the publication of the First Folio, the Droeshout engraving was published.[103] Shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world, including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.[104][105]\n\n\n\n## Plays[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Shakespeare's plays, William Shakespeare's collaborations, and Shakespeare bibliography\n\n![](image)*Procession of Characters from Shakespeare's Plays* by an unknown 19th-century artist\nMost playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, as critics agree Shakespeare did, mostly early and late in his career.[106]\n\n\nThe first recorded works of Shakespeare are *Richard III* and the three parts of *Henry VI*, written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare's plays are difficult to date precisely, however,[107][108] and studies of the texts suggest that *Titus Andronicus*, *The Comedy of Errors*, *The Taming of the Shrew,* and *The Two Gentlemen of Verona* may also belong to Shakespeare's earliest period.[109][107] His first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed's *Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland*,[110] dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty.[111] The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of Seneca.[112][113][114] *The Comedy of Errors* was also based on classical models, but no source for *The Taming of the Shrew* has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story.[115][116] Like *The Two Gentlemen of Verona*, in which two friends appear to approve of rape,[117][118][119] the *Shrew*'s story of the taming of a woman's independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics, directors, and audiences.[120]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing*. By William Blake, c. 1786.\nShakespeare's early classical and Italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies.[121] *A Midsummer Night's Dream* is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes.[122] Shakespeare's next comedy, the equally romantic *Merchant of Venice*, contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock, which reflects dominant Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences.[123][124] The wit and wordplay of *Much Ado About Nothing*,[125] the charming rural setting of *As You Like It*, and the lively merrymaking of *Twelfth Night* complete Shakespeare's sequence of great comedies.[126] After the lyrical *Richard II*, written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, *Henry IV, parts 1* and *2*, and *Henry V*. His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work.[127][128][129] This period begins and ends with two tragedies: *Romeo and Juliet*, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death;[130][131] and *Julius Caesar*—based on Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation of Plutarch's *Parallel Lives*—which introduced a new kind of drama.[132][133] According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro, in *Julius Caesar*, \"the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even Shakespeare's own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other\".[134]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus, and the Ghost of Hamlet's Father*. Henry Fuseli, 1780–1785.\nIn the early 17th century, Shakespeare wrote the so-called \"problem plays\" *Measure for Measure*, *Troilus and Cressida*, and *All's Well That Ends Well* and a number of his best known tragedies.[135][136] Many critics believe that Shakespeare's greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art. The titular hero of one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies, *Hamlet*, has probably been discussed more than any other Shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which begins \"To be or not to be; that is the question\".[137] Unlike the introverted Hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, the heroes of the tragedies that followed, Othello and King Lear, are undone by hasty errors of judgement.[138] The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves.[139] In *Othello*, the villain Iago stokes Othello's sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him.[140][141] In *King Lear*, the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear's youngest daughter Cordelia. According to the critic Frank Kermode, \"the play...offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty\".[142][143][144] In *Macbeth*, the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare's tragedies,[145] uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife, Lady Macbeth, to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn.[146] In this play, Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure. His last major tragedies, *Antony and Cleopatra* and *Coriolanus*, contain some of Shakespeare's finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T. S. Eliot.[147][148][149]\n\n\nIn his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: *Cymbeline*, *The Winter's Tale,* and *The Tempest*, as well as the collaboration, *Pericles, Prince of Tyre*. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.[150] Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day.[151][152][153] Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, *Henry VIII* and *The Two Noble Kinsmen*, probably with John Fletcher.[154]\n\n\n\n### Classification[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chronology of Shakespeare's plays\n\n![](image)*The Plays of William Shakespeare*, a painting containing scenes and characters from several plays of Shakespeare; by Sir John Gilbert, c. 1849\nShakespeare's works include the 36 plays printed in the First Folio of 1623, listed according to their folio classification as comedies, histories, and tragedies.[155] Two plays not included in the First Folio,[12] *The Two Noble Kinsmen* and *Pericles, Prince of Tyre*, are now accepted as part of the canon, with today's scholars agreeing that Shakespeare made major contributions to the writing of both.[156][157] No Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio.\n\n\nIn the late 19th century, Edward Dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances, and though many scholars prefer to call them *tragicomedies*, Dowden's term is often used.[158][159] In 1896, Frederick S. Boas coined the term \"problem plays\" to describe four plays: *All's Well That Ends Well*, *Measure for Measure*, *Troilus and Cressida,* and *Hamlet*.[160] \"Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies\", he wrote. \"We may, therefore, borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeare's problem plays.\"[161] The term, much debated and sometimes applied to other plays, remains in use, though *Hamlet* is definitively classed as a tragedy.[162][163][164]\n\n\n\n### Performances[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shakespeare in performance\n\nIt is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays. The title page of the 1594 edition of *Titus Andronicus* reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes.[165] After the plagues of 1592–93, Shakespeare's plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch, north of the Thames.[166] Londoners flocked there to see the first part of *Henry IV*, Leonard Digges recording, \"Let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest ... and you scarce shall have a room\".[167] When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark.[168][169] The Globe opened in autumn 1599, with *Julius Caesar* one of the first plays staged. Most of Shakespeare's greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe, including *Hamlet*, *Othello,* and *King Lear*.[168][170][171]\n\n\n\n![](image)The reconstructed Globe Theatre on the south bank of the River Thames in London\nAfter the Lord Chamberlain's Men were renamed the King's Men in 1603, they entered a special relationship with the new King James. Although the performance records are patchy, the King's Men performed seven of Shakespeare's plays at court between 1 November 1604, and 31 October 1605, including two performances of *The Merchant of Venice*.[61] After 1608, they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer.[172] The indoor setting, combined with the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques, allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. In *Cymbeline*, for example, Jupiter descends \"in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees.\"[173][174]\n\n\nThe actors in Shakespeare's company included the famous Richard Burbage, William Kempe, Henry Condell and John Heminges. Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including *Richard III*, *Hamlet*, *Othello*, and *King Lear*.[175] The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in *Romeo and Juliet* and Dogberry in *Much Ado About Nothing*, among other characters.[176][177] He was replaced around 1600 by Robert Armin, who played roles such as Touchstone in *As You Like It* and the fool in *King Lear*.[178] In 1613, Sir Henry Wotton recorded that *Henry VIII* \"was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony\".[179] On 29 June, however, a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe and burned the theatre to the ground, an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision.[179]\n\n\n\n\n### Textual sources[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Title page of the *First Folio*, 1623. Copper engraving of Shakespeare by Martin Droeshout.\nIn 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two of Shakespeare's friends from the King's Men, published the First Folio, a collected edition of Shakespeare's plays. It contained 36 texts, including 18 printed for the first time.[180] The others had already appeared in quarto versions—flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves.[181] No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions, which the First Folio describes as \"stol'n and surreptitious copies\".[182]\n\n\nAlfred Pollard termed some of the pre-1623 versions as \"bad quartos\" because of their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory.[181][182][183] Where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the other. The differences may stem from copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from Shakespeare's own papers.[184][185] In some cases, for example, *Hamlet*, *Troilus and Cressida,* and *Othello*, Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. In the case of *King Lear*, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto that the *Oxford Shakespeare* prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.[186]\n\n\n\n## Poems[edit]\n\n\nIn 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare published two narrative poems on sexual themes, *Venus and Adonis* and *The Rape of Lucrece*. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In *Venus and Adonis*, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in *The Rape of Lucrece*, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin.[187] Influenced by Ovid's *Metamorphoses*,[188] the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust.[189] Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, *A Lover's Complaint*, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the *Sonnets* in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote *A Lover's Complaint*. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects.[190][191][192] *The Phoenix and the Turtle*, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 *Love's Martyr*, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in *The Passionate Pilgrim*, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission.[190][192][193]\n\n\n\n### Sonnets[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shakespeare's sonnets\n\n![](image)Title page from 1609 edition of *Shake-Speares Sonnets*\nPublished in 1609, the *Sonnets* were the last of Shakespeare's non-dramatic works to be printed. Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership.[194][195] Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in *The Passionate Pilgrim* in 1599, Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare's \"sugred Sonnets among his private friends\".[196] Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare's intended sequence.[197] He seems to have planned two contrasting series: one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion (the \"dark lady\"), and one about conflicted love for a fair young man (the \"fair youth\"). It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial \"I\" who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself, though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets \"Shakespeare unlocked his heart\".[196][195]\n\n\n\n> \n> Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?  \n> \n> Thou art more lovely and more temperate ...\n> \n> \n\n\n—Opening lines from Shakespeare's *Sonnet 18*.[198]\n\nThe 1609 edition was dedicated to a \"Mr. W.H.\", credited as \"the only begetter\" of the poems. It is not known whether this was written by Shakespeare himself or by the publisher, Thomas Thorpe, whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page; nor is it known who Mr. W.H. was, despite numerous theories, or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication.[199] Critics praise the *Sonnets* as a profound meditation on the nature of love, sexual passion, procreation, death, and time.[200]\n\n\n\n## Style[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shakespeare's writing style\n\nShakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama.[201] The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in *Titus Andronicus*, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in *The Two Gentlemen of Verona* has been described as stilted.[202][203]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Pity* by William Blake, 1795, is an illustration of two similes in *Macbeth*:\"And pity, like a naked new-born babe,  \n\nStriding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd  \n\nUpon the sightless couriers of the air.\"[204]\n\nHowever, Shakespeare soon began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of *Richard III* has its roots in the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays.[205][206] No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with *Romeo and Juliet* perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles.[207] By the time of *Romeo and Juliet*, *Richard II*, and *A Midsummer Night's Dream* in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.\n\n\nShakespeare's standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony.[208] Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as *Julius Caesar* and *Hamlet*. Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind:[209]\n\n\n\n\n> Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting  \n> \n> That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay  \n> \n> Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly—  \n> \n> And prais'd be rashness for it—let us know  \n> \n> Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well ...\n> \n> — *Hamlet*, Act 5, Scene 2, 4–8[209]\n> \n\n\nAfter *Hamlet*, Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as \"more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical\".[210] In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length.[211] In *Macbeth*, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: \"was the hope drunk/ Wherein you dressed yourself?\" (1.7.35–38); \"... pity, like a naked new-born babe/ Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air ...\" (1.7.21–25). The listener is challenged to complete the sense.[211] The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.[212]\n\n\nShakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre.[213] Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed.[214] He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting, and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama.[215] As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In Shakespeare's late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.[216][217]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Influence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shakespeare's influence\n\n![](image)*Macbeth Consulting the Vision of the Armed Head*. By Henry Fuseli, 1793–1794.\nShakespeare's work has made a significant and lasting impression on later theatre and literature. In particular, he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation, plot, language, and genre.[218] Until *Romeo and Juliet*, for example, romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy.[219] Soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events, but Shakespeare used them to explore characters' minds.[220] His work heavily influenced later poetry. The Romantic poets attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama, though with little success. Critic George Steiner described all English verse dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson as \"feeble variations on Shakespearean themes.\"[221] John Milton, considered by many to be the most important English poet after Shakespeare, wrote in tribute: \"Thou in our wonder and astonishment/ Has built thyself a live-long monument.\"[222]\n\n\nShakespeare influenced novelists such as Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melville's soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in *Moby-Dick* is a classic tragic hero, inspired by *King Lear*.[223] Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare's works. These include three operas by Giuseppe Verdi, *Macbeth*, *Otello* and *Falstaff*, whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays.[224] Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites, while William Hogarth's 1745 painting of actor David Garrick playing Richard III was decisive in establishing the genre of theatrical portraiture in Britain.[225] The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli, a friend of William Blake, even translated *Macbeth* into German.[226] The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology, in particular, that of Hamlet, for his theories of human nature.[227] Shakespeare has been a rich source for filmmakers; Akira Kurosawa adapted *Macbeth* and *King Lear* as *Throne of Blood* and *Ran*, respectively. Other examples of Shakespeare on film include Max Reinhardt's *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, Laurence Olivier's *Hamlet* and Al Pacino's documentary *Looking For Richard*.[228] Orson Welles, a lifelong lover of Shakespeare, directed and starred in films of *Macbeth* and *Othello*, and *Chimes at Midnight*, in which he plays John Falstaff, which Welles himself called his best work.[229]\n\n\nIn Shakespeare's day, English grammar, spelling, and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now,[230] and his use of language helped shape modern English.[231] Samuel Johnson quoted him more often than any other author in his *A Dictionary of the English Language*, the first serious work of its type.[232] Expressions such as \"with bated breath\" (*Merchant of Venice*) and \"a foregone conclusion\" (*Othello*) have found their way into everyday English speech.[233][234]\n\n\nShakespeare's influence extends far beyond his native England and the English language. His reception in Germany was particularly significant; as early as the 18th century Shakespeare was widely translated and popularised in Germany, and gradually became a \"classic of the German Weimar era;\" Christoph Martin Wieland was the first to produce complete translations of Shakespeare's plays in any language.[235][236] Actor and theatre director Simon Callow writes, \"this master, this titan, this genius, so profoundly British and so effortlessly universal, each different culture – German, Italian, Russian – was obliged to respond to the Shakespearean example; for the most part, they embraced it, and him, with joyous abandon, as the possibilities of language and character in action that he celebrated liberated writers across the continent. Some of the most deeply affecting productions of Shakespeare have been non-English, and non-European. He is that unique writer: he has something for everyone.\"[237]\n\n\nAccording to *Guinness World Records*, Shakespeare remains the world's best-selling playwright, with sales of his plays and poetry believed to have achieved in excess of four billion copies in the almost 400 years since his death. He is also the third most translated author in history.[238]\n\n\n\n### Critical reputation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Reputation of William Shakespeare and Timeline of Shakespeare criticism\n\n> \n> He was not of an age, but for all time.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Ben Jonson[239]\n\nShakespeare was not revered in his lifetime, but he received a large amount of praise.[240][241] In 1598, the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out from a group of English playwrights as \"the most excellent\" in both comedy and tragedy.[242][243] The authors of the *Parnassus* plays at St John's College, Cambridge, numbered him with Chaucer, Gower, and Spenser.[244] In the First Folio, Ben Jonson called Shakespeare the \"Soul of the age, the applause, delight, the wonder of our stage\", although he had remarked elsewhere that \"Shakespeare wanted art\" (lacked skill).[239]\n\n\nBetween the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century, classical ideas were in vogue. As a result, critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson.[245] Thomas Rymer, for example, condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic. Nevertheless, poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly, saying of Jonson, \"I admire him, but I love Shakespeare\".[246] He also famously remarked that Shakespeare \"was naturally learned; he needed not the spectacles of books to read nature; he looked inwards, and found her there.\"[247] For several decades, Rymer's view held sway. But during the 18th century, critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and, like Dryden, to acclaim what they termed his natural genius. A series of scholarly editions of his work, notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790, added to his growing reputation.[248][249] By 1800, he was firmly enshrined as the national poet,[250] and described as the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"the Bard\").[251][h] In the 18th and 19th centuries, his reputation also spread abroad. Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire, Goethe, Stendhal, and Victor Hugo.[253][i]\n\n\n\n![](image)William Ordway Partridge's garlanded statue of William Shakespeare in Lincoln Park, Chicago, typical of many created in the 19th and early 20th centuries\nDuring the Romantic era, Shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and the critic August Wilhelm Schlegel translated his plays in the spirit of German Romanticism.[255] In the 19th century, critical admiration for Shakespeare's genius often bordered on adulation.[256] \"This King Shakespeare,\" the essayist Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1840, \"does not he shine, in crowned sovereignty, over us all, as the noblest, gentlest, yet strongest of rallying signs; indestructible\".[257] The Victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale.[258] The playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw mocked the cult of Shakespeare worship as \"bardolatry\", claiming that the new naturalism of Ibsen's plays had made Shakespeare obsolete.[259]\n\n\nThe modernist revolution in the arts during the early 20th century, far from discarding Shakespeare, eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the avant-garde. The Expressionists in Germany and the Futurists in Moscow mounted productions of his plays. Marxist playwright and director Bertolt Brecht devised an epic theatre under the influence of Shakespeare. The poet and critic T. S. Eliot argued against Shaw that Shakespeare's \"primitiveness\" in fact made him truly modern.[260] Eliot, along with G. Wilson Knight and the school of New Criticism, led a movement towards a closer reading of Shakespeare's imagery. In the 1950s, a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for post-modern studies of Shakespeare.[261] By the 1980s, Shakespeare studies were open to movements such as structuralism, feminism, New Historicism, African-American studies, and queer studies.[262][263] Comparing Shakespeare's accomplishments to those of leading figures in philosophy and theology, Harold Bloom wrote, \"Shakespeare was larger than Plato and than St. Augustine. He *encloses* us because we *see* with his fundamental perceptions.\"[264]\n\n\n\n## Speculation[edit]\n\n\n### Authorship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shakespeare authorship question\n\nAround 230 years after Shakespeare's death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him.[265] Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.[266] Several \"group theories\" have also been proposed.[267] All but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe theory, with only a small minority of academics who believe that there is reason to question the traditional attribution,[268] but interest in the subject, particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, continues into the 21st century.[269][270][271]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religious views of William Shakespeare\n\nShakespeare conformed to the official state religion,[j] but his private views on religion have been the subject of debate. Shakespeare's will uses a Protestant formula, and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England, where he was married, his children were baptised, and where he is buried. Some scholars claim that members of Shakespeare's family were Catholics, at a time when practising Catholicism in England was against the law.[273] Shakespeare's mother, Mary Arden, certainly came from a pious Catholic family. The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by his father, John Shakespeare, found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street. However, the document is now lost and scholars differ as to its authenticity.[274][275] In 1591, the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church \"for fear of process for debt\", a common Catholic excuse.[276][277][278] In 1606, the name of William's daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford.[276][277][278] Other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about Shakespeare's religious beliefs. Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare's Catholicism, Protestantism, or lack of belief in his plays, but the truth may be impossible to prove.[279][280]\n\n\n\n### Sexuality[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sexuality of William Shakespeare\n\nFew details of Shakespeare's sexuality are known. At 18, he married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway, who was pregnant. Susanna, the first of their three children, was born six months later on 26 May 1583. Over the centuries, some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical,[281] and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love.[282][283][284] The 26 so-called \"Dark Lady\" sonnets, addressed to a married woman, are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons.[285]\n\n\n\n### Portraiture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Portraits of Shakespeare\n\nNo written contemporary description of Shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait, so the Droeshout engraving, which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness,[286] and his Stratford monument provide perhaps the best evidence of his appearance. From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led to the production of several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, repaintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people.[287]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of William Shakespeare\n* English Renaissance theatre\n* Spelling of Shakespeare's name\n* *World Shakespeare Bibliography*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The concept that Shakespeare was born on 23 April, contrary to belief, is a tradition, and not a fact;[1] see § Early life below.\n2. **^** Dates follow the Julian calendar, used in England throughout Shakespeare's lifespan, but with the start of the year adjusted to 1 January (see Old Style and New Style dates). Under the Gregorian calendar, adopted in Catholic countries in 1582, Shakespeare died on 3 May.[2]\n3. **^** The crest is a silver falcon supporting a spear, while the motto is *Non Sanz Droict* (French for \"not without right\").

In addition to presenting the town with a statue of Shakespeare, Garrick composed a doggerel verse, lampooned in the London newspapers, naming the banks of the Avon as the birthplace of the \"matchless Bard\".[252]\n9. **^** Grady cites Voltaire's *Philosophical Letters* (1733); Goethe's *Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship* (1795); Stendhal's two-part pamphlet *Racine et Shakespeare* (1823–25); and Victor Hugo's prefaces to *Cromwell* (1827) and *William Shakespeare* (1864).[254]\n10. **^** For example, A.L. Rowse, the 20th-century Shakespeare scholar, was emphatic: \"He died, as he had lived, a conforming member of the Church of England. His will made that perfectly clear—in facts, puts it beyond dispute, for it uses the Protestant formula.\"[272]\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Schoenbaum 1987, pp. 24–26.\n2. **^**

Her books are still enormously popular and have been translated into ninety languages. As of June 2019, Blyton held 4th place for the most translated author. She wrote on a wide range of topics, including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives. She is best remembered today for her *Noddy*, *Famous Five*, *Secret Seven*, the *Five Find-Outers*, and *Malory Towers* books, although she also wrote many others, including the *St. Clare's*, *The Naughtiest Girl*, and *The Faraway Tree* series.\n\n\nHer first book, *Child Whispers*, a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922. Following the commercial success of her early novels, such as *Adventures of the Wishing-Chair* (1937) and *The Enchanted Wood* (1939), Blyton went on to build a literary empire, sometimes producing fifty books a year in addition to her prolific magazine and newspaper contributions. Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind; she typed her stories as events unfolded before her. The sheer volume of her work and the speed with which she produced it led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers, a charge she vigorously denied.\n\n\nBlyton's work became increasingly controversial among literary critics, teachers, and parents beginning in the 1950s due to the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and her themes, particularly in the Noddy series. Some libraries and schools banned her works, and from the 1930s until the 1950s, the BBC refused to broadcast her stories because of their perceived lack of literary merit. Her books have been criticised as elitist, sexist, racist, xenophobic, and at odds with the more progressive environment that was emerging in post-World War II Britain, but they have continued to be bestsellers since her death in 1968.\n\n\nShe felt she had a responsibility to provide her readers with a strong moral framework, so she encouraged them to support worthy causes. In particular, through the clubs she set up or supported, she encouraged and organised them to raise funds for animal and paediatric charities.\n\n\nThe story of Blyton's life was dramatised in *Enid*, a BBC television film featuring Helena Bonham Carter in the title role. It was first broadcast in the UK on BBC Four in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nEnid Blyton was born on 11 August 1897 in East Dulwich, South London, United Kingdom, the eldest of three children, to Thomas Carey Blyton (1870–1920), a cutlery salesman (recorded in the 1911 census with the occupation of \"Mantle Manufacturer dealer [in] women's suits, skirts, etc.\") and his wife Theresa Mary (*née* Harrison; 1874–1950). Enid's younger brothers, Hanly (1899–1983) and Carey (1902–1976), were born after the family had moved to a semi-detached house in Beckenham, then a village in Kent.[1] A few months after her birth, Enid almost died from whooping cough, but was nursed back to health by her father, whom she adored.[2] Thomas Blyton ignited Enid's interest in nature; in her autobiography she wrote that he \"loved flowers and birds and wild animals, and knew more about them than anyone I had ever met\".[3] He also passed on his interest in gardening, art, music, literature, and theatre, and the pair often went on nature walks, much to the disapproval of Enid's mother, who showed little interest in her daughter's pursuits.[4] Enid was devastated when her father left the family shortly after her 13th birthday to live with another woman. Enid and her mother did not have a good relationship, and Enid did not attend either of her parents' funerals.[5]\n\n\nFrom 1907 to 1915, Blyton attended St Christopher's School in Beckenham, where she enjoyed physical activities and became school tennis champion and lacrosse captain.[6] She was not keen on all the academic subjects, but excelled in writing and, in 1911, entered Arthur Mee's children's poetry competition. Mee offered to print her verses, encouraging her to produce more.[1] Blyton's mother considered her efforts at writing to be a \"waste of time and money\", but she was encouraged to persevere by Mabel Attenborough, the aunt of school friend Mary Potter.[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)Seckford Hall in Woodbridge, Suffolk, was an inspiration to Blyton with its haunted room, secret passageway, and sprawling gardens.\nBlyton's father taught her to play the piano, which she mastered well enough for him to believe she might follow in his sister's footsteps and become a professional musician.[6] Blyton considered enrolling at the Guildhall School of Music, but decided she was better suited to becoming a writer.[7] After finishing school, in 1915, as head girl, she moved out of the family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before going to stay with George and Emily Hunt at Seckford Hall, near Woodbridge, in Suffolk. Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway, provided inspiration for her later writing.[1] At Woodbridge Congregational Church, Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at Ipswich High School and suggested she train there as a teacher.[8][9] Blyton was introduced to the children at the nursery school and, recognising her natural affinity with them, enrolled in a National Froebel Union teacher training course at the school in September 1916.[7][10] By this time, she had nearly terminated all contact with her family.[1]\n\n\nBlyton's manuscripts were rejected by publishers on many occasions, which only made her more determined to succeed, saying, \"it is partly the struggle that helps you so much, that gives you determination, character, self-reliance –all things that help in any profession or trade, and most certainly in writing.\" In March 1916, her first poems were published in *Nash's Magazine*.[11] She completed her teacher training course in December 1918 and, the following month, obtained a teaching appointment at Bickley Park School, a small, independent establishment for boys in Bickley, Kent. Two months later, Blyton received a teaching certificate with distinctions in zoology and principles of education; first class in botany, geography, practice and history of education, child hygiene, and classroom teaching; and second class in literature and elementary mathematics.[1] In 1920, she moved to Southernhay, in Hook Road Surbiton, as nursery governess to the four sons of architect Horace Thompson and his wife Gertrude,[7] with whom Blyton spent four happy years. With the shortage of area schools, neighbouring children soon joined her charges, and a small school developed at the house.[12]\n\n\n\n## Early writing career[edit]\n\n\nFurther information on works by Enid Blyton: Enid Blyton bibliography\n\nIn 1920, Blyton moved to Chessington and began writing in her spare time. The following year, she won the *Saturday Westminster Review* writing competition with her essay \"On the Popular Fallacy that to the Pure All Things are Pure\".[13] Publications such as *The Londoner*, *Home Weekly* and *The Bystander* began to show an interest in her short stories and poems.[1]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Child Whispers* (1922)\nBlyton's first book, *Child Whispers*, a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922.[13] Its illustrator, Enid's schoolfriend Phyllis Chase collaborated on several of her early works.[14] Also in that year, Blyton began writing in annuals for Cassell and George Newnes, and her first piece of writing, \"Peronel and his Pot of Glue\", was accepted for publication in *Teachers' World*. Further boosting her success, in 1923, her poems appeared alongside those of Rudyard Kipling, Walter de la Mare, and G. K. Chesterton in a special issue of *Teachers' World.* Blyton's educational texts were influential in the 1920s and 1930s, with her most sizable being the three-volume *The Teacher's Treasury* (1926), the six-volume *Modern Teaching* (1928), the eight-volume *Pictorial Knowledge* (1930), and the four-volume *Modern Teaching in the Infant School* (1932).[15]\n\n\nIn July 1923, Blyton published *Real Fairies*, a collection of thirty-three poems written especially for the book with the exception of \"Pretending\", which had appeared earlier in *Punch* magazine.[16] The following year, she published *The Enid Blyton Book of Fairies*, illustrated by Horace J. Knowles,[17] and in 1926 the *Book of Brownies*.[18] Several books of plays appeared in 1927, including *A Book of Little Plays* and *The Play's the Thing* with the illustrator Alfred Bestall.[19]\n\n\nIn the 1930s, Blyton developed an interest in writing stories related to various myths, including those of ancient Greece and Rome; *The Knights of the Round Table*, *Tales of Ancient Greece* and *Tales of Robin Hood* were published in 1930. In *Tales of Ancient Greece* Blyton retold 16 well-known ancient Greek myths, but used the Latin rather than the Greek names and invented conversations between characters.[20] *The Adventures of Odysseus*, *Tales of the Ancient Greeks and Persians* and *Tales of the Romans* followed in 1934.[21]\n\n\n\n## Commercial success[edit]\n\n\n### New series: 1934–1948[edit]\n\n\nThe first of twenty-eight books in Blyton's Old Thatch series, *The Talking Teapot and Other Tales*, was published in 1934, the same year as *Brer Rabbit Retold*;[22] (note that Brer Rabbit originally featured in Uncle Remus stories by Joel Chandler Harris), her first serial story and first full-length book, *Adventures of the Wishing-Chair*, followed in 1937. *The Enchanted Wood*, the first book in the Faraway Tree series, published in 1939, is about a magic tree inspired by the Norse mythology that had fascinated Blyton as a child.[7] According to Blyton's daughter Gillian the inspiration for the magic tree came from \"thinking up a story one day and suddenly she was walking in the enchanted wood and found the tree. In her imagination she climbed up through the branches and met Moon-Face, Silky, the Saucepan Man and the rest of the characters. She had all she needed.\"[23] As in the Wishing-Chair series, these fantasy books typically involve children being transported into a magical world in which they meet fairies, goblins, elves, pixies and other mythological creatures.\n\n\nBlyton's first full-length adventure novel, *The Secret Island*, was published in 1938, featuring the characters of Jack, Mike, Peggy and Nora.[24] Described by *The Glasgow Herald* as a \"Robinson Crusoe-style adventure on an island in an English lake\", *The Secret Island* was a lifelong favourite of Gillian's and spawned the Secret series.[23] The following year Blyton released her first book in the Circus series[25] and her initial book in the Amelia Jane series, *Naughty Amelia Jane!*[26] According to Gillian the main character was based on a large handmade doll given to her by her mother on her third birthday.[23]\n\n\nDuring the 1940s Blyton became a prolific author, her success enhanced by her \"marketing, publicity and branding that was far ahead of its time\".[27] In 1940 Blyton published two books – *Three Boys and a Circus* and *Children of Kidillin* – under the pseudonym of Mary Pollock (middle name plus first married name),[28] in addition to the eleven published under her own name that year. So popular were Pollock's books that one reviewer was prompted to observe that \"Enid Blyton had better look to her laurels\".[29] But Blyton's readers were not so easily deceived and many complained about the subterfuge to her and her publisher,[29] with the result that all six books published under the name of Mary Pollock – two in 1940 and four in 1943 – were reissued under Blyton's name.[30] Later in 1940 Blyton published the first of her boarding school story books and the first novel in the Naughtiest Girl series, *The Naughtiest Girl in the School*, which followed the exploits of the mischievous schoolgirl Elizabeth Allen at the fictional Whyteleafe School. The first of her six novels in the St. Clare's series, *The Twins at St. Clare's*, appeared the following year, featuring the twin sisters Patricia and Isabel O'Sullivan.[15]\n\n\nIn 1942 Blyton released the first book in the Mary Mouse series, *Mary Mouse and the Dolls' House*, about a mouse exiled from her mousehole who becomes a maid at a dolls' house. Twenty-three books in the series were produced between 1942 and 1964; 10,000 copies were sold in 1942 alone.[31] The same year, Blyton published the first novel in the Famous Five series, *Five on a Treasure Island*, with illustrations by Eileen Soper. Its popularity resulted in twenty-one books between then and 1963, and the characters of Julian, Dick, Anne, George (Georgina) and Timmy the dog became household names in Britain.[32] Matthew Grenby, author of *Children's Literature*, states that the five were involved with \"unmasking hardened villains and solving serious crimes\", although the novels were \"hardly 'hard-boiled' thrillers\".[33] Blyton based the character of Georgina, a tomboy she described as \"short-haired, freckled, sturdy, and snub-nosed\" and \"bold and daring, hot-tempered and loyal\", on herself.[11]\n\n\nBlyton had an interest in biblical narratives, and retold Old and New Testament stories. *The Land of Far-Beyond* (1942) is a Christian parable along the lines of John Bunyan's *The Pilgrim's Progress* (1698), with contemporary children as the main characters.[34] In 1943 she published *The Children's Life of Christ*, a collection of fifty-nine short stories related to the life of Jesus, with her own slant on popular biblical stories, from the Nativity and the Three Wise Men through to the trial, the crucifixion and the resurrection.[35] *Tales from the Bible* was published the following year,[36] followed by *The Boy with the Loaves and Fishes* in 1948.[37]\n\n\nThe first book in Blyton's Five Find-Outers series, *The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage*, was published in 1943, as was the second book in the Faraway series, *The Magic Faraway Tree*, which in 2003 was voted 66th in the BBC's Big Read poll to find the UK's favourite book.[38] Several of Blyton's works during this period have seaside themes; *John Jolly by the Sea* (1943), a picture book intended for younger readers, was published in a booklet format by Evans Brothers.[39] Other books with a maritime theme include *The Secret of Cliff Castle* and *Smuggler Ben*, both attributed to Mary Pollock in 1943;[40] *The Island of Adventure*, the first in the Adventure series of eight novels from 1944 onwards;[41] and various novels of the Famous Five series such as *Five on a Treasure Island* (1942),[42] *Five on Kirrin Island Again* (1947)[43] and *Five Go Down to the Sea* (1953).[44]\n\n\nCapitalising on her success, with a loyal and ever-growing readership,[15] Blyton produced a new edition of many of her series such as the Famous Five, the Five Find-Outers and St. Clare's every year in addition to many other novels, short stories and books. In 1946 Blyton launched the first in the Malory Towers series of six books based around the schoolgirl Darrell Rivers, *First Term at Malory Towers*, which became extremely popular, particularly with girls.[45]\n\n\n\n### Peak output: 1949–1959[edit]\n\n\nThe first book in Blyton's Barney Mysteries series, *The Rockingdown Mystery*, was published in 1949,[46] as was the first of her fifteen Secret Seven novels.[47] The Secret Seven Society consists of Peter, his sister Janet, and their friends Colin, George, Jack, Pam and Barbara, who meet regularly in a shed in the garden to discuss peculiar events in their local community. Blyton rewrote the stories so they could be adapted into cartoons, which appeared in *Mickey Mouse Weekly* in 1951 with illustrations by George Brook. The French author Evelyne Lallemand continued the series in the 1970s, producing an additional twelve books, nine of which were translated into English by Anthea Bell between 1983 and 1987.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blyton's characters Noddy and Big Ears\nBlyton's Noddy, about a little wooden boy from Toyland, first appeared in the *Sunday Graphic* on 5 June 1949, and in November that year *Noddy Goes to Toyland*, the first of at least two dozen books in the series, was published. The idea was conceived by one of Blyton's publishers, Sampson, Low, Marston and Company, who in 1949 arranged a meeting between Blyton and the Dutch illustrator Harmsen van der Beek. Despite having to communicate via an interpreter, he provided some initial sketches of how Toyland and its characters would be represented. Four days after the meeting Blyton sent the text of the first two Noddy books to her publisher, to be forwarded to van der Beek.[49] The Noddy books became one of her most successful and best-known series, and were hugely popular in the 1950s.[50] An extensive range of sub-series, spin-offs and strip books were produced throughout the decade, including *Noddy's Library*, *Noddy's Garage of Books*, *Noddy's Castle of Books*, *Noddy's Toy Station of Books* and *Noddy's Shop of Books*.[51]\n\n\nIn 1950 Blyton established the company Darrell Waters Ltd to manage her affairs. By the early 1950s she had reached the peak of her output, often publishing more than fifty books a year, and she remained extremely prolific throughout much of the decade.[52] By 1955 Blyton had written her fourteenth Famous Five novel, *Five Have Plenty of Fun*, her fifteenth Mary Mouse book, *Mary Mouse in Nursery Rhyme Land*, her eighth book in the Adventure series, *The River of Adventure*, and her seventh Secret Seven novel, *Secret Seven Win Through*. She completed the sixth and final book of the Malory Towers series, *Last Term at Malory Towers*, in 1951.[45]\n\n\nBlyton published several further books featuring the character of Scamp the terrier, following on from *The Adventures of Scamp*, a novel she had released in 1943 under the pseudonym of Mary Pollock.[53] *Scamp Goes on Holiday* (1952) and *Scamp and Bimbo*, *Scamp at School*, *Scamp and Caroline* and *Scamp Goes to the Zoo* (1954) were illustrated by Pierre Probst. She introduced the character of Bom, a stylish toy drummer dressed in a bright red coat and helmet, alongside Noddy in *TV Comic* in July 1956.[54] A book series began the same year with *Bom the Little Toy Drummer*, featuring illustrations by R. Paul-Hoye,[55] and followed with *Bom and His Magic Drumstick* (1957), *Bom Goes Adventuring* and *Bom Goes to Ho Ho Village* (1958), *Bom and the Clown* and *Bom and the Rainbow* (1959) and *Bom Goes to Magic Town* (1960). In 1958 she produced two annuals featuring the character, the first of which included twenty short stories, poems and picture strips.[56]\n\n\n\n### Final works[edit]\n\n\nMany of Blyton's series, including Noddy and The Famous Five, continued to be successful in the 1960s; by 1962, 26 million copies of Noddy had been sold.[1][a] Blyton concluded several of her long-running series in 1963, publishing the last books of The Famous Five (*Five Are Together Again*) and The Secret Seven (*Fun for the Secret Seven*); she also produced three more Brer Rabbit books with the illustrator Grace Lodge: *Brer Rabbit Again*, *Brer Rabbit Book*, and *Brer Rabbit's a Rascal*. In 1962 many of her books were among the first to be published by Armada Books in paperback, making them more affordable to children.[1]\n\n\nAfter 1963 Blyton's output was generally confined to short stories and books intended for very young readers, such as *Learn to Count with Noddy* and *Learn to Tell Time with Noddy* in 1965, and *Stories for Bedtime* and the Sunshine Picture Story Book collection in 1966. Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend.[57] Blyton published her last book in the Noddy series, *Noddy and the Aeroplane*, in February 1964. In May the following year she published *Mixed Bag*, a song book with music written by her nephew Carey, and in August she released her last full-length books, *The Man Who Stopped to Help* and *The Boy Who Came Back*.[1]\n\n\n\n## Magazine and newspaper contributions[edit]\n\n\nBlyton cemented her reputation as a children's writer when in 1926 she took over the editing of *Sunny Stories*, a magazine that typically included the re-telling of legends, myths, stories and other articles for children.[7] That same year she was given her own column in *Teachers' World*, entitled \"From my Window\". Three years later she began contributing a weekly page in the magazine, in which she published letters from her fox terrier dog Bobs.[1] They proved to be so popular that in 1933 they were published in book form as *Letters from Bobs*,[58] and sold ten thousand copies in the first week.[1] Her most popular feature was \"Round the Year with Enid Blyton\", which consisted of forty-eight articles covering aspects of natural history such as weather, pond life, how to plant a school garden and how to make a bird table.[59] Among Blyton's other nature projects was her monthly \"Country Letter\" feature that appeared in *The Nature Lover* magazine in 1935.[60]\n\n\n*Sunny Stories* was renamed *Enid Blyton's Sunny Stories* in January 1937, and served as a vehicle for the serialisation of Blyton's books. Her first Naughty Amelia Jane story, about an anti-heroine based on a doll owned by her daughter Gillian,[61] was published in the magazine.[1] Blyton stopped contributing in 1952, and it closed down the following year, shortly before the appearance of the new fortnightly *Enid Blyton Magazine* written entirely by Blyton.[62] The first edition appeared on 18 March 1953,[63] and the magazine ran until September 1959.[7]\n\n\nNoddy made his first appearance in the *Sunday Graphic* in 1949, the same year as Blyton's first daily Noddy strip for the London *Evening Standard*.[1] It was illustrated by van der Beek until his death in 1953.[1][64]\n\n\n\n## Writing style and technique[edit]\n\n\nBlyton worked in a wide range of fictional genres, from fairy tales to animal, nature, detective, mystery, and circus stories, but she often \"blurred the boundaries\" in her books, and encompassed a range of genres even in her short stories.[65] In a 1958 article published in *The Author*, she wrote that there were a \"dozen or more different types of stories for children\", and she had tried them all, but her favourites were those with a family at their centre.[66]\n\n\nIn a letter to the psychologist Peter McKellar,[b] Blyton describes her writing technique:\n\n\n\n\n> I shut my eyes for a few minutes, with my portable typewriter on my knee – I make my mind a blank and wait – and then, as clearly as I would see real children, my characters stand before me in my mind's eye ... The first sentence comes straight into my mind, I don't have to think of it – I don't have to think of anything.[68]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn another letter to McKellar she describes how in just five days she wrote the 60,000-word book *The River of Adventure*, the eighth in her Adventure Series,[69] by listening to what she referred to as her \"under-mind\",[70] which she contrasted with her \"upper conscious mind\".[71] Blyton was unwilling to conduct any research or planning before beginning work on a new book, which coupled with the lack of variety in her life[c] according to Druce almost inevitably presented the danger that she might unconsciously, and clearly did, plagiarise the books she had read, including her own.[72] Gillian has recalled that her mother \"never knew where her stories came from\", but that she used to talk about them \"coming from her 'mind's eye'\", as did William Wordsworth and Charles Dickens. Blyton had \"thought it was made up of every experience she'd ever had, everything she's seen or heard or read, much of which had long disappeared from her conscious memory\" but never knew the direction her stories would take. Blyton further explained in her biography that \"If I tried to think out or invent the whole book, I could not do it. For one thing, it would bore me and for another, it would lack the 'verve' and the extraordinary touches and surprising ideas that flood out from my imagination.\"[23]\n\n\nBlyton's daily routine varied little over the years. She usually began writing soon after breakfast, with her portable typewriter on her knee and her favourite red Moroccan shawl nearby; she believed that the colour red acted as a \"mental stimulus\" for her. Stopping only for a short lunch break she continued writing until five o'clock, by which time she would usually have produced 6,000–10,000 words.[74]\n\n\nA 2000 article in *The Malay Mail* considers Blyton's children to have \"lived in a world shaped by the realities of post-war austerity\", enjoying freedom without the political correctness of today, which serves modern readers of Blyton's novels with a form of escapism.[75] Brandon Robshaw of *The Independent* refers to the Blyton universe as \"crammed with colour and character\", \"self-contained and internally consistent\", noting that Blyton exemplifies a strong mistrust of adults and figures of authority in her works, creating a world in which children govern.[76] Gillian noted that in her mother's adventure, detective and school stories for older children, \"the hook is the strong storyline with plenty of cliffhangers, a trick she acquired from her years of writing serialised stories for children's magazines. There is always a strong moral framework in which bravery and loyalty are (eventually) rewarded\".[23] Blyton herself wrote that \"my love of children is the whole foundation of all my work\".[77]\n\n\nVictor Watson, Assistant Director of Research at Homerton College, Cambridge, believes that Blyton's works reveal an \"essential longing and potential associated with childhood\", and notes how the opening pages of *The Mountain of Adventure* present a \"deeply appealing ideal of childhood\".[78] He argues that Blyton's work differs from that of many other authors in its approach, describing the narrative of The Famous Five series for instance as \"like a powerful spotlight, it seeks to illuminate, to explain, to demystify. It takes its readers on a roller-coaster story in which the darkness is always banished; everything puzzling, arbitrary, evocative is either dismissed or explained\". Watson further notes how Blyton often used minimalist visual descriptions and introduced a few careless phrases such as \"gleamed enchantingly\" to appeal to her young readers.[79]\n\n\nFrom the mid-1950s rumours began to circulate that Blyton had not written all the books attributed to her, a charge she found particularly distressing. She published an appeal in her magazine asking children to let her know if they heard such stories and, after one mother informed her that she had attended a parents' meeting at her daughter's school during which a young librarian had repeated the allegation,[80] Blyton decided in 1955 to begin legal proceedings.[1] The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year, but the rumours that Blyton operated \"a 'company' of ghost writers\" persisted, as some found it difficult to believe that one woman working alone could produce such a volume of work.[81]\n\n\n\n## Charitable work[edit]\n\n\nBlyton felt a responsibility to provide her readers with a positive moral framework, and she encouraged them to support worthy causes.[82] Her view, expressed in a 1957 article, was that children should help animals and other children rather than adults:\n\n\n\n\n> [children] are not interested in helping adults; indeed, they think that adults themselves should tackle adult needs. But they are intensely interested in animals and other children and feel compassion for the blind boys and girls, and for the spastics who are unable to walk or talk.[83]\n> \n> \n\n\nBlyton and the members of the children's clubs she promoted via her magazines raised a great deal of money for various charities; according to Blyton, membership of her clubs meant \"working for others, for no reward\". The largest of the clubs she was involved with was the Busy Bees, the junior section of the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals, which Blyton had actively supported since 1933. The club had been set up by Maria Dickin in 1934,[84] and after Blyton publicised its existence in the *Enid Blyton Magazine* it attracted 100,000 members in three years.[85] Such was Blyton's popularity among children that after she became Queen Bee in 1952 more than 20,000 additional members were recruited in her first year in office.[84] The Enid Blyton Magazine Club was formed in 1953.[1] Its primary objective was to raise funds to help those children with cerebral palsy who attended a centre in Cheyne Walk, in Chelsea, London, by furnishing an on-site hostel among other things.[86]\n\n\nThe Famous Five series gathered such a following that readers asked Blyton if they might form a fan club. She agreed, on condition that it serve a useful purpose, and suggested that it could raise funds for the Shaftesbury Society Babies' Home[d] in Beaconsfield, on whose committee she had served since 1948.[88] The club was established in 1952, and provided funds for equipping a Famous Five Ward at the home, a paddling pool, sun room, summer house, playground, birthday and Christmas celebrations, and visits to the pantomime.[87] By the late 1950s Blyton's clubs had a membership of 500,000, and raised £35,000 in the six years of the *Enid Blyton Magazine'*s run.[4]\n\n\nBy 1974 the Famous Five Club had a membership of 220,000, and was growing at the rate of 6,000 new members a year.[89][e] The Beaconsfield home it was set up to support closed in 1967, but the club continued to raise funds for other paediatric charities, including an Enid Blyton bed at Great Ormond Street Hospital and a mini-bus for disabled children at Stoke Mandeville Hospital.[91]\n\n\n\n## Jigsaw puzzle and games[edit]\n\n\nBlyton capitalised upon her commercial success as an author by negotiating agreements with jigsaw puzzle and games manufacturers from the late 1940s onwards; by the early 1960s some 146 different companies were involved in merchandising Noddy alone.[92] In 1948 Bestime released four jigsaw puzzles featuring her characters, and the first Enid Blyton board game appeared, *Journey Through Fairyland*, created by BGL. The first card game, Faraway Tree, appeared from Pepys in 1950. In 1954 Bestime released the first four jigsaw puzzles of the Secret Seven, and the following year a Secret Seven card game appeared.[48]\n\n\nBestime released the Little Noddy Car Game in 1953 and the Little Noddy Leap Frog Game in 1955, and in 1956 American manufacturer Parker Brothers released Little Noddy's Taxi Game, a board game which features Noddy driving about town, picking up various characters.[93] Bestime released its Plywood Noddy Jigsaws series in 1957 and a Noddy jigsaw series featuring cards appeared from 1963, with illustrations by Robert Lee. Arrow Games became the chief producer of Noddy jigsaws in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[92] Whitman manufactured four new Secret Seven jigsaw puzzles in 1975, and produced four new Malory Towers ones two years later.[48] In 1979 the company released a Famous Five adventure board game, Famous Five Kirrin Island Treasure.[94] Stephen Thraves wrote eight Famous Five adventure game books, published by Hodder & Stoughton in the 1980s. The first adventure game book of the series, *The Wreckers' Tower Game*, was published in October 1984.[95]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blyton's home \"Old Thatch\" near Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, where she lived from 1929 to 1938\nOn 28 August 1924, Blyton married Major Hugh Alexander Pollock, DSO (1888–1971) at Bromley Register Office, without inviting her family.[1] They married shortly after his divorce from his first wife, with whom he had two sons, one of them already deceased. Pollock was editor of the book department in the publishing firm George Newnes, which became Blyton's regular publisher. It was he who requested her to write a book about animals, resulting in *The Zoo Book*, completed in the month before their marriage.[1] They initially lived in a flat in Chelsea before moving to Elfin Cottage in Beckenham in 1926 and then to Old Thatch in Bourne End (called Peterswood in her books) in 1929.[7][96] Blyton's first daughter, Gillian, was born on 15 July 1931, and, after a miscarriage in 1934,[4] she gave birth to a second daughter, Imogen, on 27 October 1935.[1]\n\n\nIn 1938, she and her family moved to a house in Beaconsfield, named Green Hedges by Blyton's readers, following a competition in her magazine. By the mid-1930s, Pollock had become a secret alcoholic, withdrawing increasingly from public life[97]—possibly triggered through his meetings, as a publisher, with Winston Churchill, which may have reawakened the trauma Pollock suffered during World War I. With the outbreak of World War II, he became involved in the Home Guard[97] and also re-encountered Ida Crowe, an aspiring writer 19 years his junior, whom he had first met years earlier. He made her an offer to join him as secretary in his posting to a Home Guard training center at Denbies, a Gothic mansion in Surrey belonging to Lord Ashcombe, and they began a romantic relationship.[98]\n\n\nBlyton's marriage to Pollock was troubled for years, and according to Crowe's memoir, she had a series of affairs,[98] including a lesbian relationship with one of the children's nannies.[98][99] In 1941, Blyton met Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters, a London surgeon with whom she began a serious affair.[100] Pollock discovered the liaison, and threatened to initiate divorce proceedings.[101] Due to fears that exposure of her adultery would ruin her public image,[98] it was ultimately agreed that Blyton would instead file for divorce against Pollock.[101] According to Crowe's memoir, Blyton promised that if he admitted to infidelity, she would allow him parental access to their daughters; but after the divorce, he was denied contact with them, and Blyton made sure he was subsequently unable to find work in publishing. Pollock, having married Crowe on 26 October 1943, eventually resumed his heavy drinking and was forced to petition for bankruptcy in 1950.[98]\n\n\nBlyton and Darrell Waters married at the City of Westminster Register Office on 20 October 1943. She changed the surname of her daughters to Darrell Waters[102] and publicly embraced her new role as a happily married and devoted doctor's wife.[7] After discovering she was pregnant in the spring of 1945, Blyton miscarried five months later, following a fall from a ladder. The baby would have been Darrell Waters's first child and the son for which they both longed.[4]\n\n\nHer love of tennis included playing naked, with nude tennis \"a common practice in those days among the more louche members of the middle classes\".[103][104]\n\n\nBlyton's health began to deteriorate in 1957, when, during a round of golf, she started to feel faint and breathless,[105] and, by 1960, she was displaying signs of dementia.[106] Her agent, George Greenfield, recalled that it was \"unthinkable\" for the \"most famous and successful of children's authors with her enormous energy and computerlike memory\" to be losing her mind and suffering from what is now known as Alzheimer's disease in her mid-60s.[106] Worsening Blyton's situation was her husband's declining health throughout the 1960s; he suffered from severe arthritis in his neck and hips, deafness, and became increasingly ill-tempered and erratic until his death on 15 September 1967.[100][107]\n\n\nThe story of Blyton's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled *Enid*, which aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Four on 16 November 2009.[108] Helena Bonham Carter, who played the title role, described Blyton as \"a complete workaholic, an achievement junkie and an extremely canny businesswoman\" who \"knew how to brand herself, right down to the famous signature\".[27]\n\n\n\n## Death and legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blue plaque on Blyton's childhood home in Ondine Road, East Dulwich, South London\nDuring the months following her husband's death, Blyton became increasingly ill and moved into a nursing home three months before her death. She died in her sleep of Alzheimer's disease at the Greenways Nursing Home, Hampstead, North London, on 28 November 1968, aged 71. A memorial service was held at St James's Church, Piccadilly[1] and she was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, where her ashes remain. Blyton's home, Green Hedges, was auctioned on 26 May 1971 and demolished in 1973;[109] the site is now occupied by houses and a street named Blyton Close. An English Heritage blue plaque commemorates Blyton at Hook Road in Chessington, where she lived from 1920 to 1924.[110] In 2014, a plaque recording her time as a Beaconsfield resident from 1938 until her death in 1968 was unveiled in the town hall gardens, next to small iron figures of Noddy and Big Ears.[111]\n\n\nSince her death and the publication of her daughter Imogen's 1989 autobiography, *A Childhood at Green Hedges*, Blyton has emerged as an emotionally immature, unstable and often malicious figure.[27] Imogen considered her mother to be \"arrogant, insecure, pretentious, very skilled at putting difficult or unpleasant things out of her mind, and without a trace of maternal instinct. As a child, I viewed her as a rather strict authority. As an adult I pitied her.\"[112] Blyton's eldest daughter Gillian remembered her rather differently however, as \"a fair and loving mother, and a fascinating companion\".[112]\n\n\nThe Enid Blyton Trust for Children was established in 1982, with Imogen as its first chairman,[113] and in 1985 it established the National Library for the Handicapped Child.[7] *Enid Blyton's Adventure Magazine* began publication in September 1985 and, on 14 October 1992, the BBC began publishing *Noddy Magazine* and released the Noddy CD-Rom in October 1996.[1]\n\n\nThe first Enid Blyton Day was held at Rickmansworth on 6 March 1993 and, in October 1996, the Enid Blyton award, The Enid, was given to those who have made outstanding contributions towards children.[1] The Enid Blyton Society was formed in early 1995, to provide \"a focal point for collectors and enthusiasts of Enid Blyton\" through its thrice-annual *Enid Blyton Society Journal*, its annual Enid Blyton Day and its website.[114] On 16 December 1996, Channel 4 broadcast a documentary about Blyton, *Secret Lives*. To celebrate her centenary in 1997, exhibitions were put on at the London Toy & Model Museum (now closed), Hereford and Worcester County Museum and Bromley Library and, on 9 September, the Royal Mail issued centenary stamps.[1]\n\n\nThe London-based entertainment and retail company Trocadero plc purchased Blyton's Darrell Waters Ltd in 1995 for £14.6 million and established a subsidiary, Enid Blyton Ltd, to handle all intellectual properties, character brands and media in Blyton's works.[1][7] The group changed its name to Chorion in 1998 but, after financial difficulties in 2012, sold its assets. Hachette UK acquired from Chorion world rights in the Blyton estate in March 2013, including The Famous Five series[115] but excluding the rights to Noddy, which had been sold to DreamWorks Classics (formerly Classic Media, now a subsidiary of DreamWorks Animation)[116] in 2012.\n\n\nBlyton's granddaughter, Sophie Smallwood, wrote a new Noddy book to celebrate the character's 60th birthday, 46 years after the last book was published; *Noddy and the Farmyard Muddle* (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall.[117] In February 2011, the manuscript of a previously unknown Blyton novel, *Mr Tumpy's Caravan*, was discovered by the archivist at Seven Stories, National Centre for Children's Books in a collection of papers belonging to Blyton's daughter Gillian, purchased by Seven Stories in 2010 following her death.[118][119] It was initially thought to belong to a comic strip collection of the same name published in 1949, but it appears to be unrelated and is believed to be something written in the 1930s, which had been rejected by a publisher.[119][120]\n\n\nIn a 1982 survey of 10,000 eleven-year-old children, Blyton was voted their most popular writer.[1] She is the world's fourth most-translated author, behind Agatha Christie, Jules Verne and William Shakespeare[121] with her books being translated into 90 languages.[122] From 2000 to 2010, Blyton was listed as a Top Ten author, selling almost 8 million copies (worth £31.2 million) in the UK alone.[123] In 2003, *The Magic Faraway Tree* was voted 66th in the BBC's Big Read, a year-long survey of the UK's best-loved novels.[38] In a 2008 poll conducted by the Costa Book Awards, Blyton was voted the UK's best-loved author ahead of Roald Dahl, J. K. Rowling, Jane Austen and Shakespeare.[124][125] Her books continue to be very popular among children in Commonwealth nations such as India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malta, New Zealand and Australia, and around the world.[126] They have also seen a surge of popularity in China, where they are \"big with every generation\".[75] In March 2004, Chorion and the Chinese publisher Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press negotiated an agreement over the Noddy franchise, which included bringing the character to an animated series on television, with a potential audience of a further 95 million children under the age of five.[127][128] Chorion spent around £10 million digitising Noddy and, as of 2002, had made television agreements with at least 11 countries worldwide.[129]\n\n\nNovelists influenced by Blyton include the crime writer Denise Danks, whose fictional detective Georgina Powers is based on George from the Famous Five. Peter Hunt's *A Step off the Path* (1985) is also influenced by the Famous Five, and the St. Clare's and Malory Towers series provided the inspiration for Jacqueline Wilson's *Double Act* (1996) and Adèle Geras's Egerton Hall trilogy (1990–92) respectively.[130] Blyton was important to Stieg Larsson. \"The series Stieg Larsson most often mentioned were the Famous Five and the Adventure books.\"[131]\n\n\n\n## Critical backlash[edit]\n\n\nA.H. Thompson, who compiled an extensive overview of censorship efforts in the United Kingdom's public libraries, dedicated an entire chapter to \"The Enid Blyton Affair\", and wrote of her in 1975: \n\n\n> \"No single author has caused more controversy among librarians, literary critics, teachers, and other educationalists and parents during the last thirty years, than Enid Blyton. How is it that the books of this tremendously popular writer for children should have given rise to accusations of censorship against librarians in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom?\"[132]\n> \n> \n\n\nBlyton's range of plots and settings has been described as limited, repetitive and continually recycled.[72] Many of her books were critically assessed by teachers and librarians, deemed unfit for children to read, and removed from syllabuses and public libraries.[7] Responding to claims that her moral views were \"dependably predictable\",[133] Blyton commented that \"most of you could write down perfectly correctly all the things that I believe in and stand for – you have found them in my books, and a writer's books are always a faithful reflection of himself\".[134]\n\n\nFrom the 1930s to the 1950s the BBC operated a *de facto* ban on dramatising Blyton's books for radio, considering her to be a \"second-rater\" whose work was without literary merit.[135][136][f] The children's literary critic Margery Fisher likened Blyton's books to \"slow poison\",[7] and Jean E. Sutcliffe of the BBC's schools broadcast department wrote of Blyton's ability to churn out \"mediocre material\", noting that \"her capacity to do so amounts to genius ... anyone else would have died of boredom long ago\".[137] Michael Rosen, Children's Laureate from 2007 until 2009, wrote that \"I find myself flinching at occasional bursts of snobbery and the assumed level of privilege of the children and families in the books.\"[122] The children's author Anne Fine presented an overview of the concerns about Blyton's work and responses to them on BBC Radio 4 in November 2008, in which she noted the \"drip, drip, drip of disapproval\" associated with the books.[138] Blyton's response to her critics was that she was uninterested in the views of anyone over the age of 12, stating that half the attacks on her work were motivated by jealousy and the rest came from \"stupid people who don't know what they're talking about because they've never read any of my books\".[139]\n\n\nDespite criticism by contemporaries that her work's quality began to suffer in the 1950s at the expense of its increasing volume, Blyton nevertheless capitalised on being generally regarded at the time as \"a more 'savoury', English alternative\" to what some considered an \"invasion\" of Britain by American culture, in the form of \"rock music, horror comics, television, teenage culture, delinquency, and Disney\".[15]\n\n\nAccording to British academic Nicholas Tucker, the works of Enid Blyton have been \"banned from more public libraries over the years than is the case with any other adult or children's author\", though such attempts to quell the popularity of her books over the years seem to have been largely unsuccessful, and \"she still remains very widely read\".[140]\n\n\n\n### Simplicity[edit]\n\n\nSome librarians felt that Blyton's restricted use of language, a conscious product of her teaching background, was prejudicial to an appreciation of more literary qualities. In a scathing article published in *Encounter* in 1958, the journalist Colin Welch remarked that it was \"hard to see how a diet of Miss Blyton could help with the 11-plus or even with the Cambridge English Tripos\",[7] but reserved his harshest criticism for Blyton's Noddy, describing him as an \"unnaturally priggish ... sanctimonious ... witless, spiritless, snivelling, sneaking doll.\"[57]\n\n\nThe author and educational psychologist Nicholas Tucker notes that it was common to see Blyton cited as people's favourite or least favourite author according to their age, and argues that her books create an \"encapsulated world for young readers that simply dissolves with age, leaving behind only memories of excitement and strong identification\".[141] Fred Inglis considers Blyton's books to be technically easy to read, but to also be \"emotionally and cognitively easy\". He mentions that the psychologist Michael Woods believed that Blyton was different from many other older authors writing for children in that she seemed untroubled by presenting them with a world that differed from reality. Woods surmised that Blyton \"was a child, she thought as a child, and wrote as a child ... the basic feeling is essentially pre-adolescent ... Enid Blyton has no moral dilemmas ... Inevitably Enid Blyton was labelled by rumour a child-hater. If true, such a fact should come as no surprise to us, for as a child herself all other children can be nothing but rivals for her.\"[142] Inglis argues though that Blyton was clearly devoted to children and put an enormous amount of energy into her work, with a powerful belief in \"representing the crude moral diagrams and garish fantasies of a readership\".[142] Blyton's daughter Imogen has stated that she \"loved a relationship with children through her books\", but real children were an intrusion, and there was no room for intruders in the world that Blyton occupied through her writing.[143]\n\n\n\n### Accusations of racism, xenophobia and sexism[edit]\n\n\nAccusations of racism in Blyton's books were first made by Lena Jeger in a *Guardian* article published in 1966. In the context of discussing possible moves to restrict publications inciting racial hatred, Jeger was critical of Blyton's *The Little Black Doll*, originally published in 1937.[144][145] Sambo, the black doll of the title, is hated by his owner and other toys owing to his \"ugly black face\", and runs away. A shower of \"magic rain\" washes his face clean, after which he is welcomed back home with his now pink face.[146] Jamaica Kincaid also considers the Noddy books to be \"deeply racist\" because of the blonde children and the black golliwogs.[147] In Blyton's 1944 novel *The Island of Adventure*, a black servant named Jo-Jo is very intelligent, but is particularly cruel to the children.[148]\n\n\nAccusations of xenophobia were also made. As George Greenfield observed, \"Enid was very much part of that between the wars middle class which believed that foreigners were untrustworthy or funny or sometimes both\".[149] The publisher Macmillan conducted an internal assessment of Blyton's *The Mystery That Never Was*, submitted to them at the height of her fame in 1960. The review was carried out by the author and books editor Phyllis Hartnoll, in whose view \"There is a faint but unattractive touch of old-fashioned xenophobia in the author's attitude to the thieves; they are 'foreign' ... and this seems to be regarded as sufficient to explain their criminality.\" Macmillan rejected the manuscript,[150] but it was published by William Collins in 1961,[151] and then again in 1965 and 1983.[150]\n\n\nBlyton's depictions of boys and girls are considered by many critics to be sexist.[152][153] In a *Guardian* article published in 2005 Lucy Mangan proposed that *The Famous Five* series depicts a power struggle between Julian, Dick and George (Georgina), in which the female characters either act like boys or are talked down to, as when Dick lectures George: \"it's really time you gave up thinking you're as good as a boy\".[154]\n\n\n\n### Revisions to later editions[edit]\n\n\nTo address criticisms levelled at Blyton's work, some later editions have been altered to reflect more politically progressive attitudes towards issues such as race, gender, violence between young persons, the treatment of children by adults, and legal changes in Britain as to what is allowable for young children to do in the years since the stories were originally written (e.g. purchasing fireworks); modern reprints of the Noddy series substitute teddy bears or goblins for golliwogs, for instance.[155] The golliwogs who steal Noddy's car and dump him naked in the Dark Wood in *Here Comes Noddy Again* are replaced by goblins in the 1986 revision, who strip Noddy only of his shoes and hat and return at the end of the story to apologise.[156]\n\n\n*The Faraway Tree'*s Dame Slap, who made regular use of corporal punishment, was changed to Dame Snap who no longer did so, and the names of Dick and Fanny in the same series were changed to Rick and Frannie.[157] Characters in the Malory Towers and St. Clare's series are no longer spanked or threatened with a spanking, but are instead scolded. References to George's short hair making her look like a boy were removed in revisions to *Five on a Hike Together*, reflecting the idea that girls need not have long hair to be considered feminine or normal.[158] Anne of *The Famous Five* stating that boys cannot wear pretty dresses or like girls' dolls was removed.[159] In *The Adventurous Four*, the names of the young twin girls were changed from Jill and Mary to Pippa and Zoe.[160]\n\n\nIn 2010 Hodder, the publisher of the Famous Five series, announced its intention to update the language used in the books, of which it sold more than half a million copies a year. The changes, which Hodder described as \"subtle\", mainly affect the dialogue rather than the narrative. For instance, \"school tunic\" becomes \"uniform\", \"mother and father\" and \"mother and daddy\" (this latter one used by young female characters and deemed sexist) become \"mum and dad\",[161] \"bathing\" is replaced by \"swimming\", and \"jersey\" by \"jumper\".[157] Some commentators see the changes as necessary to encourage modern readers,[161] whereas others regard them as unnecessary and patronising.[157] In 2016 Hodder's parent company Hachette announced that they would abandon the revisions as, based on feedback, they had not been a success.[162]\n\n\n\n## Stage, film and television adaptations[edit]\n\n\nIn 1954 Blyton adapted Noddy for the stage, producing the *Noddy in Toyland* pantomime in just two or three weeks. The production was staged at the 2660-seat Stoll Theatre in Kingsway, London at Christmas.[163] Its popularity resulted in the show running during the Christmas season for five or six years.[164] Blyton was delighted with its reception by children in the audience, and attended the theatre three or four times a week.[165] TV adaptations of Noddy since 1954 include one in the 1970s narrated by Richard Briers.[166] In 1955 a stage play based on the Famous Five was produced, and in January 1997 the King's Head Theatre embarked on a six-month tour of the UK with *The Famous Five Musical*, to commemorate Blyton's centenary. On 21 November 1998 *The Secret Seven Save the World* was first performed at the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff.[1]\n\n\nThere have also been several film and television adaptations of the Famous Five: by the Children's Film Foundation in 1957 and 1964, Southern Television in 1978–79, and Zenith Productions in 1995–97.[7] The series was also adapted for the German film *Fünf Freunde*, directed by Mike Marzuk and released in 2011.[167]\n\n\nThe Comic Strip, a group of British comedians, produced two extreme parodies of the Famous Five for Channel 4 television: *Five Go Mad in Dorset*, broadcast in 1982,[g] and *Five Go Mad on Mescalin*, broadcast the following year.[1] A third in the series, *Five Go to Rehab*, was broadcast on Sky in 2012.[168]\n\n\nBlyton's *The Faraway Tree* series of books has also been adapted to television and film. On 29 September 1997 the BBC began broadcasting an animated series called *The Enchanted Lands*, based on the series.[169] It was announced in October 2014 that a deal had been signed with publishers Hachette for \"The Faraway Tree\" series to be adapted into a live-action film by director Sam Mendes' production company. Marlene Johnson, head of children's books at Hachette, said: \"Enid Blyton was a passionate advocate of children's storytelling, and The Magic Faraway Tree is a fantastic example of her creative imagination.\"[170]\n\n\nBlyton's *Malory Towers* has been adapted into a musical of the same name by Emma Rice's theatre company. It was scheduled to do a UK spring tour in 2020 which has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nIn 2020, *Malory Towers* was adapted as a 13 part TV series for the BBC. It is made partly in Toronto and partly in the UK in association with Canada's Family Channel. The series went to air in the UK from April 2020 and has been renewed for three more series.[171]\n\n\n\n## Papers[edit]\n\n\nSeven Stories, the National Centre for Children's Books in Newcastle upon Tyne, holds the largest public collection of Blyton's papers and typescripts.[172] The Seven Stories collection contains a significant number of Blyton's typescripts, including the previously unpublished novel, *Mr Tumpy's Caravan*, as well as personal papers and diaries.[173] The purchase of the material in 2010 was made possible by special funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the MLA/V&A Purchase Grant Fund, and two private donations.[174]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Children's literature portal\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n\n\n* Enid Blyton bibliography\n* Enid Blyton Society\n* Enid Blyton's illustrators\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In 1960 alone, eleven Noddy books were published, including the strip books *Noddy and the Runaway Wheel*, *Noddy's Bag of Money*, and *Noddy's Car Gets into Trouble*.[1]\n2. **^** McKellar had written to Blyton in February 1953 asking for the imagery techniques she employed in her writing, for a research project he had undertaken. The results of his investigation were published in *Imagination and Thinking* (1957).[67]\n3. **^** In her leisure time Blyton led the life of a typical suburban housewife, gardening, and playing golf or bridge. She rarely left England, preferring to holiday by the English coast, almost invariably in Dorset,[72] where she and her husband took over the lease of an 18-hole golf course at Studland Bay in 1951.[73]\n4. **^** Despite its name, the society provided accommodation for pre-school infants in need of special care.[87]\n5. **^** The Famous Five Club was run by the publisher of Blyton's Famous Five series.[90]\n6. **^** Blyton submitted her first proposal to the BBC in 1936.[136]\n7. **^** The Comic Strip's *Five Go Mad in Dorset* contains the first occurrence of a phrase wrongly attributed to Blyton, \"lashings of ginger beer\".[130]\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** ***ab*** \n\"Chronology\", Enid Blyton Society, retrieved 23 January 2014\n2. **^** Baverstock (1997), p. 5\n3. **^** Blyton (1952), p. 54\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \nBensoussane, Anita, \"A Biography of Enid Blyton – The Story of Her Life\", Enid Blyton Society, retrieved 25 January 2014\n5. **^** Thompson & Keenan (2006), p. 77\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Druce (1992), p. 9\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** \nRay, Sheila (2004), \"Blyton, Enid Mary (1897–1968)\", *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography* (online ed.), Oxford University Press, doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/31939, retrieved 19 June 2008 (Subscription or UK public library membership required.)\n8. **^** Goldstein, G.

Her books are still enormously popular and have been translated into ninety languages. As of June 2019, Blyton held 4th place for the most translated author. She wrote on a wide range of topics, including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives. She is best remembered today for her *Noddy*, *Famous Five*, *Secret Seven*, the *Five Find-Outers*, and *Malory Towers* books, although she also wrote many others, including the *St. Clare's*, *The Naughtiest Girl*, and *The Faraway Tree* series.\n\n\nHer first book, *Child Whispers*, a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922. Following the commercial success of her early novels, such as *Adventures of the Wishing-Chair* (1937) and *The Enchanted Wood* (1939), Blyton went on to build a literary empire, sometimes producing fifty books a year in addition to her prolific magazine and newspaper contributions. Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind; she typed her stories as events unfolded before her. The sheer volume of her work and the speed with which she produced it led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers, a charge she vigorously denied.\n\n\nBlyton's work became increasingly controversial among literary critics, teachers, and parents beginning in the 1950s due to the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and her themes, particularly in the Noddy series. Some libraries and schools banned her works, and from the 1930s until the 1950s, the BBC refused to broadcast her stories because of their perceived lack of literary merit. Her books have been criticised as elitist, sexist, racist, xenophobic, and at odds with the more progressive environment that was emerging in post-World War II Britain, but they have continued to be bestsellers since her death in 1968.\n\n\nShe felt she had a responsibility to provide her readers with a strong moral framework, so she encouraged them to support worthy causes. In particular, through the clubs she set up or supported, she encouraged and organised them to raise funds for animal and paediatric charities.\n\n\nThe story of Blyton's life was dramatised in *Enid*, a BBC television film featuring Helena Bonham Carter in the title role. It was first broadcast in the UK on BBC Four in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nEnid Blyton was born on 11 August 1897 in East Dulwich, South London, United Kingdom, the eldest of three children, to Thomas Carey Blyton (1870–1920), a cutlery salesman (recorded in the 1911 census with the occupation of \"Mantle Manufacturer dealer [in] women's suits, skirts, etc.\") and his wife Theresa Mary (*née* Harrison; 1874–1950). Enid's younger brothers, Hanly (1899–1983) and Carey (1902–1976), were born after the family had moved to a semi-detached house in Beckenham, then a village in Kent.[1] A few months after her birth, Enid almost died from whooping cough, but was nursed back to health by her father, whom she adored.[2] Thomas Blyton ignited Enid's interest in nature; in her autobiography she wrote that he \"loved flowers and birds and wild animals, and knew more about them than anyone I had ever met\".[3] He also passed on his interest in gardening, art, music, literature, and theatre, and the pair often went on nature walks, much to the disapproval of Enid's mother, who showed little interest in her daughter's pursuits.[4] Enid was devastated when her father left the family shortly after her 13th birthday to live with another woman. Enid and her mother did not have a good relationship, and Enid did not attend either of her parents' funerals.[5]\n\n\nFrom 1907 to 1915, Blyton attended St Christopher's School in Beckenham, where she enjoyed physical activities and became school tennis champion and lacrosse captain.[6] She was not keen on all the academic subjects, but excelled in writing and, in 1911, entered Arthur Mee's children's poetry competition. Mee offered to print her verses, encouraging her to produce more.[1] Blyton's mother considered her efforts at writing to be a \"waste of time and money\", but she was encouraged to persevere by Mabel Attenborough, the aunt of school friend Mary Potter.[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)Seckford Hall in Woodbridge, Suffolk, was an inspiration to Blyton with its haunted room, secret passageway, and sprawling gardens.\nBlyton's father taught her to play the piano, which she mastered well enough for him to believe she might follow in his sister's footsteps and become a professional musician.[6] Blyton considered enrolling at the Guildhall School of Music, but decided she was better suited to becoming a writer.[7] After finishing school, in 1915, as head girl, she moved out of the family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before going to stay with George and Emily Hunt at Seckford Hall, near Woodbridge, in Suffolk. Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway, provided inspiration for her later writing.[1] At Woodbridge Congregational Church, Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at Ipswich High School and suggested she train there as a teacher.[8][9] Blyton was introduced to the children at the nursery school and, recognising her natural affinity with them, enrolled in a National Froebel Union teacher training course at the school in September 1916.[7][10] By this time, she had nearly terminated all contact with her family.[1]\n\n\nBlyton's manuscripts were rejected by publishers on many occasions, which only made her more determined to succeed, saying, \"it is partly the struggle that helps you so much, that gives you determination, character, self-reliance –all things that help in any profession or trade, and most certainly in writing.\" In March 1916, her first poems were published in *Nash's Magazine*.[11] She completed her teacher training course in December 1918 and, the following month, obtained a teaching appointment at Bickley Park School, a small, independent establishment for boys in Bickley, Kent. Two months later, Blyton received a teaching certificate with distinctions in zoology and principles of education; first class in botany, geography, practice and history of education, child hygiene, and classroom teaching; and second class in literature and elementary mathematics.[1] In 1920, she moved to Southernhay, in Hook Road Surbiton, as nursery governess to the four sons of architect Horace Thompson and his wife Gertrude,[7] with whom Blyton spent four happy years. With the shortage of area schools, neighbouring children soon joined her charges, and a small school developed at the house.[12]\n\n\n\n## Early writing career[edit]\n\n\nFurther information on works by Enid Blyton: Enid Blyton bibliography\n\nIn 1920, Blyton moved to Chessington and began writing in her spare time. The following year, she won the *Saturday Westminster Review* writing competition with her essay \"On the Popular Fallacy that to the Pure All Things are Pure\".[13] Publications such as *The Londoner*, *Home Weekly* and *The Bystander* began to show an interest in her short stories and poems.[1]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Child Whispers* (1922)\nBlyton's first book, *Child Whispers*, a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922.[13] Its illustrator, Enid's schoolfriend Phyllis Chase collaborated on several of her early works.[14] Also in that year, Blyton began writing in annuals for Cassell and George Newnes, and her first piece of writing, \"Peronel and his Pot of Glue\", was accepted for publication in *Teachers' World*. Further boosting her success, in 1923, her poems appeared alongside those of Rudyard Kipling, Walter de la Mare, and G. K. Chesterton in a special issue of *Teachers' World.* Blyton's educational texts were influential in the 1920s and 1930s, with her most sizable being the three-volume *The Teacher's Treasury* (1926), the six-volume *Modern Teaching* (1928), the eight-volume *Pictorial Knowledge* (1930), and the four-volume *Modern Teaching in the Infant School* (1932).[15]\n\n\nIn July 1923, Blyton published *Real Fairies*, a collection of thirty-three poems written especially for the book with the exception of \"Pretending\", which had appeared earlier in *Punch* magazine.[16] The following year, she published *The Enid Blyton Book of Fairies*, illustrated by Horace J. Knowles,[17] and in 1926 the *Book of Brownies*.[18] Several books of plays appeared in 1927, including *A Book of Little Plays* and *The Play's the Thing* with the illustrator Alfred Bestall.[19]\n\n\nIn the 1930s, Blyton developed an interest in writing stories related to various myths, including those of ancient Greece and Rome; *The Knights of the Round Table*, *Tales of Ancient Greece* and *Tales of Robin Hood* were published in 1930. In *Tales of Ancient Greece* Blyton retold 16 well-known ancient Greek myths, but used the Latin rather than the Greek names and invented conversations between characters.[20] *The Adventures of Odysseus*, *Tales of the Ancient Greeks and Persians* and *Tales of the Romans* followed in 1934.[21]\n\n\n\n## Commercial success[edit]\n\n\n### New series: 1934–1948[edit]\n\n\nThe first of twenty-eight books in Blyton's Old Thatch series, *The Talking Teapot and Other Tales*, was published in 1934, the same year as *Brer Rabbit Retold*;[22] (note that Brer Rabbit originally featured in Uncle Remus stories by Joel Chandler Harris), her first serial story and first full-length book, *Adventures of the Wishing-Chair*, followed in 1937. *The Enchanted Wood*, the first book in the Faraway Tree series, published in 1939, is about a magic tree inspired by the Norse mythology that had fascinated Blyton as a child.[7] According to Blyton's daughter Gillian the inspiration for the magic tree came from \"thinking up a story one day and suddenly she was walking in the enchanted wood and found the tree. In her imagination she climbed up through the branches and met Moon-Face, Silky, the Saucepan Man and the rest of the characters. She had all she needed.\"[23] As in the Wishing-Chair series, these fantasy books typically involve children being transported into a magical world in which they meet fairies, goblins, elves, pixies and other mythological creatures.\n\n\nBlyton's first full-length adventure novel, *The Secret Island*, was published in 1938, featuring the characters of Jack, Mike, Peggy and Nora.[24] Described by *The Glasgow Herald* as a \"Robinson Crusoe-style adventure on an island in an English lake\", *The Secret Island* was a lifelong favourite of Gillian's and spawned the Secret series.[23] The following year Blyton released her first book in the Circus series[25] and her initial book in the Amelia Jane series, *Naughty Amelia Jane!*[26] According to Gillian the main character was based on a large handmade doll given to her by her mother on her third birthday.[23]\n\n\nDuring the 1940s Blyton became a prolific author, her success enhanced by her \"marketing, publicity and branding that was far ahead of its time\".[27] In 1940 Blyton published two books – *Three Boys and a Circus* and *Children of Kidillin* – under the pseudonym of Mary Pollock (middle name plus first married name),[28] in addition to the eleven published under her own name that year. So popular were Pollock's books that one reviewer was prompted to observe that \"Enid Blyton had better look to her laurels\".[29] But Blyton's readers were not so easily deceived and many complained about the subterfuge to her and her publisher,[29] with the result that all six books published under the name of Mary Pollock – two in 1940 and four in 1943 – were reissued under Blyton's name.[30] Later in 1940 Blyton published the first of her boarding school story books and the first novel in the Naughtiest Girl series, *The Naughtiest Girl in the School*, which followed the exploits of the mischievous schoolgirl Elizabeth Allen at the fictional Whyteleafe School. The first of her six novels in the St. Clare's series, *The Twins at St. Clare's*, appeared the following year, featuring the twin sisters Patricia and Isabel O'Sullivan.[15]\n\n\nIn 1942 Blyton released the first book in the Mary Mouse series, *Mary Mouse and the Dolls' House*, about a mouse exiled from her mousehole who becomes a maid at a dolls' house. Twenty-three books in the series were produced between 1942 and 1964; 10,000 copies were sold in 1942 alone.[31] The same year, Blyton published the first novel in the Famous Five series, *Five on a Treasure Island*, with illustrations by Eileen Soper. Its popularity resulted in twenty-one books between then and 1963, and the characters of Julian, Dick, Anne, George (Georgina) and Timmy the dog became household names in Britain.[32] Matthew Grenby, author of *Children's Literature*, states that the five were involved with \"unmasking hardened villains and solving serious crimes\", although the novels were \"hardly 'hard-boiled' thrillers\".[33] Blyton based the character of Georgina, a tomboy she described as \"short-haired, freckled, sturdy, and snub-nosed\" and \"bold and daring, hot-tempered and loyal\", on herself.[11]\n\n\nBlyton had an interest in biblical narratives, and retold Old and New Testament stories. *The Land of Far-Beyond* (1942) is a Christian parable along the lines of John Bunyan's *The Pilgrim's Progress* (1698), with contemporary children as the main characters.[34] In 1943 she published *The Children's Life of Christ*, a collection of fifty-nine short stories related to the life of Jesus, with her own slant on popular biblical stories, from the Nativity and the Three Wise Men through to the trial, the crucifixion and the resurrection.[35] *Tales from the Bible* was published the following year,[36] followed by *The Boy with the Loaves and Fishes* in 1948.[37]\n\n\nThe first book in Blyton's Five Find-Outers series, *The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage*, was published in 1943, as was the second book in the Faraway series, *The Magic Faraway Tree*, which in 2003 was voted 66th in the BBC's Big Read poll to find the UK's favourite book.[38] Several of Blyton's works during this period have seaside themes; *John Jolly by the Sea* (1943), a picture book intended for younger readers, was published in a booklet format by Evans Brothers.[39] Other books with a maritime theme include *The Secret of Cliff Castle* and *Smuggler Ben*, both attributed to Mary Pollock in 1943;[40] *The Island of Adventure*, the first in the Adventure series of eight novels from 1944 onwards;[41] and various novels of the Famous Five series such as *Five on a Treasure Island* (1942),[42] *Five on Kirrin Island Again* (1947)[43] and *Five Go Down to the Sea* (1953).[44]\n\n\nCapitalising on her success, with a loyal and ever-growing readership,[15] Blyton produced a new edition of many of her series such as the Famous Five, the Five Find-Outers and St. Clare's every year in addition to many other novels, short stories and books. In 1946 Blyton launched the first in the Malory Towers series of six books based around the schoolgirl Darrell Rivers, *First Term at Malory Towers*, which became extremely popular, particularly with girls.[45]\n\n\n\n### Peak output: 1949–1959[edit]\n\n\nThe first book in Blyton's Barney Mysteries series, *The Rockingdown Mystery*, was published in 1949,[46] as was the first of her fifteen Secret Seven novels.[47] The Secret Seven Society consists of Peter, his sister Janet, and their friends Colin, George, Jack, Pam and Barbara, who meet regularly in a shed in the garden to discuss peculiar events in their local community. Blyton rewrote the stories so they could be adapted into cartoons, which appeared in *Mickey Mouse Weekly* in 1951 with illustrations by George Brook. The French author Evelyne Lallemand continued the series in the 1970s, producing an additional twelve books, nine of which were translated into English by Anthea Bell between 1983 and 1987.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blyton's characters Noddy and Big Ears\nBlyton's Noddy, about a little wooden boy from Toyland, first appeared in the *Sunday Graphic* on 5 June 1949, and in November that year *Noddy Goes to Toyland*, the first of at least two dozen books in the series, was published. The idea was conceived by one of Blyton's publishers, Sampson, Low, Marston and Company, who in 1949 arranged a meeting between Blyton and the Dutch illustrator Harmsen van der Beek. Despite having to communicate via an interpreter, he provided some initial sketches of how Toyland and its characters would be represented. Four days after the meeting Blyton sent the text of the first two Noddy books to her publisher, to be forwarded to van der Beek.[49] The Noddy books became one of her most successful and best-known series, and were hugely popular in the 1950s.[50] An extensive range of sub-series, spin-offs and strip books were produced throughout the decade, including *Noddy's Library*, *Noddy's Garage of Books*, *Noddy's Castle of Books*, *Noddy's Toy Station of Books* and *Noddy's Shop of Books*.[51]\n\n\nIn 1950 Blyton established the company Darrell Waters Ltd to manage her affairs. By the early 1950s she had reached the peak of her output, often publishing more than fifty books a year, and she remained extremely prolific throughout much of the decade.[52] By 1955 Blyton had written her fourteenth Famous Five novel, *Five Have Plenty of Fun*, her fifteenth Mary Mouse book, *Mary Mouse in Nursery Rhyme Land*, her eighth book in the Adventure series, *The River of Adventure*, and her seventh Secret Seven novel, *Secret Seven Win Through*. She completed the sixth and final book of the Malory Towers series, *Last Term at Malory Towers*, in 1951.[45]\n\n\nBlyton published several further books featuring the character of Scamp the terrier, following on from *The Adventures of Scamp*, a novel she had released in 1943 under the pseudonym of Mary Pollock.[53] *Scamp Goes on Holiday* (1952) and *Scamp and Bimbo*, *Scamp at School*, *Scamp and Caroline* and *Scamp Goes to the Zoo* (1954) were illustrated by Pierre Probst. She introduced the character of Bom, a stylish toy drummer dressed in a bright red coat and helmet, alongside Noddy in *TV Comic* in July 1956.[54] A book series began the same year with *Bom the Little Toy Drummer*, featuring illustrations by R. Paul-Hoye,[55] and followed with *Bom and His Magic Drumstick* (1957), *Bom Goes Adventuring* and *Bom Goes to Ho Ho Village* (1958), *Bom and the Clown* and *Bom and the Rainbow* (1959) and *Bom Goes to Magic Town* (1960). In 1958 she produced two annuals featuring the character, the first of which included twenty short stories, poems and picture strips.[56]\n\n\n\n### Final works[edit]\n\n\nMany of Blyton's series, including Noddy and The Famous Five, continued to be successful in the 1960s; by 1962, 26 million copies of Noddy had been sold.[1][a] Blyton concluded several of her long-running series in 1963, publishing the last books of The Famous Five (*Five Are Together Again*) and The Secret Seven (*Fun for the Secret Seven*); she also produced three more Brer Rabbit books with the illustrator Grace Lodge: *Brer Rabbit Again*, *Brer Rabbit Book*, and *Brer Rabbit's a Rascal*. In 1962 many of her books were among the first to be published by Armada Books in paperback, making them more affordable to children.[1]\n\n\nAfter 1963 Blyton's output was generally confined to short stories and books intended for very young readers, such as *Learn to Count with Noddy* and *Learn to Tell Time with Noddy* in 1965, and *Stories for Bedtime* and the Sunshine Picture Story Book collection in 1966. Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend.[57] Blyton published her last book in the Noddy series, *Noddy and the Aeroplane*, in February 1964. In May the following year she published *Mixed Bag*, a song book with music written by her nephew Carey, and in August she released her last full-length books, *The Man Who Stopped to Help* and *The Boy Who Came Back*.[1]\n\n\n\n## Magazine and newspaper contributions[edit]\n\n\nBlyton cemented her reputation as a children's writer when in 1926 she took over the editing of *Sunny Stories*, a magazine that typically included the re-telling of legends, myths, stories and other articles for children.[7] That same year she was given her own column in *Teachers' World*, entitled \"From my Window\". Three years later she began contributing a weekly page in the magazine, in which she published letters from her fox terrier dog Bobs.[1] They proved to be so popular that in 1933 they were published in book form as *Letters from Bobs*,[58] and sold ten thousand copies in the first week.[1] Her most popular feature was \"Round the Year with Enid Blyton\", which consisted of forty-eight articles covering aspects of natural history such as weather, pond life, how to plant a school garden and how to make a bird table.[59] Among Blyton's other nature projects was her monthly \"Country Letter\" feature that appeared in *The Nature Lover* magazine in 1935.[60]\n\n\n*Sunny Stories* was renamed *Enid Blyton's Sunny Stories* in January 1937, and served as a vehicle for the serialisation of Blyton's books. Her first Naughty Amelia Jane story, about an anti-heroine based on a doll owned by her daughter Gillian,[61] was published in the magazine.[1] Blyton stopped contributing in 1952, and it closed down the following year, shortly before the appearance of the new fortnightly *Enid Blyton Magazine* written entirely by Blyton.[62] The first edition appeared on 18 March 1953,[63] and the magazine ran until September 1959.[7]\n\n\nNoddy made his first appearance in the *Sunday Graphic* in 1949, the same year as Blyton's first daily Noddy strip for the London *Evening Standard*.[1] It was illustrated by van der Beek until his death in 1953.[1][64]\n\n\n\n## Writing style and technique[edit]\n\n\nBlyton worked in a wide range of fictional genres, from fairy tales to animal, nature, detective, mystery, and circus stories, but she often \"blurred the boundaries\" in her books, and encompassed a range of genres even in her short stories.[65] In a 1958 article published in *The Author*, she wrote that there were a \"dozen or more different types of stories for children\", and she had tried them all, but her favourites were those with a family at their centre.[66]\n\n\nIn a letter to the psychologist Peter McKellar,[b] Blyton describes her writing technique:\n\n\n\n\n> I shut my eyes for a few minutes, with my portable typewriter on my knee – I make my mind a blank and wait – and then, as clearly as I would see real children, my characters stand before me in my mind's eye ... The first sentence comes straight into my mind, I don't have to think of it – I don't have to think of anything.[68]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn another letter to McKellar she describes how in just five days she wrote the 60,000-word book *The River of Adventure*, the eighth in her Adventure Series,[69] by listening to what she referred to as her \"under-mind\",[70] which she contrasted with her \"upper conscious mind\".[71] Blyton was unwilling to conduct any research or planning before beginning work on a new book, which coupled with the lack of variety in her life[c] according to Druce almost inevitably presented the danger that she might unconsciously, and clearly did, plagiarise the books she had read, including her own.[72] Gillian has recalled that her mother \"never knew where her stories came from\", but that she used to talk about them \"coming from her 'mind's eye'\", as did William Wordsworth and Charles Dickens. Blyton had \"thought it was made up of every experience she'd ever had, everything she's seen or heard or read, much of which had long disappeared from her conscious memory\" but never knew the direction her stories would take. Blyton further explained in her biography that \"If I tried to think out or invent the whole book, I could not do it. For one thing, it would bore me and for another, it would lack the 'verve' and the extraordinary touches and surprising ideas that flood out from my imagination.\"[23]\n\n\nBlyton's daily routine varied little over the years. She usually began writing soon after breakfast, with her portable typewriter on her knee and her favourite red Moroccan shawl nearby; she believed that the colour red acted as a \"mental stimulus\" for her. Stopping only for a short lunch break she continued writing until five o'clock, by which time she would usually have produced 6,000–10,000 words.[74]\n\n\nA 2000 article in *The Malay Mail* considers Blyton's children to have \"lived in a world shaped by the realities of post-war austerity\", enjoying freedom without the political correctness of today, which serves modern readers of Blyton's novels with a form of escapism.[75] Brandon Robshaw of *The Independent* refers to the Blyton universe as \"crammed with colour and character\", \"self-contained and internally consistent\", noting that Blyton exemplifies a strong mistrust of adults and figures of authority in her works, creating a world in which children govern.[76] Gillian noted that in her mother's adventure, detective and school stories for older children, \"the hook is the strong storyline with plenty of cliffhangers, a trick she acquired from her years of writing serialised stories for children's magazines. There is always a strong moral framework in which bravery and loyalty are (eventually) rewarded\".[23] Blyton herself wrote that \"my love of children is the whole foundation of all my work\".[77]\n\n\nVictor Watson, Assistant Director of Research at Homerton College, Cambridge, believes that Blyton's works reveal an \"essential longing and potential associated with childhood\", and notes how the opening pages of *The Mountain of Adventure* present a \"deeply appealing ideal of childhood\".[78] He argues that Blyton's work differs from that of many other authors in its approach, describing the narrative of The Famous Five series for instance as \"like a powerful spotlight, it seeks to illuminate, to explain, to demystify. It takes its readers on a roller-coaster story in which the darkness is always banished; everything puzzling, arbitrary, evocative is either dismissed or explained\". Watson further notes how Blyton often used minimalist visual descriptions and introduced a few careless phrases such as \"gleamed enchantingly\" to appeal to her young readers.[79]\n\n\nFrom the mid-1950s rumours began to circulate that Blyton had not written all the books attributed to her, a charge she found particularly distressing. She published an appeal in her magazine asking children to let her know if they heard such stories and, after one mother informed her that she had attended a parents' meeting at her daughter's school during which a young librarian had repeated the allegation,[80] Blyton decided in 1955 to begin legal proceedings.[1] The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year, but the rumours that Blyton operated \"a 'company' of ghost writers\" persisted, as some found it difficult to believe that one woman working alone could produce such a volume of work.[81]\n\n\n\n## Charitable work[edit]\n\n\nBlyton felt a responsibility to provide her readers with a positive moral framework, and she encouraged them to support worthy causes.[82] Her view, expressed in a 1957 article, was that children should help animals and other children rather than adults:\n\n\n\n\n> [children] are not interested in helping adults; indeed, they think that adults themselves should tackle adult needs. But they are intensely interested in animals and other children and feel compassion for the blind boys and girls, and for the spastics who are unable to walk or talk.[83]\n> \n> \n\n\nBlyton and the members of the children's clubs she promoted via her magazines raised a great deal of money for various charities; according to Blyton, membership of her clubs meant \"working for others, for no reward\". The largest of the clubs she was involved with was the Busy Bees, the junior section of the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals, which Blyton had actively supported since 1933. The club had been set up by Maria Dickin in 1934,[84] and after Blyton publicised its existence in the *Enid Blyton Magazine* it attracted 100,000 members in three years.[85] Such was Blyton's popularity among children that after she became Queen Bee in 1952 more than 20,000 additional members were recruited in her first year in office.[84] The Enid Blyton Magazine Club was formed in 1953.[1] Its primary objective was to raise funds to help those children with cerebral palsy who attended a centre in Cheyne Walk, in Chelsea, London, by furnishing an on-site hostel among other things.[86]\n\n\nThe Famous Five series gathered such a following that readers asked Blyton if they might form a fan club. She agreed, on condition that it serve a useful purpose, and suggested that it could raise funds for the Shaftesbury Society Babies' Home[d] in Beaconsfield, on whose committee she had served since 1948.[88] The club was established in 1952, and provided funds for equipping a Famous Five Ward at the home, a paddling pool, sun room, summer house, playground, birthday and Christmas celebrations, and visits to the pantomime.[87] By the late 1950s Blyton's clubs had a membership of 500,000, and raised £35,000 in the six years of the *Enid Blyton Magazine'*s run.[4]\n\n\nBy 1974 the Famous Five Club had a membership of 220,000, and was growing at the rate of 6,000 new members a year.[89][e] The Beaconsfield home it was set up to support closed in 1967, but the club continued to raise funds for other paediatric charities, including an Enid Blyton bed at Great Ormond Street Hospital and a mini-bus for disabled children at Stoke Mandeville Hospital.[91]\n\n\n\n## Jigsaw puzzle and games[edit]\n\n\nBlyton capitalised upon her commercial success as an author by negotiating agreements with jigsaw puzzle and games manufacturers from the late 1940s onwards; by the early 1960s some 146 different companies were involved in merchandising Noddy alone.[92] In 1948 Bestime released four jigsaw puzzles featuring her characters, and the first Enid Blyton board game appeared, *Journey Through Fairyland*, created by BGL. The first card game, Faraway Tree, appeared from Pepys in 1950. In 1954 Bestime released the first four jigsaw puzzles of the Secret Seven, and the following year a Secret Seven card game appeared.[48]\n\n\nBestime released the Little Noddy Car Game in 1953 and the Little Noddy Leap Frog Game in 1955, and in 1956 American manufacturer Parker Brothers released Little Noddy's Taxi Game, a board game which features Noddy driving about town, picking up various characters.[93] Bestime released its Plywood Noddy Jigsaws series in 1957 and a Noddy jigsaw series featuring cards appeared from 1963, with illustrations by Robert Lee. Arrow Games became the chief producer of Noddy jigsaws in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[92] Whitman manufactured four new Secret Seven jigsaw puzzles in 1975, and produced four new Malory Towers ones two years later.[48] In 1979 the company released a Famous Five adventure board game, Famous Five Kirrin Island Treasure.[94] Stephen Thraves wrote eight Famous Five adventure game books, published by Hodder & Stoughton in the 1980s. The first adventure game book of the series, *The Wreckers' Tower Game*, was published in October 1984.[95]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blyton's home \"Old Thatch\" near Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, where she lived from 1929 to 1938\nOn 28 August 1924, Blyton married Major Hugh Alexander Pollock, DSO (1888–1971) at Bromley Register Office, without inviting her family.[1] They married shortly after his divorce from his first wife, with whom he had two sons, one of them already deceased. Pollock was editor of the book department in the publishing firm George Newnes, which became Blyton's regular publisher. It was he who requested her to write a book about animals, resulting in *The Zoo Book*, completed in the month before their marriage.[1] They initially lived in a flat in Chelsea before moving to Elfin Cottage in Beckenham in 1926 and then to Old Thatch in Bourne End (called Peterswood in her books) in 1929.[7][96] Blyton's first daughter, Gillian, was born on 15 July 1931, and, after a miscarriage in 1934,[4] she gave birth to a second daughter, Imogen, on 27 October 1935.[1]\n\n\nIn 1938, she and her family moved to a house in Beaconsfield, named Green Hedges by Blyton's readers, following a competition in her magazine. By the mid-1930s, Pollock had become a secret alcoholic, withdrawing increasingly from public life[97]—possibly triggered through his meetings, as a publisher, with Winston Churchill, which may have reawakened the trauma Pollock suffered during World War I. With the outbreak of World War II, he became involved in the Home Guard[97] and also re-encountered Ida Crowe, an aspiring writer 19 years his junior, whom he had first met years earlier. He made her an offer to join him as secretary in his posting to a Home Guard training center at Denbies, a Gothic mansion in Surrey belonging to Lord Ashcombe, and they began a romantic relationship.[98]\n\n\nBlyton's marriage to Pollock was troubled for years, and according to Crowe's memoir, she had a series of affairs,[98] including a lesbian relationship with one of the children's nannies.[98][99] In 1941, Blyton met Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters, a London surgeon with whom she began a serious affair.[100] Pollock discovered the liaison, and threatened to initiate divorce proceedings.[101] Due to fears that exposure of her adultery would ruin her public image,[98] it was ultimately agreed that Blyton would instead file for divorce against Pollock.[101] According to Crowe's memoir, Blyton promised that if he admitted to infidelity, she would allow him parental access to their daughters; but after the divorce, he was denied contact with them, and Blyton made sure he was subsequently unable to find work in publishing. Pollock, having married Crowe on 26 October 1943, eventually resumed his heavy drinking and was forced to petition for bankruptcy in 1950.[98]\n\n\nBlyton and Darrell Waters married at the City of Westminster Register Office on 20 October 1943. She changed the surname of her daughters to Darrell Waters[102] and publicly embraced her new role as a happily married and devoted doctor's wife.[7] After discovering she was pregnant in the spring of 1945, Blyton miscarried five months later, following a fall from a ladder. The baby would have been Darrell Waters's first child and the son for which they both longed.[4]\n\n\nHer love of tennis included playing naked, with nude tennis \"a common practice in those days among the more louche members of the middle classes\".[103][104]\n\n\nBlyton's health began to deteriorate in 1957, when, during a round of golf, she started to feel faint and breathless,[105] and, by 1960, she was displaying signs of dementia.[106] Her agent, George Greenfield, recalled that it was \"unthinkable\" for the \"most famous and successful of children's authors with her enormous energy and computerlike memory\" to be losing her mind and suffering from what is now known as Alzheimer's disease in her mid-60s.[106] Worsening Blyton's situation was her husband's declining health throughout the 1960s; he suffered from severe arthritis in his neck and hips, deafness, and became increasingly ill-tempered and erratic until his death on 15 September 1967.[100][107]\n\n\nThe story of Blyton's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled *Enid*, which aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Four on 16 November 2009.[108] Helena Bonham Carter, who played the title role, described Blyton as \"a complete workaholic, an achievement junkie and an extremely canny businesswoman\" who \"knew how to brand herself, right down to the famous signature\".[27]\n\n\n\n## Death and legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blue plaque on Blyton's childhood home in Ondine Road, East Dulwich, South London\nDuring the months following her husband's death, Blyton became increasingly ill and moved into a nursing home three months before her death. She died in her sleep of Alzheimer's disease at the Greenways Nursing Home, Hampstead, North London, on 28 November 1968, aged 71. A memorial service was held at St James's Church, Piccadilly[1] and she was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, where her ashes remain. Blyton's home, Green Hedges, was auctioned on 26 May 1971 and demolished in 1973;[109] the site is now occupied by houses and a street named Blyton Close. An English Heritage blue plaque commemorates Blyton at Hook Road in Chessington, where she lived from 1920 to 1924.[110] In 2014, a plaque recording her time as a Beaconsfield resident from 1938 until her death in 1968 was unveiled in the town hall gardens, next to small iron figures of Noddy and Big Ears.[111]\n\n\nSince her death and the publication of her daughter Imogen's 1989 autobiography, *A Childhood at Green Hedges*, Blyton has emerged as an emotionally immature, unstable and often malicious figure.[27] Imogen considered her mother to be \"arrogant, insecure, pretentious, very skilled at putting difficult or unpleasant things out of her mind, and without a trace of maternal instinct. As a child, I viewed her as a rather strict authority. As an adult I pitied her.\"[112] Blyton's eldest daughter Gillian remembered her rather differently however, as \"a fair and loving mother, and a fascinating companion\".[112]\n\n\nThe Enid Blyton Trust for Children was established in 1982, with Imogen as its first chairman,[113] and in 1985 it established the National Library for the Handicapped Child.[7] *Enid Blyton's Adventure Magazine* began publication in September 1985 and, on 14 October 1992, the BBC began publishing *Noddy Magazine* and released the Noddy CD-Rom in October 1996.[1]\n\n\nThe first Enid Blyton Day was held at Rickmansworth on 6 March 1993 and, in October 1996, the Enid Blyton award, The Enid, was given to those who have made outstanding contributions towards children.[1] The Enid Blyton Society was formed in early 1995, to provide \"a focal point for collectors and enthusiasts of Enid Blyton\" through its thrice-annual *Enid Blyton Society Journal*, its annual Enid Blyton Day and its website.[114] On 16 December 1996, Channel 4 broadcast a documentary about Blyton, *Secret Lives*. To celebrate her centenary in 1997, exhibitions were put on at the London Toy & Model Museum (now closed), Hereford and Worcester County Museum and Bromley Library and, on 9 September, the Royal Mail issued centenary stamps.[1]\n\n\nThe London-based entertainment and retail company Trocadero plc purchased Blyton's Darrell Waters Ltd in 1995 for £14.6 million and established a subsidiary, Enid Blyton Ltd, to handle all intellectual properties, character brands and media in Blyton's works.[1][7] The group changed its name to Chorion in 1998 but, after financial difficulties in 2012, sold its assets. Hachette UK acquired from Chorion world rights in the Blyton estate in March 2013, including The Famous Five series[115] but excluding the rights to Noddy, which had been sold to DreamWorks Classics (formerly Classic Media, now a subsidiary of DreamWorks Animation)[116] in 2012.\n\n\nBlyton's granddaughter, Sophie Smallwood, wrote a new Noddy book to celebrate the character's 60th birthday, 46 years after the last book was published; *Noddy and the Farmyard Muddle* (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall.[117] In February 2011, the manuscript of a previously unknown Blyton novel, *Mr Tumpy's Caravan*, was discovered by the archivist at Seven Stories, National Centre for Children's Books in a collection of papers belonging to Blyton's daughter Gillian, purchased by Seven Stories in 2010 following her death.[118][119] It was initially thought to belong to a comic strip collection of the same name published in 1949, but it appears to be unrelated and is believed to be something written in the 1930s, which had been rejected by a publisher.[119][120]\n\n\nIn a 1982 survey of 10,000 eleven-year-old children, Blyton was voted their most popular writer.[1] She is the world's fourth most-translated author, behind Agatha Christie, Jules Verne and William Shakespeare[121] with her books being translated into 90 languages.[122] From 2000 to 2010, Blyton was listed as a Top Ten author, selling almost 8 million copies (worth £31.2 million) in the UK alone.[123] In 2003, *The Magic Faraway Tree* was voted 66th in the BBC's Big Read, a year-long survey of the UK's best-loved novels.[38] In a 2008 poll conducted by the Costa Book Awards, Blyton was voted the UK's best-loved author ahead of Roald Dahl, J. K. Rowling, Jane Austen and Shakespeare.[124][125] Her books continue to be very popular among children in Commonwealth nations such as India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malta, New Zealand and Australia, and around the world.[126] They have also seen a surge of popularity in China, where they are \"big with every generation\".[75] In March 2004, Chorion and the Chinese publisher Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press negotiated an agreement over the Noddy franchise, which included bringing the character to an animated series on television, with a potential audience of a further 95 million children under the age of five.[127][128] Chorion spent around £10 million digitising Noddy and, as of 2002, had made television agreements with at least 11 countries worldwide.[129]\n\n\nNovelists influenced by Blyton include the crime writer Denise Danks, whose fictional detective Georgina Powers is based on George from the Famous Five. Peter Hunt's *A Step off the Path* (1985) is also influenced by the Famous Five, and the St. Clare's and Malory Towers series provided the inspiration for Jacqueline Wilson's *Double Act* (1996) and Adèle Geras's Egerton Hall trilogy (1990–92) respectively.[130] Blyton was important to Stieg Larsson. \"The series Stieg Larsson most often mentioned were the Famous Five and the Adventure books.\"[131]\n\n\n\n## Critical backlash[edit]\n\n\nA.H. Thompson, who compiled an extensive overview of censorship efforts in the United Kingdom's public libraries, dedicated an entire chapter to \"The Enid Blyton Affair\", and wrote of her in 1975: \n\n\n> \"No single author has caused more controversy among librarians, literary critics, teachers, and other educationalists and parents during the last thirty years, than Enid Blyton. How is it that the books of this tremendously popular writer for children should have given rise to accusations of censorship against librarians in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom?\"[132]\n> \n> \n\n\nBlyton's range of plots and settings has been described as limited, repetitive and continually recycled.[72] Many of her books were critically assessed by teachers and librarians, deemed unfit for children to read, and removed from syllabuses and public libraries.[7] Responding to claims that her moral views were \"dependably predictable\",[133] Blyton commented that \"most of you could write down perfectly correctly all the things that I believe in and stand for – you have found them in my books, and a writer's books are always a faithful reflection of himself\".[134]\n\n\nFrom the 1930s to the 1950s the BBC operated a *de facto* ban on dramatising Blyton's books for radio, considering her to be a \"second-rater\" whose work was without literary merit.[135][136][f] The children's literary critic Margery Fisher likened Blyton's books to \"slow poison\",[7] and Jean E. Sutcliffe of the BBC's schools broadcast department wrote of Blyton's ability to churn out \"mediocre material\", noting that \"her capacity to do so amounts to genius ... anyone else would have died of boredom long ago\".[137] Michael Rosen, Children's Laureate from 2007 until 2009, wrote that \"I find myself flinching at occasional bursts of snobbery and the assumed level of privilege of the children and families in the books.\"[122] The children's author Anne Fine presented an overview of the concerns about Blyton's work and responses to them on BBC Radio 4 in November 2008, in which she noted the \"drip, drip, drip of disapproval\" associated with the books.[138] Blyton's response to her critics was that she was uninterested in the views of anyone over the age of 12, stating that half the attacks on her work were motivated by jealousy and the rest came from \"stupid people who don't know what they're talking about because they've never read any of my books\".[139]\n\n\nDespite criticism by contemporaries that her work's quality began to suffer in the 1950s at the expense of its increasing volume, Blyton nevertheless capitalised on being generally regarded at the time as \"a more 'savoury', English alternative\" to what some considered an \"invasion\" of Britain by American culture, in the form of \"rock music, horror comics, television, teenage culture, delinquency, and Disney\".[15]\n\n\nAccording to British academic Nicholas Tucker, the works of Enid Blyton have been \"banned from more public libraries over the years than is the case with any other adult or children's author\", though such attempts to quell the popularity of her books over the years seem to have been largely unsuccessful, and \"she still remains very widely read\".[140]\n\n\n\n### Simplicity[edit]\n\n\nSome librarians felt that Blyton's restricted use of language, a conscious product of her teaching background, was prejudicial to an appreciation of more literary qualities. In a scathing article published in *Encounter* in 1958, the journalist Colin Welch remarked that it was \"hard to see how a diet of Miss Blyton could help with the 11-plus or even with the Cambridge English Tripos\",[7] but reserved his harshest criticism for Blyton's Noddy, describing him as an \"unnaturally priggish ... sanctimonious ... witless, spiritless, snivelling, sneaking doll.\"[57]\n\n\nThe author and educational psychologist Nicholas Tucker notes that it was common to see Blyton cited as people's favourite or least favourite author according to their age, and argues that her books create an \"encapsulated world for young readers that simply dissolves with age, leaving behind only memories of excitement and strong identification\".[141] Fred Inglis considers Blyton's books to be technically easy to read, but to also be \"emotionally and cognitively easy\". He mentions that the psychologist Michael Woods believed that Blyton was different from many other older authors writing for children in that she seemed untroubled by presenting them with a world that differed from reality. Woods surmised that Blyton \"was a child, she thought as a child, and wrote as a child ... the basic feeling is essentially pre-adolescent ... Enid Blyton has no moral dilemmas ... Inevitably Enid Blyton was labelled by rumour a child-hater. If true, such a fact should come as no surprise to us, for as a child herself all other children can be nothing but rivals for her.\"[142] Inglis argues though that Blyton was clearly devoted to children and put an enormous amount of energy into her work, with a powerful belief in \"representing the crude moral diagrams and garish fantasies of a readership\".[142] Blyton's daughter Imogen has stated that she \"loved a relationship with children through her books\", but real children were an intrusion, and there was no room for intruders in the world that Blyton occupied through her writing.[143]\n\n\n\n### Accusations of racism, xenophobia and sexism[edit]\n\n\nAccusations of racism in Blyton's books were first made by Lena Jeger in a *Guardian* article published in 1966. In the context of discussing possible moves to restrict publications inciting racial hatred, Jeger was critical of Blyton's *The Little Black Doll*, originally published in 1937.[144][145] Sambo, the black doll of the title, is hated by his owner and other toys owing to his \"ugly black face\", and runs away. A shower of \"magic rain\" washes his face clean, after which he is welcomed back home with his now pink face.[146] Jamaica Kincaid also considers the Noddy books to be \"deeply racist\" because of the blonde children and the black golliwogs.[147] In Blyton's 1944 novel *The Island of Adventure*, a black servant named Jo-Jo is very intelligent, but is particularly cruel to the children.[148]\n\n\nAccusations of xenophobia were also made. As George Greenfield observed, \"Enid was very much part of that between the wars middle class which believed that foreigners were untrustworthy or funny or sometimes both\".[149] The publisher Macmillan conducted an internal assessment of Blyton's *The Mystery That Never Was*, submitted to them at the height of her fame in 1960. The review was carried out by the author and books editor Phyllis Hartnoll, in whose view \"There is a faint but unattractive touch of old-fashioned xenophobia in the author's attitude to the thieves; they are 'foreign' ... and this seems to be regarded as sufficient to explain their criminality.\" Macmillan rejected the manuscript,[150] but it was published by William Collins in 1961,[151] and then again in 1965 and 1983.[150]\n\n\nBlyton's depictions of boys and girls are considered by many critics to be sexist.[152][153] In a *Guardian* article published in 2005 Lucy Mangan proposed that *The Famous Five* series depicts a power struggle between Julian, Dick and George (Georgina), in which the female characters either act like boys or are talked down to, as when Dick lectures George: \"it's really time you gave up thinking you're as good as a boy\".[154]\n\n\n\n### Revisions to later editions[edit]\n\n\nTo address criticisms levelled at Blyton's work, some later editions have been altered to reflect more politically progressive attitudes towards issues such as race, gender, violence between young persons, the treatment of children by adults, and legal changes in Britain as to what is allowable for young children to do in the years since the stories were originally written (e.g. purchasing fireworks); modern reprints of the Noddy series substitute teddy bears or goblins for golliwogs, for instance.[155] The golliwogs who steal Noddy's car and dump him naked in the Dark Wood in *Here Comes Noddy Again* are replaced by goblins in the 1986 revision, who strip Noddy only of his shoes and hat and return at the end of the story to apologise.[156]\n\n\n*The Faraway Tree'*s Dame Slap, who made regular use of corporal punishment, was changed to Dame Snap who no longer did so, and the names of Dick and Fanny in the same series were changed to Rick and Frannie.[157] Characters in the Malory Towers and St. Clare's series are no longer spanked or threatened with a spanking, but are instead scolded. References to George's short hair making her look like a boy were removed in revisions to *Five on a Hike Together*, reflecting the idea that girls need not have long hair to be considered feminine or normal.[158] Anne of *The Famous Five* stating that boys cannot wear pretty dresses or like girls' dolls was removed.[159] In *The Adventurous Four*, the names of the young twin girls were changed from Jill and Mary to Pippa and Zoe.[160]\n\n\nIn 2010 Hodder, the publisher of the Famous Five series, announced its intention to update the language used in the books, of which it sold more than half a million copies a year. The changes, which Hodder described as \"subtle\", mainly affect the dialogue rather than the narrative. For instance, \"school tunic\" becomes \"uniform\", \"mother and father\" and \"mother and daddy\" (this latter one used by young female characters and deemed sexist) become \"mum and dad\",[161] \"bathing\" is replaced by \"swimming\", and \"jersey\" by \"jumper\".[157] Some commentators see the changes as necessary to encourage modern readers,[161] whereas others regard them as unnecessary and patronising.[157] In 2016 Hodder's parent company Hachette announced that they would abandon the revisions as, based on feedback, they had not been a success.[162]\n\n\n\n## Stage, film and television adaptations[edit]\n\n\nIn 1954 Blyton adapted Noddy for the stage, producing the *Noddy in Toyland* pantomime in just two or three weeks. The production was staged at the 2660-seat Stoll Theatre in Kingsway, London at Christmas.[163] Its popularity resulted in the show running during the Christmas season for five or six years.[164] Blyton was delighted with its reception by children in the audience, and attended the theatre three or four times a week.[165] TV adaptations of Noddy since 1954 include one in the 1970s narrated by Richard Briers.[166] In 1955 a stage play based on the Famous Five was produced, and in January 1997 the King's Head Theatre embarked on a six-month tour of the UK with *The Famous Five Musical*, to commemorate Blyton's centenary. On 21 November 1998 *The Secret Seven Save the World* was first performed at the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff.[1]\n\n\nThere have also been several film and television adaptations of the Famous Five: by the Children's Film Foundation in 1957 and 1964, Southern Television in 1978–79, and Zenith Productions in 1995–97.[7] The series was also adapted for the German film *Fünf Freunde*, directed by Mike Marzuk and released in 2011.[167]\n\n\nThe Comic Strip, a group of British comedians, produced two extreme parodies of the Famous Five for Channel 4 television: *Five Go Mad in Dorset*, broadcast in 1982,[g] and *Five Go Mad on Mescalin*, broadcast the following year.[1] A third in the series, *Five Go to Rehab*, was broadcast on Sky in 2012.[168]\n\n\nBlyton's *The Faraway Tree* series of books has also been adapted to television and film. On 29 September 1997 the BBC began broadcasting an animated series called *The Enchanted Lands*, based on the series.[169] It was announced in October 2014 that a deal had been signed with publishers Hachette for \"The Faraway Tree\" series to be adapted into a live-action film by director Sam Mendes' production company. Marlene Johnson, head of children's books at Hachette, said: \"Enid Blyton was a passionate advocate of children's storytelling, and The Magic Faraway Tree is a fantastic example of her creative imagination.\"[170]\n\n\nBlyton's *Malory Towers* has been adapted into a musical of the same name by Emma Rice's theatre company. It was scheduled to do a UK spring tour in 2020 which has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nIn 2020, *Malory Towers* was adapted as a 13 part TV series for the BBC. It is made partly in Toronto and partly in the UK in association with Canada's Family Channel. The series went to air in the UK from April 2020 and has been renewed for three more series.[171]\n\n\n\n## Papers[edit]\n\n\nSeven Stories, the National Centre for Children's Books in Newcastle upon Tyne, holds the largest public collection of Blyton's papers and typescripts.[172] The Seven Stories collection contains a significant number of Blyton's typescripts, including the previously unpublished novel, *Mr Tumpy's Caravan*, as well as personal papers and diaries.[173] The purchase of the material in 2010 was made possible by special funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the MLA/V&A Purchase Grant Fund, and two private donations.[174]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Children's literature portal\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n\n\n* Enid Blyton bibliography\n* Enid Blyton Society\n* Enid Blyton's illustrators\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In 1960 alone, eleven Noddy books were published, including the strip books *Noddy and the Runaway Wheel*, *Noddy's Bag of Money*, and *Noddy's Car Gets into Trouble*.[1]\n2. **^** McKellar had written to Blyton in February 1953 asking for the imagery techniques she employed in her writing, for a research project he had undertaken.

Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, he is best remembered for his literary fairy tales.\n\n\nAndersen's fairy tales, consisting of 156 stories across nine volumes,[1] have been translated into more than 125 languages.[2] They have become embedded in Western collective consciousness, accessible to children as well as presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature readers.[3] His most famous fairy tales include \"The Emperor's New Clothes\", \"The Little Mermaid\", \"The Nightingale\", \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\", \"The Red Shoes\", \"The Princess and the Pea\", \"The Snow Queen\", \"The Ugly Duckling\", \"The Little Match Girl\", and \"Thumbelina\". His stories have inspired ballets, plays, and animated and live-action films.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Andersen's childhood home in Odense\nAndersen was born in Odense, Denmark, on 2 April 1805. He had a stepsister named Karen.[5] His father, also named Hans, considered himself related to nobility (his paternal grandmother had told his father that their family had belonged to a higher social class,[6] but investigations have disproved these stories).[6][7] Although it has been challenged,[6] speculation suggests that Andersen was an illegitimate son of King Christian VIII. Danish historian Jens Jørgensen supported this idea in his book *H.C. Andersen, en sand myte* [a true myth].[8]\n\n\nAndersen was baptised on 15 April 1805 in Saint Hans Church in Odense. According to his birth certificate, which was not drafted until November 1823, six godparents were present at the baptising ceremony: Madam Sille Marie Breineberg, Maiden Friederiche Pommer, shoemaker Peder Waltersdorff, journeyman carpenter Anders Jørgensen, hospital porter Nicolas Gomard, and royal hatter Jens Henrichsen Dorch.\n\n\nAndersen's father, who had received an elementary school education, introduced his son to literature, reading him *Arabian Nights*.[9] Andersen's mother, Anne Marie Andersdatter, was an illiterate washerwoman. Following her husband's death in 1816, she remarried in 1818.[9] Andersen was sent to a local school for poor children where he received a basic education and had to support himself, working as an apprentice to a weaver and, later, to a tailor. At fourteen, he moved to Copenhagen to seek employment as an actor. Having a good soprano voice, he was accepted into the Royal Danish Theatre, but his voice soon changed. A colleague at the theatre told him that he considered Andersen a poet, and taking the suggestion seriously, Andersen began to focus on writing.\n\n\nJonas Collin, director of the Royal Danish Theatre, held great affection for Andersen and sent him to a grammar school in Slagelse, persuading King Frederick VI to pay part of his education.[10] Andersen had by then published his first story, \"The Ghost at Palnatoke's Grave\" (1822). Though not a stellar pupil, he also attended school at Elsinore until 1827.[11]\n\n\nHe later said that his years at this school were the darkest and most bitter years of his life. At one school, he lived at his schoolmaster's home. There he was abused and was told that it was done in order \"to improve his character.\" He later said that the faculty had discouraged him from writing, which resulted in a depression.[12]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early work[edit]\n\n\n> \n> It doesn't matter about being born in a duckyard, as long as you are hatched from a swan's egg\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\"The Ugly Duckling\"\n\nA very early fairy tale by Andersen, \"The Tallow Candle\" (Danish: *Tællelyset*), was discovered in a Danish archive in October 2012. The story, written in the 1820s, is about a candle that does not feel appreciated. It was written while Andersen was still in school and dedicated to one of his benefactors. The story remained in that family's possession until it was found among other family papers in a local archive.[13]\n\n\nIn 1829, Andersen enjoyed considerable success with the short story \"A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the East Point of Amager\". Its protagonist meets characters ranging from Saint Peter to a talking cat. Andersen followed this success with a theatrical piece, *Love on St.Nicholas Church Tower*, and a short volume of poems. He made little progress in writing and publishing immediately following these poems, but did receive a small travel grant from the king in 1833. This enabled him to set out on the first of many journeys throughout Europe. At Jura, near Le Locle, Switzerland, Andersen wrote the story \"Agnete and the Merman\". The same year he spent an evening in the Italian seaside village of Sestri Levante, which inspired the title of \"The Bay of Fables\".[14] He arrived in Rome in October 1834. Andersen's travels in Italy were reflected in his first novel, a fictionalized autobiography titled *The Improvisatore* (*Improvisatoren*), published in 1835 to instant acclaim.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Literary fairy tales[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A paper chimney sweep cut by Andersen\n***Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection.*** (Danish: *Eventyr, fortalt for Børn. Første Samling.*) is a collection of nine fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen. The tales were published in a series of three installments by C. A. Reitzel in Copenhagen between May 1835 and April 1837, and were Andersen's first venture into the fairy tale genre.\n\n\nThe first installment of sixty-one unbound pages was published 8 May 1835 and contained \"The Tinderbox\", \"Little Claus and Big Claus\", \"The Princess and the Pea\" and \"Little Ida's Flowers\". The first three tales were based on folktales Andersen had heard in his childhood while the last tale was Andersen's creation for Ida Thiele, the daughter of Andersen's early benefactor, the folklorist Just Mathias Thiele. Reitzel paid Andersen thirty rigsdalers for the manuscript, and the booklet was priced at twenty-four shillings.[17][18]\n\n\nThe second booklet was published on 16 December 1835 and contained \"Thumbelina\", \"The Naughty Boy\", and \"The Traveling Companion\". \"Thumbelina\" was inspired by \"Tom Thumb\" and other stories of miniature people. \"The Naughty Boy\" was based on a poem by Anacreon about Cupid, and \"The Traveling Companion\" was a ghost story Andersen had experimented with in the year 1830.[17]\n\n\nThe third booklet contained \"The Little Mermaid\" and \"The Emperor's New Clothes\", and it was published on 7 April 1837. \"The Little Mermaid\" was influenced by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué's \"Undine\" (1811) and legends about mermaids. This tale established Andersen's international reputation.[19] The only other tale in the third booklet was \"The Emperor's New Clothes\", which was based on a medieval Spanish story with Arab and Jewish origins. On the eve of the third installment's publication, Andersen revised the conclusion (in which the Emperor simply walks in procession) to its now-famous finale of a child calling out, \"The Emperor is not wearing any clothes!\"[20]\n\n\nDanish reviews of the first two booklets first appeared in 1836 and were not enthusiastic. The critics disliked the chatty, informal style and apparent immorality, since children's literature was meant to educate rather than to amuse. The critics discouraged Andersen from pursuing this type of style. Andersen believed that he was working against the critics' preconceived notions about fairy tales, and he temporarily returned to novel-writing, waiting a full year before publishing his third installment.[21]\n\n\nThe nine tales from the three booklets were published in one volume and sold for seventy-two shillings. A title page, a table of contents, and a preface by Andersen were published in this volume.[22]\n\n\nIn 1868 Horace Scudder, the editor of *Riverside Magazine For Young People*, offered Andersen $500 for twelve new stories. Sixteen of Andersen's stories were published in the magazine, and ten of them appeared there before they were printed in Denmark.[23]\n\n\n\n### Travelogues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Andersen by Franz Hanfstaengl, dated July 1860\nIn 1851, he published *In Sweden*, a volume of travel sketches. The publication received wide acclaim. A keen traveler, Andersen published several other long travelogues: *Shadow Pictures of a Journey to the Harz, Swiss Saxony, etc. etc. in the Summer of 1831*, *A Poet's Bazaar*, *In Spain*, and *A Visit to Portugal in 1866*. (The last one describes his visit with his Portuguese friends Jorge and José O'Neill, who he knew in the mid-1820s while he was living in Copenhagen.) In his travelogues, Andersen used contemporary conventions related to travel writing but developed the style to make it his own. Each of his travelogues combines documentary and descriptive accounts of his experiences, adding additional philosophical passages on topics such as authorship, immortality, and fiction in literary travel reports. Some of the travelogues, such as *In Sweden*, contain fairy tales.\n\n\nIn the 1840s, Andersen's attention returned to the theatre stage, but with little success. He had better luck with the publication of the *Picture-Book without Pictures* (1840). He started a second series of fairy tales in 1838 and a third series in 1845. At this point Andersen was celebrated throughout Europe, although his native Denmark still showed some resistance to his pretensions.\n\n\nBetween 1845 and 1864, Andersen lived at Nyhavn 67, Copenhagen, where a memorial plaque is now placed.[24]\n\n\nPatrons of Andersen's writings included the monarchy of Denmark, the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. An unexpected invitation from King Christian IX to the royal palace entrenched Andersen's folklore in Danish royalty as well as making its way to the Romanov dynasty when Christian IX's daughter Maria Feodorovna married Alexander III of Russia.[25]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Søren Kierkegaard[edit]\n\n\nIn \"Andersen as a Novelist\", Søren Kierkegaard remarks that Andersen is characterized as \"a possibility of a personality, wrapped up in such a web of arbitrary moods and moving through an elegiac duo-decimal scaled of almost echoless, dying tones just as easily roused as subdued, who, in order to become a personality, needs a strong life-development.\"[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)Andersen statue at the Rosenborg Castle Gardens, Copenhagen\n### Meetings with Charles Dickens[edit]\n\n\nIn June 1847, Andersen visited England for the first time, enjoying triumphant social success. The Countess of Blessington invited him to her parties where many intellectuals would meet, and at one such party he met Charles Dickens for the first time. They shook hands and walked to the veranda, which Andersen noted in his diary: \"We were on the veranda, and I was so happy to see and speak to England's now-living writer whom I do love the most.\"[27]\n\n\nThe two authors respected each other's work and as writers, and had in common their depictions of the underclass who often had difficult lives affected both by the Industrial Revolution and by abject poverty.\n\n\nTen years later, Andersen visited England again, primarily to meet Dickens. He extended the planned brief visit to Dickens' home at Gads Hill Place into a five-week stay, much to the distress of Dickens' family. After Andersen was told to leave, Dickens gradually stopped all correspondence between them, to Andersen's great disappointment and confusion; he had enjoyed the visit and never understood why his letters went unanswered.[27]\n\n\nIt is suspected that Dickens modeled the physical appearance and mannerisms of Uriah Heep from *David Copperfield* after Andersen.[28]\n\n\n\n### Romantic relationships[edit]\n\n\nIn Andersen's early life, his private journal records his refusal to have sexual relations.[29][30]\n\n\nAndersen experienced homosexual attraction;[31] he wrote to Edvard Collin:[32] \"I languish for you as for a pretty Calabrian wench ... my sentiments for you are those of a woman. The femininity of my nature and our friendship must remain a mystery.\"[33] Collin wrote in his own memoir, \"I found myself unable to respond to this love, and this caused the author much suffering.\" Andersen's infatuation with Karl Alexander, the young hereditary duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach,[34] did result in a relationship:\n\n\n\n\n> The Hereditary Grand Duke walked arm in arm with me across the courtyard of the castle to my room, kissed me lovingly, asked me always to love him though he was just an ordinary person, asked me to stay with him this winter ... Fell asleep with the melancholy, happy feeling that I was the guest of this strange prince at his castle and loved by him ... It is like a fairy tale.[31] \n> \n> \n\n\nThere is a sharp division in opinion over Andersen's physical fulfillment in the sexual sphere. Jackie Wullschlager's biography maintains he was possibly lovers with Danish dancer Harald Scharff [da][35] and Andersen's \"The Snowman\" was inspired by their relationship.[36] Scharff first met Andersen when the latter was in his fifties. Andersen was infatuated and Wullschlager sees his journals as implying that their relationship was sexual.[37] Scharff had various dinners alone with Andersen and gifted a silver toothbrush to Andersen on his fifty-seventh birthday.[38] Wullschlager asserts that in the winter of 1861–62, the two men entered an affair that brought Andersen \"joy, some kind of sexual fulfillment, and a temporary end to loneliness.\"[39] He was not discreet in his conduct with Scharff, and displayed his feelings openly. Onlookers regarded the relationship as improper and ridiculous. In his diary on March 1862, Andersen referred to this time in his life as his \"erotic period\".[40] On 13 November 1863, Andersen wrote, \"Scharff has not visited me in eight days; with him it is over.\"[41] Andersen took this calmly and the two thereafter met in overlapping social circles without bitterness, though Andersen attempted to rekindle their relationship a number of times without success.[42][note 1][note 2][43]\n\n\nIn opposition to Wullschlager's assertions are Klara Bom and Anya Aarenstrup from the H. C. Andersen Centre of University of Southern Denmark. They state \"it is correct to point to the very ambivalent (and also very traumatic) elements in Andersen's emotional life concerning the sexual sphere, but it is decidedly just as wrong to describe him as homosexual and maintain that he had physical relationships with men. He did not. Indeed, that would have been entirely contrary to his moral and religious ideas, aspects that are quite outside the field of vision of Wullschlager and her like.\"[44]\n\n\nAndersen also fell in love with unattainable women, and many interpret references to them in his stories.[45] At one point, he wrote in his diary: \"Almighty God, thee only have I; thou steerest my fate, I must give myself up to thee! Give me a livelihood! Give me a bride! My blood wants love, as my heart does!\"[46] A girl named Riborg Voigt was the unrequited love of Andersen's youth. A small pouch containing a long letter from Voigt was found on Andersen's chest when he died, several decades after he first fell in love with her. Other disappointments in love included Sophie Ørsted,[*citation needed*] the daughter of the physicist Hans Christian Ørsted; and Louise Collin,[*citation needed*] the youngest daughter of his benefactor Jonas Collin. One of his stories, \"The Nightingale\", was written as an expression of his passion for Jenny Lind and was the inspiration for her nickname, the \"Swedish Nightingale\".[47] Andersen was shy around women and had extreme difficulty proposing to Lind. When Lind was boarding a train to go to an opera concert, Andersen gave Lind a letter of proposal. Her feelings towards him were not the same; she saw him as a brother, writing to him in 1844: \"farewell ... God bless and protect my brother is the sincere wish of his affectionate sister, Jenny\".[48] It is suggested that Andersen expressed his disappointment by portraying Lind as the eponymous antihero of The Snow Queen.[49]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Andersen at Rolighed: Israel Melchior (c. 1867)\nIn early 1872, at age 67, Andersen fell out of his bed and was severely hurt; he never fully recovered from the resultant injuries. Soon afterward, he started to show signs of liver cancer.[50]\n\n\nHe died on 4 August 1875, in a country house called *Rolighed* (literally: calmness) near Copenhagen, the home of his close friends, the banker Moritz G. Melchior and his wife.[50] Shortly before his death, Andersen consulted a composer about the music for his funeral, saying: \"Most of the people who will walk after me will be children, so make the beat keep time with little steps.\"[50]\n\n\nHis body was interred in the Assistens Kirkegård in the Nørrebro area of Copenhagen, in the Collin family plot. In 1914, the headstone was moved to another cemetery (today known as *\"*Frederiksbergs ældre kirkegaard\"), where younger Collin family members were buried. For a period, his, Edvard Collin's, and Henriette Collin's graves were unmarked. A second stone has been erected, marking Andersen's grave, now without any mention of the Collin couple, but all three still share the same plot.[51]\n\n\nAt the time of his death, Andersen was internationally revered, and the Danish government paid him an annual stipend for being a \"national treasure\".[52]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Archives, collections and museums[edit]\n\n\n* The Hans Christian Andersen Museum or H.C. Andersens Hus, is a set of museums/buildings dedicated to Hans Christian Andersen in Odense, Denmark, some of which, at various times in history, have functioned as the main Odense-based museum for the author.\n* The Hans Christian Andersen Museum in Solvang, California, a city founded by Danes, is devoted to presenting the author's life and works.

Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, he is best remembered for his literary fairy tales.\n\n\nAndersen's fairy tales, consisting of 156 stories across nine volumes,[1] have been translated into more than 125 languages.[2] They have become embedded in Western collective consciousness, accessible to children as well as presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature readers.[3] His most famous fairy tales include \"The Emperor's New Clothes\", \"The Little Mermaid\", \"The Nightingale\", \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\", \"The Red Shoes\", \"The Princess and the Pea\", \"The Snow Queen\", \"The Ugly Duckling\", \"The Little Match Girl\", and \"Thumbelina\". His stories have inspired ballets, plays, and animated and live-action films.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Andersen's childhood home in Odense\nAndersen was born in Odense, Denmark, on 2 April 1805. He had a stepsister named Karen.[5] His father, also named Hans, considered himself related to nobility (his paternal grandmother had told his father that their family had belonged to a higher social class,[6] but investigations have disproved these stories).[6][7] Although it has been challenged,[6] speculation suggests that Andersen was an illegitimate son of King Christian VIII. Danish historian Jens Jørgensen supported this idea in his book *H.C. Andersen, en sand myte* [a true myth].[8]\n\n\nAndersen was baptised on 15 April 1805 in Saint Hans Church in Odense. According to his birth certificate, which was not drafted until November 1823, six godparents were present at the baptising ceremony: Madam Sille Marie Breineberg, Maiden Friederiche Pommer, shoemaker Peder Waltersdorff, journeyman carpenter Anders Jørgensen, hospital porter Nicolas Gomard, and royal hatter Jens Henrichsen Dorch.\n\n\nAndersen's father, who had received an elementary school education, introduced his son to literature, reading him *Arabian Nights*.[9] Andersen's mother, Anne Marie Andersdatter, was an illiterate washerwoman. Following her husband's death in 1816, she remarried in 1818.[9] Andersen was sent to a local school for poor children where he received a basic education and had to support himself, working as an apprentice to a weaver and, later, to a tailor. At fourteen, he moved to Copenhagen to seek employment as an actor. Having a good soprano voice, he was accepted into the Royal Danish Theatre, but his voice soon changed. A colleague at the theatre told him that he considered Andersen a poet, and taking the suggestion seriously, Andersen began to focus on writing.\n\n\nJonas Collin, director of the Royal Danish Theatre, held great affection for Andersen and sent him to a grammar school in Slagelse, persuading King Frederick VI to pay part of his education.[10] Andersen had by then published his first story, \"The Ghost at Palnatoke's Grave\" (1822). Though not a stellar pupil, he also attended school at Elsinore until 1827.[11]\n\n\nHe later said that his years at this school were the darkest and most bitter years of his life. At one school, he lived at his schoolmaster's home. There he was abused and was told that it was done in order \"to improve his character.\" He later said that the faculty had discouraged him from writing, which resulted in a depression.[12]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early work[edit]\n\n\n> \n> It doesn't matter about being born in a duckyard, as long as you are hatched from a swan's egg\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\"The Ugly Duckling\"\n\nA very early fairy tale by Andersen, \"The Tallow Candle\" (Danish: *Tællelyset*), was discovered in a Danish archive in October 2012. The story, written in the 1820s, is about a candle that does not feel appreciated. It was written while Andersen was still in school and dedicated to one of his benefactors. The story remained in that family's possession until it was found among other family papers in a local archive.[13]\n\n\nIn 1829, Andersen enjoyed considerable success with the short story \"A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the East Point of Amager\". Its protagonist meets characters ranging from Saint Peter to a talking cat. Andersen followed this success with a theatrical piece, *Love on St.Nicholas Church Tower*, and a short volume of poems. He made little progress in writing and publishing immediately following these poems, but did receive a small travel grant from the king in 1833. This enabled him to set out on the first of many journeys throughout Europe. At Jura, near Le Locle, Switzerland, Andersen wrote the story \"Agnete and the Merman\". The same year he spent an evening in the Italian seaside village of Sestri Levante, which inspired the title of \"The Bay of Fables\".[14] He arrived in Rome in October 1834. Andersen's travels in Italy were reflected in his first novel, a fictionalized autobiography titled *The Improvisatore* (*Improvisatoren*), published in 1835 to instant acclaim.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Literary fairy tales[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A paper chimney sweep cut by Andersen\n***Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection.*** (Danish: *Eventyr, fortalt for Børn. Første Samling.*) is a collection of nine fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen. The tales were published in a series of three installments by C. A. Reitzel in Copenhagen between May 1835 and April 1837, and were Andersen's first venture into the fairy tale genre.\n\n\nThe first installment of sixty-one unbound pages was published 8 May 1835 and contained \"The Tinderbox\", \"Little Claus and Big Claus\", \"The Princess and the Pea\" and \"Little Ida's Flowers\". The first three tales were based on folktales Andersen had heard in his childhood while the last tale was Andersen's creation for Ida Thiele, the daughter of Andersen's early benefactor, the folklorist Just Mathias Thiele. Reitzel paid Andersen thirty rigsdalers for the manuscript, and the booklet was priced at twenty-four shillings.[17][18]\n\n\nThe second booklet was published on 16 December 1835 and contained \"Thumbelina\", \"The Naughty Boy\", and \"The Traveling Companion\". \"Thumbelina\" was inspired by \"Tom Thumb\" and other stories of miniature people. \"The Naughty Boy\" was based on a poem by Anacreon about Cupid, and \"The Traveling Companion\" was a ghost story Andersen had experimented with in the year 1830.[17]\n\n\nThe third booklet contained \"The Little Mermaid\" and \"The Emperor's New Clothes\", and it was published on 7 April 1837. \"The Little Mermaid\" was influenced by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué's \"Undine\" (1811) and legends about mermaids. This tale established Andersen's international reputation.[19] The only other tale in the third booklet was \"The Emperor's New Clothes\", which was based on a medieval Spanish story with Arab and Jewish origins. On the eve of the third installment's publication, Andersen revised the conclusion (in which the Emperor simply walks in procession) to its now-famous finale of a child calling out, \"The Emperor is not wearing any clothes!\"[20]\n\n\nDanish reviews of the first two booklets first appeared in 1836 and were not enthusiastic. The critics disliked the chatty, informal style and apparent immorality, since children's literature was meant to educate rather than to amuse. The critics discouraged Andersen from pursuing this type of style. Andersen believed that he was working against the critics' preconceived notions about fairy tales, and he temporarily returned to novel-writing, waiting a full year before publishing his third installment.[21]\n\n\nThe nine tales from the three booklets were published in one volume and sold for seventy-two shillings. A title page, a table of contents, and a preface by Andersen were published in this volume.[22]\n\n\nIn 1868 Horace Scudder, the editor of *Riverside Magazine For Young People*, offered Andersen $500 for twelve new stories. Sixteen of Andersen's stories were published in the magazine, and ten of them appeared there before they were printed in Denmark.[23]\n\n\n\n### Travelogues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Andersen by Franz Hanfstaengl, dated July 1860\nIn 1851, he published *In Sweden*, a volume of travel sketches. The publication received wide acclaim. A keen traveler, Andersen published several other long travelogues: *Shadow Pictures of a Journey to the Harz, Swiss Saxony, etc. etc. in the Summer of 1831*, *A Poet's Bazaar*, *In Spain*, and *A Visit to Portugal in 1866*. (The last one describes his visit with his Portuguese friends Jorge and José O'Neill, who he knew in the mid-1820s while he was living in Copenhagen.) In his travelogues, Andersen used contemporary conventions related to travel writing but developed the style to make it his own. Each of his travelogues combines documentary and descriptive accounts of his experiences, adding additional philosophical passages on topics such as authorship, immortality, and fiction in literary travel reports. Some of the travelogues, such as *In Sweden*, contain fairy tales.\n\n\nIn the 1840s, Andersen's attention returned to the theatre stage, but with little success. He had better luck with the publication of the *Picture-Book without Pictures* (1840). He started a second series of fairy tales in 1838 and a third series in 1845. At this point Andersen was celebrated throughout Europe, although his native Denmark still showed some resistance to his pretensions.\n\n\nBetween 1845 and 1864, Andersen lived at Nyhavn 67, Copenhagen, where a memorial plaque is now placed.[24]\n\n\nPatrons of Andersen's writings included the monarchy of Denmark, the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. An unexpected invitation from King Christian IX to the royal palace entrenched Andersen's folklore in Danish royalty as well as making its way to the Romanov dynasty when Christian IX's daughter Maria Feodorovna married Alexander III of Russia.[25]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Søren Kierkegaard[edit]\n\n\nIn \"Andersen as a Novelist\", Søren Kierkegaard remarks that Andersen is characterized as \"a possibility of a personality, wrapped up in such a web of arbitrary moods and moving through an elegiac duo-decimal scaled of almost echoless, dying tones just as easily roused as subdued, who, in order to become a personality, needs a strong life-development.\"[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)Andersen statue at the Rosenborg Castle Gardens, Copenhagen\n### Meetings with Charles Dickens[edit]\n\n\nIn June 1847, Andersen visited England for the first time, enjoying triumphant social success. The Countess of Blessington invited him to her parties where many intellectuals would meet, and at one such party he met Charles Dickens for the first time. They shook hands and walked to the veranda, which Andersen noted in his diary: \"We were on the veranda, and I was so happy to see and speak to England's now-living writer whom I do love the most.\"[27]\n\n\nThe two authors respected each other's work and as writers, and had in common their depictions of the underclass who often had difficult lives affected both by the Industrial Revolution and by abject poverty.\n\n\nTen years later, Andersen visited England again, primarily to meet Dickens. He extended the planned brief visit to Dickens' home at Gads Hill Place into a five-week stay, much to the distress of Dickens' family. After Andersen was told to leave, Dickens gradually stopped all correspondence between them, to Andersen's great disappointment and confusion; he had enjoyed the visit and never understood why his letters went unanswered.[27]\n\n\nIt is suspected that Dickens modeled the physical appearance and mannerisms of Uriah Heep from *David Copperfield* after Andersen.[28]\n\n\n\n### Romantic relationships[edit]\n\n\nIn Andersen's early life, his private journal records his refusal to have sexual relations.[29][30]\n\n\nAndersen experienced homosexual attraction;[31] he wrote to Edvard Collin:[32] \"I languish for you as for a pretty Calabrian wench ... my sentiments for you are those of a woman. The femininity of my nature and our friendship must remain a mystery.\"[33] Collin wrote in his own memoir, \"I found myself unable to respond to this love, and this caused the author much suffering.\" Andersen's infatuation with Karl Alexander, the young hereditary duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach,[34] did result in a relationship:\n\n\n\n\n> The Hereditary Grand Duke walked arm in arm with me across the courtyard of the castle to my room, kissed me lovingly, asked me always to love him though he was just an ordinary person, asked me to stay with him this winter ... Fell asleep with the melancholy, happy feeling that I was the guest of this strange prince at his castle and loved by him ... It is like a fairy tale.[31] \n> \n> \n\n\nThere is a sharp division in opinion over Andersen's physical fulfillment in the sexual sphere. Jackie Wullschlager's biography maintains he was possibly lovers with Danish dancer Harald Scharff [da][35] and Andersen's \"The Snowman\" was inspired by their relationship.[36] Scharff first met Andersen when the latter was in his fifties. Andersen was infatuated and Wullschlager sees his journals as implying that their relationship was sexual.[37] Scharff had various dinners alone with Andersen and gifted a silver toothbrush to Andersen on his fifty-seventh birthday.[38] Wullschlager asserts that in the winter of 1861–62, the two men entered an affair that brought Andersen \"joy, some kind of sexual fulfillment, and a temporary end to loneliness.\"[39] He was not discreet in his conduct with Scharff, and displayed his feelings openly. Onlookers regarded the relationship as improper and ridiculous. In his diary on March 1862, Andersen referred to this time in his life as his \"erotic period\".[40] On 13 November 1863, Andersen wrote, \"Scharff has not visited me in eight days; with him it is over.\"[41] Andersen took this calmly and the two thereafter met in overlapping social circles without bitterness, though Andersen attempted to rekindle their relationship a number of times without success.[42][note 1][note 2][43]\n\n\nIn opposition to Wullschlager's assertions are Klara Bom and Anya Aarenstrup from the H. C. Andersen Centre of University of Southern Denmark. They state \"it is correct to point to the very ambivalent (and also very traumatic) elements in Andersen's emotional life concerning the sexual sphere, but it is decidedly just as wrong to describe him as homosexual and maintain that he had physical relationships with men. He did not. Indeed, that would have been entirely contrary to his moral and religious ideas, aspects that are quite outside the field of vision of Wullschlager and her like.\"[44]\n\n\nAndersen also fell in love with unattainable women, and many interpret references to them in his stories.[45] At one point, he wrote in his diary: \"Almighty God, thee only have I; thou steerest my fate, I must give myself up to thee! Give me a livelihood! Give me a bride! My blood wants love, as my heart does!\"[46] A girl named Riborg Voigt was the unrequited love of Andersen's youth. A small pouch containing a long letter from Voigt was found on Andersen's chest when he died, several decades after he first fell in love with her. Other disappointments in love included Sophie Ørsted,[*citation needed*] the daughter of the physicist Hans Christian Ørsted; and Louise Collin,[*citation needed*] the youngest daughter of his benefactor Jonas Collin. One of his stories, \"The Nightingale\", was written as an expression of his passion for Jenny Lind and was the inspiration for her nickname, the \"Swedish Nightingale\".[47] Andersen was shy around women and had extreme difficulty proposing to Lind. When Lind was boarding a train to go to an opera concert, Andersen gave Lind a letter of proposal. Her feelings towards him were not the same; she saw him as a brother, writing to him in 1844: \"farewell ... God bless and protect my brother is the sincere wish of his affectionate sister, Jenny\".[48] It is suggested that Andersen expressed his disappointment by portraying Lind as the eponymous antihero of The Snow Queen.[49]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Andersen at Rolighed: Israel Melchior (c. 1867)\nIn early 1872, at age 67, Andersen fell out of his bed and was severely hurt; he never fully recovered from the resultant injuries. Soon afterward, he started to show signs of liver cancer.[50]\n\n\nHe died on 4 August 1875, in a country house called *Rolighed* (literally: calmness) near Copenhagen, the home of his close friends, the banker Moritz G. Melchior and his wife.[50] Shortly before his death, Andersen consulted a composer about the music for his funeral, saying: \"Most of the people who will walk after me will be children, so make the beat keep time with little steps.\"[50]\n\n\nHis body was interred in the Assistens Kirkegård in the Nørrebro area of Copenhagen, in the Collin family plot. In 1914, the headstone was moved to another cemetery (today known as *\"*Frederiksbergs ældre kirkegaard\"), where younger Collin family members were buried. For a period, his, Edvard Collin's, and Henriette Collin's graves were unmarked. A second stone has been erected, marking Andersen's grave, now without any mention of the Collin couple, but all three still share the same plot.[51]\n\n\nAt the time of his death, Andersen was internationally revered, and the Danish government paid him an annual stipend for being a \"national treasure\".[52]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Archives, collections and museums[edit]\n\n\n* The Hans Christian Andersen Museum or H.C.
