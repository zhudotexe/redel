After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Xi's father held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice chairperson of the National People's Congress.[3] Xi had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao, born in 1949 and An'an (安安; *Ān'ān*), born in 1952.[4][5] Xi's father was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.[6][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** Bull, Alister; Buckley, Chris (24 January 2012). \"China leader-in-waiting Xi to visit White House next month\". *Reuters*.

He was promoted in 1983 to secretary, becoming the top official of the county.[23] Xi subsequently served in four provinces during his regional political career: Hebei (1982–1985), Fujian (1985–2002), Zhejiang (2002–2007), and Shanghai (2007).[24] Xi held posts in the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1997, he was named an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the CCP. However, of the 151 alternate members of the Central Committee elected at the 15th Party Congress, Xi received the lowest number of votes in favour, placing him last in the rankings of members, ostensibly due to his status as a princeling.[b][25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n476. **^** Forsythe, Michael (17 June 2012). \"As China's Leader Fights Graft, His Relatives Shed Assets\". *The New York Times*.

He lived in a yaodong in the village of Liangjiahe, Shaanxi province, where he joined the CCP after several failed attempts and worked as the local party secretary. After studying chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student, Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of Fujian from 1999 to 2002, before becoming governor and party secretary of neighboring Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He subsequently joined the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) of the CCP the same year and served as first secretary of the Central Secretariat in October 2007. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPolitical leaders of Shanghai since 1949\n |\n| --- |\n| Party CommitteeSecretaries | * Rao Shushi\n* Chen Yi\n* Ke Qingshi\n* Chen Pixian\n* Zhang Chunqiao\n* Su Zhenhua\n* Peng Chong\n* Chen Guodong\n* Rui Xingwen\n* Jiang Zemin\n* Zhu Rongji\n* Wu Bangguo\n* Huang Ju\n* Chen Liangyu\n* Han Zheng (acting)\n* Xi Jinping\n* Yu Zhengsheng\n* Han Zheng\n* Li Qiang\n* Chen Jining\n |\n| CongressChairpersons | * Yan Youmin\n* Hu Lijiao\n* Ye Gongqi\n* Chen Tiedi\n* Gong Xueping\n* Liu Yungeng\n* Yin Yicui ♀\n* Jiang Zhuoqing\n* Dong Yunhu\n* Huang Lixin ♀\n |\n| Mayors | * Chen Yi\n* Ke Qingshi\n* Cao Diqiu\n* Zhang Chunqiao\n* Su Zhenhua\n* Peng Chong\n* Wang Daohan\n* Jiang Zemin\n* Zhu Rongji\n* Huang Ju\n* Xu Kuangdi\n* Chen Liangyu\n* Han Zheng\n* Yang Xiong\n* Ying Yong\n* Gong Zheng\n |\n| ConferenceChairpersons | * Ke Qingshi\n* Chen Pixian\n* Peng Chong\n* Wang Yiping\n* Li Guohao\n* Xie Xide ♀\n* Chen Tiedi ♀\n* Wang Liping\n* Jiang Yiren\n* Feng Guoqin\n* Wu Zhiming\n* Dong Yunhu\n* Hu Wenrong\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 8th Vice President of the People's Republic of China |\n| **In office**15 March 2008 – 14 March 2013 |\n| President | Hu Jintao |\n| Preceded by | Zeng Qinghong |\n| Succeeded by | Li Yuanchao |\n|  |\n| Personal details |\n| Born |  (1953-06-15) 15 June 1953 (age 70)Beijing, China |\n| Political party | CCP (since 1974) |\n| Spouses | * Ke Lingling\n\n​\n ​\n(m. 1979; div. 1982)​\n* Peng Liyuan\n ​\n(m. 1987)​\n |\n| Children | Xi Mingze |\n| Parents | * Xi Zhongxun (father)\n* Qi Xin (mother)\n |\n| Relatives | * Xi Yuanping (brother)\n* Qi Qiaoqiao (sister)\n* Deng Jiagui (brother-in-law)\n* Zhang Lanlan (sister-in-law)\n |\n| Residence | Zhongnanhai |\n| Alma mater | Tsinghua University |\n| Signature | ![](image) |\n| Website | www.gov.cn (in Chinese) |\n| Xi Jinping's voice\n\n\nRecorded 30 June 2021\n\n |\n|  |\n| Chinese name |\n| Simplified Chinese | 习近平 |\n| Traditional Chinese | 習近平 |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n67. **^** Chen, Zhuang (10 December 2012). \"The symbolism of Xi Jinping's trip south\". *BBC News*.

They divorced within a few years.[468] The two were said to fight \"almost every day\", and after the divorce Ke moved to England.[8] In 1987, Xi married the prominent Chinese folk singer Peng Liyuan.[469] Xi and Peng were introduced by friends as many Chinese couples were in the 1980s. Xi was reputedly academic during their courtship, inquiring about singing techniques.[470] Peng Liyuan, a household name in China, was better known to the public than Xi until his political elevation. The couple frequently lived apart due largely to their separate professional lives. Peng has played a much more visible role as China's \"first lady\" compared to her predecessors; for example, Peng hosted U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama on her high-profile visit to China in March 2014.[471]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Association for Conversation of Hong Kong Indigenous Languages Online Dictionary\". *hkilang.org*. 1 July 2015.

Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align two more powerful posts—general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC—which have no term limits. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n20th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (2022–2027)\n |\n| --- |\n| Standing Committee | 1.

Former prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, when asked about Xi, said he felt he was \"a thoughtful man who has gone through many trials and tribulations\".[43] Lee also commented: \"I would put him in the Nelson Mandela class of persons. A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgment. In other words, he is impressive\".[44] Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson described Xi as \"the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line\".[45] Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd said that Xi \"has sufficient reformist, party and military background to be very much his own man\".[46]\n\n\n\n### Trips as Vice President[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nXi was appointed to the nine-man PSC at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. He was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that he was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China's next leader. In addition, Xi also held the first secretary of the CCP's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress in March 2008, when Xi was elected as vice president of the PRC.[38] Following his elevation, Xi held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new president of the Central Party School of the CCP, its cadre-training and ideological education wing. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n105. **^** \"China elevates Xi to most powerful leader in decades\". *CBC News*. 24 October 2017.

Deng had two shell companies in the British Virgin Islands while Xi was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, but they were dormant by the time Xi became general secretary of the CCP in November 2012.[478]\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nXi is the first CCP general secretary born after the establishment of the PRC. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His anti-corruption campaign led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the PSC. He has also enacted or promoted a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to China's relations with the U.S., the nine-dash line in the South China Sea, the Sino-Indian border dispute, and the political status of Taiwan. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the Belt and Road Initiative. Xi has expanded support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), advanced military-civil fusion, overseen targeted poverty alleviation programs, and has attempted to reform the property sector. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| New Zhijiang Army | * Cai Qi\n* Chen Min'er\n* Huang Kunming\n* Lou Yangsheng\n* Bayanqolu\n* Ying Yong\n* Li Qiang\n* Ding Xuexiang\n* Zhong Shaojun\n |\n| Works | * *General Secretary Xi Jinping important speech series*\n* *The Governance of China*\n* *The Hopes of President Xi*\n* *Zhijiang Xinyu*\n* *Quotations from Chairman Xi Jinping*\n |\n| Family | * Xi Zhongxun (father)\n* Qi Xin (mother)\n* Ke Lingling (1st wife)\n* Peng Liyuan (2nd wife)\n* Qi Qiaoqiao (sister)\n* Xi Yuanping (brother)\n* Xi Mingze (daughter)\n |\n| Related | * *Amazing China*\n* Accelerator-in-Chief\n* Censorship of Winnie-the-Pooh\n* Cult of personality\n* Panama Papers (Deng Jiagui)\n* Open Letter asking Xi Jinping to Resign\n* *Rhyzodiastes xii*\n* *General Secretary Xi Jinping's Kindness We Never Forget*\n* *Xuexi Qiangguo*\n |\n| * **![](image) Category:Xi Jinping**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLater, his mother was forced to publicly denounce his father, as he was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. His father was later imprisoned in 1968 when Xi was aged 15. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement.[14] He worked as the party secretary of Liangjiahe, where he lived in a cave house.[15] According to people who knew him, this experience led him to feel affinity with the rural poor.[16] After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches, but he later returned to the village. He then spent a total of seven years there.[17][18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nXi was elected president on 14 March 2013, in a confirmation vote by the 12th National People's Congress in Beijing. He received 2,952 for, one vote against, and three abstentions.[60] He replaced Hu Jintao, who retired after serving two terms.[68] In his new capacity as president, on 16 March 2013 Xi expressed support for non-interference in China–Sri Lanka relations amid a United Nations Security Council vote to condemn that country over government abuses during the Sri Lankan Civil War.[69] On 17 March, Xi and his new ministers arranged a meeting with the chief executive of Hong Kong, CY Leung, confirming his support for Leung.[70] Within hours of his election, Xi discussed cyber security and North Korea with U.S. President Barack Obama over the phone. Obama announced the visits of treasury and state secretaries Jacob Lew and John F. Kerry to China the following week.[71]\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xi Jinping Administration\n\n### Anti-corruption campaign[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe pledged there would be no 'purges' during his administration, despite the fact many local officials were thought to have been implicated in the Chen Liangyu corruption scandal.[36] On most issues, Xi largely echoed the line of the central leadership.[37]\n\n\n\n## Rise to power[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOften described as an authoritarian leader by political and academic observers, Xi's tenure has included an increase of censorship and mass surveillance, deterioration in human rights, including the internment of one million Uyghurs in Xinjiang (which some observers have described as part of a genocide), a cult of personality developing around Xi, and the removal of term limits for the presidency in 2018. Xi's political ideas and principles, known as Xi Jinping Thought, have been incorporated into the party and national constitutions, and he has emphasized the importance of national security and the need for CCP leadership over the country. As the central figure of the fifth generation of leadership of the PRC, Xi has centralized institutional power by taking on multiple positions, including chairing the National Security Commission and new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2002, Xi left Fujian and took up leading political positions in neighbouring Zhejiang. He eventually took over as provincial Party Committee secretary after several months as acting governor, occupying a top provincial office for the first time in his career. In 2002, he was elected a full member of the 16th Central Committee, marking his ascension to the national stage. While in Zhejiang, Xi presided over reported growth rates averaging 14% per year.[30] His career in Zhejiang was marked by a tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials. This earned him a name in the national media and drew the attention of China's top leaders.[31] Between 2004 and 2007, Li Qiang acted as Xi's chief of staff through his position as secretary-general of the Zhejiang Party Committee, where they both developed close ties.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** \"Zhao Leji elected chairman of China's 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee\". *Xinhua News Agency*. 10 March 2023.

This was the third of its kind after ones adopted by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping,[126][127] and the document for the first time credited Xi as being the \"main innovator\" of Xi Jinping Thought[128] while also declaring Xi's leadership as being \"the key to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\".[129] In comparison with the other historical resolutions, Xi's one did not herald a major change in how the CCP evaluated its history.[130] To accompany the historical resolution, the CCP promoted the terms Two Establishes and Two Safeguards, calling the CCP to unite around and protect Xi's core status within the party.[131] In 2022, Xi appointed his close ally Wang Xiaohong as the Minister of Public Security, giving him further control over the security establishment.[132]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVolume one was published in September 2014, followed by volume two in November 2017.[465]\n\n\nAn app for teaching Xi Jinping Thought had become the most popular smartphone app in China in 2019, as the country's ruling CCP launched a new campaign that calls on its cadres to immerse themselves in the political doctrine every day. *Xuexi Qiangguo* is now the most downloaded item on Apple's domestic App Store, surpassing in demand social media apps such as WeChat and TikTok.[466] In 2021, the government included Xi Jinping Thought in the curriculum including to students from primary schools to university, which created pushback from parents. For much of the preceding 30 years, political ideology and communist doctrine were not a standard taught in Chinese schools until middle school, and textbooks featured a wider set of Chinese leaders with less emphasis on a single leader like Xi.[467]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the dismissal of Shanghai Party secretary Chen Liangyu in September 2006 due to a social security fund scandal, Xi was transferred to Shanghai in March 2007, where he was the party secretary there for seven months.[33][34] In Shanghai, Xi avoided controversy and was known for strictly observing party discipline. For example, Shanghai administrators attempted to earn favour with him by arranging a special train to shuttle him between Shanghai and Hangzhou for him to complete handing off his work to his successor as Zhejiang party secretary Zhao Hongzhu. However, Xi reportedly refused to take the train, citing a loosely enforced party regulation that stipulated that special trains can only be reserved for \"national leaders\".[35] While in Shanghai, he worked on preserving unity of the local party organisation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n516. **^** Dailey, Kate (15 February 2012). \"The early adventures of Xi Jinping\".

In Fujian, Xi made efforts to attract investment from Taiwan and to strengthen the private sector of the provincial economy.[28] In February 2000, he and then-provincial party secretary Chen Mingyi were called before the top members of PSC – general secretary Jiang Zemin, premier Zhu Rongji, vice president Hu Jintao and Discipline Inspection secretary Wei Jianxing – to explain aspects of the Yuanhua scandal.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter seven rejections, Xi joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1971 on his eighth attempt after he befriended a local official.[8] He reunited with his father in 1972, because of a family reunion ordered by premier Zhou Enlai.[13] From 1973, he applied to join the CCP ten times and was finally accepted on his tenth attempt in 1974.[19][20][21] From 1975 to 1979, Xi studied chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student in Beijing. The engineering majors there spent about 15 percent of their time studying Marxism–Leninism–Maoism and 5 percent of their time doing farm work and \"learning from the People's Liberation Army\".[22]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| First term | * 2012 election as Party general secretary\n* Anti-corruption campaign\n\t+ Wang Qishan (2012–2017)\n* World Internet Conference\n* 709 crackdown\n* Toilet Revolution in China\n* 2015 China Victory Day Parade\n |\n| Second term | * 2017 reelection as Party general secretary\n* Persecution of Uyghurs in China\n\t+ Xinjiang internment camps\n* China–United States trade war\n* 2019–20 Hong Kong protests\n* 2019 China 70th National Day grand parade\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n\t+ Response\n* 100th Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party\n* 2020 Inner Mongolia protests\n* 2020-2021 Xi Jinping Administration reform spree\n* 2022 Winter Olympics\n* 2022 Hong Kong visit\n |\n| Third term | * 2022 2nd reelection as Party general secretary\n |\n\n |\n| Diplomacy | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe following day Xi led the new line-up of the PSC onto the stage in their first public appearance.[60] The PSC was reduced from nine to seven, with only Xi and Li Keqiang retaining their seats; the other five members were new.[61][62][63] In a marked departure from the common practice of Chinese leaders, Xi's first speech as general secretary was plainly worded and did not include any political slogans or mention his predecessors.[64] Xi mentioned the aspirations of the average person, remarking, \"Our people ... expect better education, more stable jobs, better income, more reliable social security, medical care of a higher standard, more comfortable living conditions, and a more beautiful environment.\" Xi also vowed to tackle corruption at the highest levels, alluding that it would threaten the CCP's survival; he was reticent about far-reaching economic reforms.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn December 2012, Xi visited Guangdong in his first trip outside Beijing since taking the Party leadership. The overarching theme of the trip was to call for further economic reform and a strengthened military. Xi visited the statue of Deng Xiaoping and his trip was described as following in the footsteps of Deng's own southern trip in 1992, which provided the impetus for further economic reforms in China after conservative party leaders stalled many of Deng's reforms in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. On his trip, Xi consistently alluded to his signature slogan, the \"Chinese Dream\". \"This dream can be said to be the dream of a strong nation. And for the military, it is a dream of a strong military\", Xi told sailors.[66] Xi's trip was significant in that he departed from the established convention of Chinese leaders' travel routines in multiple ways. Rather than dining out, Xi and his entourage ate regular hotel buffet. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping greeting U.S. president George W.

His Politburo Standing Committee colleagues, in their own reviews of Xi's keynote address at the Congress, prepended the name \"Xi Jinping\" in front of \"Thought\".[463] On 24 October 2017, at its closing session, the 19th Party Congress approved the incorporation of Xi Jinping Thought into the Constitution of the CCP,[104] while in March 2018, the National People's Congress changed the state constitution to include Xi Jinping Thought.[464]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n460. **^** Xi, Jinping (16 October 2022). \"Hold High the Great Banner of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics and Strive in Unity to Build a Modern Socialist Country in All Respects\". *Qiushi*.

Bo was expected to join the PSC at the 18th Party Congress, with most expecting that he would try to eventually maneuver himself into replacing Xi.[41] Bo's policies in Chongqing inspired imitations throughout China and received praise from Xi himself during Xi's visit to Chongqing in 2010. Records of praises from Xi were later erased after he became paramount leader. Bo's downfall would come with the Wang Lijun incident, which opened the door for Xi to come to power without challengers.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPolicies and theories\n* Belt and Road Initiative\n* Chinese Dream\n* Common prosperity\n* Four Confidences\n* Four Comprehensives\n* Comprehensively Deepening Reforms\n* Chinese-style modernization\n* Foreign policy\n* Eight Musts\n* Eight-point Regulation\n* New productive forces\n* Targeted Poverty Alleviation\n* Two Establishes and Two Upholds\n* Xi Jinping Thought\n\t+ Culture\n\t+ Diplomacy\n* Holistic security concept\n* Personality cult\n* Party media takes the party's last name\n* Three Stricts and Three Honests\n* Two Centenaries\n* Wolf warrior diplomacy\n* Whole-process people's democracy\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nKey events\n* Anti-corruption campaign\n* 709 crackdown\n* Persecution of Uyghurs in China\n\t+ Xinjiang internment camps\n* China–US trade war\n* 2019–20 Hong Kong protests\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n\t+ Response\n* CCP centenary\n* Historical resolution\n* 2020–2021 reform spree\n* 2022 Hong Kong visit\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n453. **^** Düben, Björn Alexander (3 March 2020). \"Xi Jinping and the End of Chinese Exceptionalism\". *Problems of Post-Communism*. **67** (2): 111–128. doi:10.1080/10758216.2018.1535274.

He has centralised his power and created working groups with himself at the head to subvert government bureaucracy, making himself become the unmistakable central figure of the new administration.[108] Beginning in 2013, the CCP under Xi has created a series of Central Leading Groups: supra-ministerial steering committees, designed to bypass existing institutions when making decisions, and ostensibly make policy-making a more efficient process. The most notable new body is the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms. It has broad jurisdiction over economic restructuring and social reforms, and is said to have displaced some of the power previously held by the State Council and its premier.[109]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n430. **^** Buckley, Chris (12 October 2014). \"Leader Taps into Chinese Classics in Seeking to Cement Power\". *The New York Times*.

Since then, the phrase has become the signature political slogan of the Xi era.[424][425] The origin of the term \"Chinese Dream\" is unclear. While the phrase has been used before by journalists and scholars,[426] some publications have posited the term likely drew its inspiration from the concept of the American Dream.[427] *The Economist* noted the abstract and seemingly accessible nature of the concept with no specific overarching policy stipulations may be a deliberate departure from the jargon-heavy ideologies of his predecessors.[428] Xi has linked the \"Chinese Dream\" with the phrase \"great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\".[429][e]\n\n\n\n### Cultural revival[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Vogel, Ezra (2021). \"The Leadership of Xi Jinping: A Dengist Perspective\". *Journal of Contemporary China*. **30** (131): 693–696. doi:10.1080/10670564.2021.1884955.\n* Zhang, Feng (2019). \"The Xi Jinping Doctrine of China's International Relations\". *Asia Policy*. **14** (3).\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n**Xi Jinping** at Wikipedia's sister projects\n\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)News from Wikinews\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n* ![](image)Data from Wikidata\n\nLibrary resources about   \n **Xi Jinping** \n\n---\n\n* Resources in your library\n* Resources in other libraries\n\n* Biography at Chinavitae.com\n* Appearances on C-SPAN\n* Xi Jinping collected news and commentary at the China Digital Times\n* Xi Jinping collected news and commentary at *The Guardian* ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Xi Jinping collected news and commentary at *The New York Times*\n* Xi Jinping 2012 profile on BBC Radio Four\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nXi and Peng have a daughter named Xi Mingze, who graduated from Harvard University in the spring of 2015.

These were essentially cross-jurisdictional squads of officials whose main task was to gain more in-depth understanding of the operations of provincial and local party organizations, and in the process, also enforce party discipline mandated by Beijing.

The article also said that he sometimes authorizes investigations on close associates of a high-ranking politician to replace them with his own proteges and puts political rivals in less important positions to separate them from their political bases.

The plenum, while emphasizing the absolute leadership of the party, also called for a greater role of the constitution in the affairs of state and a strengthening of the role of the National People's Congress Standing Committee in interpreting the constitution.[215] It also called for more transparency in legal proceedings, more involvement of ordinary citizens in the legislative process, and an overall \"professionalization\" of the legal workforce. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn November 2013, at the conclusion of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee, the Communist Party delivered a far-reaching reform agenda that alluded to changes in both economic and social policy.

The Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms—another *ad hoc* policy coordination body led by Xi upgraded to a commission in 2018—was also formed to oversee the implementation of the reform agenda.[201] Termed \"comprehensive deepening reforms\" (全面深化改革; *quánmiàn shēnhuà gǎigé*), they were said to be the most significant since Deng Xiaoping's 1992 Southern Tour.

concept of internet sovereignty.[94][95] The censorship of Wikipedia has also been stringent; in April 2019, all versions of Wikipedia were blocked in China.[96] Likewise, the situation for users of

documents leaked to the press in November 2019 showed that Xi personally ordered a security crackdown in Xinjiang, saying that the party must show \"absolutely no mercy\" and that officials use all

extremism in his speeches, likening it to a \"virus\" or a \"drug\" that could be only addressed by \"a period of painful, interventionary treatment.\"[382] However, he also warned against the discrimination against Uyghurs and rejected proposals to eradicate Islam in China, calling that kind of viewpoint \"biased, even wrong\".[382] Xi's exact role in the building of internment camps has

also been other numerous cultural regulations, such as limiting video game usage by minors to 90 minutes during weekdays and 3 hours during weekends,[196] complete banning of cryptocurrency,[197] cracking down on idol worship, fandom and celebrity culture[198] and cracking down on \"sissy men\".[199] *The Wall Street Journal* has also reported in October 2021 that Xi had launched a round of

He was promoted in 1983 to secretary, becoming the top official of the county.[23] Xi subsequently served in four provinces during his regional political career: Hebei (1982–1985), Fujian (1985–2002), Zhejiang (2002–2007), and Shanghai (2007).[24] Xi held posts in the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1997, he was named an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the CCP. However, of the 151 alternate members of the Central Committee elected at the 15th Party Congress, Xi received the lowest number of votes in favour, placing him last in the rankings of members, ostensibly due to his status as a princeling.[b][25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n476. **^** Forsythe, Michael (17 June 2012). \"As China's Leader Fights Graft, His Relatives Shed Assets\". *The New York Times*.

He lived in a yaodong in the village of Liangjiahe, Shaanxi province, where he joined the CCP after several failed attempts and worked as the local party secretary. After studying chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student, Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of Fujian from 1999 to 2002, before becoming governor and party secretary of neighboring Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He subsequently joined the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) of the CCP the same year and served as first secretary of the Central Secretariat in October 2007. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPolitical leaders of Shanghai since 1949\n |\n| --- |\n| Party CommitteeSecretaries | * Rao Shushi\n* Chen Yi\n* Ke Qingshi\n* Chen Pixian\n* Zhang Chunqiao\n* Su Zhenhua\n* Peng Chong\n* Chen Guodong\n* Rui Xingwen\n* Jiang Zemin\n* Zhu Rongji\n* Wu Bangguo\n* Huang Ju\n* Chen Liangyu\n* Han Zheng (acting)\n* Xi Jinping\n* Yu Zhengsheng\n* Han Zheng\n* Li Qiang\n* Chen Jining\n |\n| CongressChairpersons | * Yan Youmin\n* Hu Lijiao\n* Ye Gongqi\n* Chen Tiedi\n* Gong Xueping\n* Liu Yungeng\n* Yin Yicui ♀\n* Jiang Zhuoqing\n* Dong Yunhu\n* Huang Lixin ♀\n |\n| Mayors | * Chen Yi\n* Ke Qingshi\n* Cao Diqiu\n* Zhang Chunqiao\n* Su Zhenhua\n* Peng Chong\n* Wang Daohan\n* Jiang Zemin\n* Zhu Rongji\n* Huang Ju\n* Xu Kuangdi\n* Chen Liangyu\n* Han Zheng\n* Yang Xiong\n* Ying Yong\n* Gong Zheng\n |\n| ConferenceChairpersons | * Ke Qingshi\n* Chen Pixian\n* Peng Chong\n* Wang Yiping\n* Li Guohao\n* Xie Xide ♀\n* Chen Tiedi ♀\n* Wang Liping\n* Jiang Yiren\n* Feng Guoqin\n* Wu Zhiming\n* Dong Yunhu\n* Hu Wenrong\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 8th Vice President of the People's Republic of China |\n| **In office**15 March 2008 – 14 March 2013 |\n| President | Hu Jintao |\n| Preceded by | Zeng Qinghong |\n| Succeeded by | Li Yuanchao |\n|  |\n| Personal details |\n| Born |  (1953-06-15) 15 June 1953 (age 70)Beijing, China |\n| Political party | CCP (since 1974) |\n| Spouses | * Ke Lingling\n\n​\n ​\n(m. 1979; div. 1982)​\n* Peng Liyuan\n ​\n(m. 1987)​\n |\n| Children | Xi Mingze |\n| Parents | * Xi Zhongxun (father)\n* Qi Xin (mother)\n |\n| Relatives | * Xi Yuanping (brother)\n* Qi Qiaoqiao (sister)\n* Deng Jiagui (brother-in-law)\n* Zhang Lanlan (sister-in-law)\n |\n| Residence | Zhongnanhai |\n| Alma mater | Tsinghua University |\n| Signature | ![](image) |\n| Website | www.gov.cn (in Chinese) |\n| Xi Jinping's voice\n\n\nRecorded 30 June 2021\n\n |\n|  |\n| Chinese name |\n| Simplified Chinese | 习近平 |\n| Traditional Chinese | 習近平 |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n67. **^** Chen, Zhuang (10 December 2012). \"The symbolism of Xi Jinping's trip south\". *BBC News*.

They divorced within a few years.[468] The two were said to fight \"almost every day\", and after the divorce Ke moved to England.[8] In 1987, Xi married the prominent Chinese folk singer Peng Liyuan.[469] Xi and Peng were introduced by friends as many Chinese couples were in the 1980s. Xi was reputedly academic during their courtship, inquiring about singing techniques.[470] Peng Liyuan, a household name in China, was better known to the public than Xi until his political elevation. The couple frequently lived apart due largely to their separate professional lives. Peng has played a much more visible role as China's \"first lady\" compared to her predecessors; for example, Peng hosted U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama on her high-profile visit to China in March 2014.[471]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Association for Conversation of Hong Kong Indigenous Languages Online Dictionary\". *hkilang.org*. 1 July 2015.

Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align two more powerful posts—general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC—which have no term limits. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n20th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (2022–2027)\n |\n| --- |\n| Standing Committee | 1.

Former prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, when asked about Xi, said he felt he was \"a thoughtful man who has gone through many trials and tribulations\".[43] Lee also commented: \"I would put him in the Nelson Mandela class of persons. A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgment. In other words, he is impressive\".[44] Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson described Xi as \"the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line\".[45] Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd said that Xi \"has sufficient reformist, party and military background to be very much his own man\".[46]\n\n\n\n### Trips as Vice President[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nXi was appointed to the nine-man PSC at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. He was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that he was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China's next leader. In addition, Xi also held the first secretary of the CCP's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress in March 2008, when Xi was elected as vice president of the PRC.[38] Following his elevation, Xi held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new president of the Central Party School of the CCP, its cadre-training and ideological education wing. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n105. **^** \"China elevates Xi to most powerful leader in decades\". *CBC News*. 24 October 2017.

Deng had two shell companies in the British Virgin Islands while Xi was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, but they were dormant by the time Xi became general secretary of the CCP in November 2012.[478]\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nXi is the first CCP general secretary born after the establishment of the PRC. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His anti-corruption campaign led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the PSC. He has also enacted or promoted a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to China's relations with the U.S., the nine-dash line in the South China Sea, the Sino-Indian border dispute, and the political status of Taiwan. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the Belt and Road Initiative. Xi has expanded support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), advanced military-civil fusion, overseen targeted poverty alleviation programs, and has attempted to reform the property sector. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| New Zhijiang Army | * Cai Qi\n* Chen Min'er\n* Huang Kunming\n* Lou Yangsheng\n* Bayanqolu\n* Ying Yong\n* Li Qiang\n* Ding Xuexiang\n* Zhong Shaojun\n |\n| Works | * *General Secretary Xi Jinping important speech series*\n* *The Governance of China*\n* *The Hopes of President Xi*\n* *Zhijiang Xinyu*\n* *Quotations from Chairman Xi Jinping*\n |\n| Family | * Xi Zhongxun (father)\n* Qi Xin (mother)\n* Ke Lingling (1st wife)\n* Peng Liyuan (2nd wife)\n* Qi Qiaoqiao (sister)\n* Xi Yuanping (brother)\n* Xi Mingze (daughter)\n |\n| Related | * *Amazing China*\n* Accelerator-in-Chief\n* Censorship of Winnie-the-Pooh\n* Cult of personality\n* Panama Papers (Deng Jiagui)\n* Open Letter asking Xi Jinping to Resign\n* *Rhyzodiastes xii*\n* *General Secretary Xi Jinping's Kindness We Never Forget*\n* *Xuexi Qiangguo*\n |\n| * **![](image) Category:Xi Jinping**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLater, his mother was forced to publicly denounce his father, as he was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. His father was later imprisoned in 1968 when Xi was aged 15. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement.[14] He worked as the party secretary of Liangjiahe, where he lived in a cave house.[15] According to people who knew him, this experience led him to feel affinity with the rural poor.[16] After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches, but he later returned to the village. He then spent a total of seven years there.[17][18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nXi was elected president on 14 March 2013, in a confirmation vote by the 12th National People's Congress in Beijing. He received 2,952 for, one vote against, and three abstentions.[60] He replaced Hu Jintao, who retired after serving two terms.[68] In his new capacity as president, on 16 March 2013 Xi expressed support for non-interference in China–Sri Lanka relations amid a United Nations Security Council vote to condemn that country over government abuses during the Sri Lankan Civil War.[69] On 17 March, Xi and his new ministers arranged a meeting with the chief executive of Hong Kong, CY Leung, confirming his support for Leung.[70] Within hours of his election, Xi discussed cyber security and North Korea with U.S. President Barack Obama over the phone. Obama announced the visits of treasury and state secretaries Jacob Lew and John F. Kerry to China the following week.[71]\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xi Jinping Administration\n\n### Anti-corruption campaign[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe pledged there would be no 'purges' during his administration, despite the fact many local officials were thought to have been implicated in the Chen Liangyu corruption scandal.[36] On most issues, Xi largely echoed the line of the central leadership.[37]\n\n\n\n## Rise to power[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOften described as an authoritarian leader by political and academic observers, Xi's tenure has included an increase of censorship and mass surveillance, deterioration in human rights, including the internment of one million Uyghurs in Xinjiang (which some observers have described as part of a genocide), a cult of personality developing around Xi, and the removal of term limits for the presidency in 2018. Xi's political ideas and principles, known as Xi Jinping Thought, have been incorporated into the party and national constitutions, and he has emphasized the importance of national security and the need for CCP leadership over the country. As the central figure of the fifth generation of leadership of the PRC, Xi has centralized institutional power by taking on multiple positions, including chairing the National Security Commission and new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2002, Xi left Fujian and took up leading political positions in neighbouring Zhejiang. He eventually took over as provincial Party Committee secretary after several months as acting governor, occupying a top provincial office for the first time in his career. In 2002, he was elected a full member of the 16th Central Committee, marking his ascension to the national stage. While in Zhejiang, Xi presided over reported growth rates averaging 14% per year.[30] His career in Zhejiang was marked by a tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials. This earned him a name in the national media and drew the attention of China's top leaders.[31] Between 2004 and 2007, Li Qiang acted as Xi's chief of staff through his position as secretary-general of the Zhejiang Party Committee, where they both developed close ties.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** \"Zhao Leji elected chairman of China's 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee\". *Xinhua News Agency*. 10 March 2023.

This was the third of its kind after ones adopted by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping,[126][127] and the document for the first time credited Xi as being the \"main innovator\" of Xi Jinping Thought[128] while also declaring Xi's leadership as being \"the key to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\".[129] In comparison with the other historical resolutions, Xi's one did not herald a major change in how the CCP evaluated its history.[130] To accompany the historical resolution, the CCP promoted the terms Two Establishes and Two Safeguards, calling the CCP to unite around and protect Xi's core status within the party.[131] In 2022, Xi appointed his close ally Wang Xiaohong as the Minister of Public Security, giving him further control over the security establishment.[132]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVolume one was published in September 2014, followed by volume two in November 2017.[465]\n\n\nAn app for teaching Xi Jinping Thought had become the most popular smartphone app in China in 2019, as the country's ruling CCP launched a new campaign that calls on its cadres to immerse themselves in the political doctrine every day. *Xuexi Qiangguo* is now the most downloaded item on Apple's domestic App Store, surpassing in demand social media apps such as WeChat and TikTok.[466] In 2021, the government included Xi Jinping Thought in the curriculum including to students from primary schools to university, which created pushback from parents. For much of the preceding 30 years, political ideology and communist doctrine were not a standard taught in Chinese schools until middle school, and textbooks featured a wider set of Chinese leaders with less emphasis on a single leader like Xi.[467]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the dismissal of Shanghai Party secretary Chen Liangyu in September 2006 due to a social security fund scandal, Xi was transferred to Shanghai in March 2007, where he was the party secretary there for seven months.[33][34] In Shanghai, Xi avoided controversy and was known for strictly observing party discipline. For example, Shanghai administrators attempted to earn favour with him by arranging a special train to shuttle him between Shanghai and Hangzhou for him to complete handing off his work to his successor as Zhejiang party secretary Zhao Hongzhu. However, Xi reportedly refused to take the train, citing a loosely enforced party regulation that stipulated that special trains can only be reserved for \"national leaders\".[35] While in Shanghai, he worked on preserving unity of the local party organisation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n516. **^** Dailey, Kate (15 February 2012). \"The early adventures of Xi Jinping\".

In Fujian, Xi made efforts to attract investment from Taiwan and to strengthen the private sector of the provincial economy.[28] In February 2000, he and then-provincial party secretary Chen Mingyi were called before the top members of PSC – general secretary Jiang Zemin, premier Zhu Rongji, vice president Hu Jintao and Discipline Inspection secretary Wei Jianxing – to explain aspects of the Yuanhua scandal.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter seven rejections, Xi joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1971 on his eighth attempt after he befriended a local official.[8] He reunited with his father in 1972, because of a family reunion ordered by premier Zhou Enlai.[13] From 1973, he applied to join the CCP ten times and was finally accepted on his tenth attempt in 1974.[19][20][21] From 1975 to 1979, Xi studied chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student in Beijing. The engineering majors there spent about 15 percent of their time studying Marxism–Leninism–Maoism and 5 percent of their time doing farm work and \"learning from the People's Liberation Army\".[22]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| First term | * 2012 election as Party general secretary\n* Anti-corruption campaign\n\t+ Wang Qishan (2012–2017)\n* World Internet Conference\n* 709 crackdown\n* Toilet Revolution in China\n* 2015 China Victory Day Parade\n |\n| Second term | * 2017 reelection as Party general secretary\n* Persecution of Uyghurs in China\n\t+ Xinjiang internment camps\n* China–United States trade war\n* 2019–20 Hong Kong protests\n* 2019 China 70th National Day grand parade\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n\t+ Response\n* 100th Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party\n* 2020 Inner Mongolia protests\n* 2020-2021 Xi Jinping Administration reform spree\n* 2022 Winter Olympics\n* 2022 Hong Kong visit\n |\n| Third term | * 2022 2nd reelection as Party general secretary\n |\n\n |\n| Diplomacy | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe following day Xi led the new line-up of the PSC onto the stage in their first public appearance.[60] The PSC was reduced from nine to seven, with only Xi and Li Keqiang retaining their seats; the other five members were new.[61][62][63] In a marked departure from the common practice of Chinese leaders, Xi's first speech as general secretary was plainly worded and did not include any political slogans or mention his predecessors.[64] Xi mentioned the aspirations of the average person, remarking, \"Our people ... expect better education, more stable jobs, better income, more reliable social security, medical care of a higher standard, more comfortable living conditions, and a more beautiful environment.\" Xi also vowed to tackle corruption at the highest levels, alluding that it would threaten the CCP's survival; he was reticent about far-reaching economic reforms.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn December 2012, Xi visited Guangdong in his first trip outside Beijing since taking the Party leadership. The overarching theme of the trip was to call for further economic reform and a strengthened military. Xi visited the statue of Deng Xiaoping and his trip was described as following in the footsteps of Deng's own southern trip in 1992, which provided the impetus for further economic reforms in China after conservative party leaders stalled many of Deng's reforms in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. On his trip, Xi consistently alluded to his signature slogan, the \"Chinese Dream\". \"This dream can be said to be the dream of a strong nation. And for the military, it is a dream of a strong military\", Xi told sailors.[66] Xi's trip was significant in that he departed from the established convention of Chinese leaders' travel routines in multiple ways. Rather than dining out, Xi and his entourage ate regular hotel buffet. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping greeting U.S. president George W.

Bo was expected to join the PSC at the 18th Party Congress, with most expecting that he would try to eventually maneuver himself into replacing Xi.[41] Bo's policies in Chongqing inspired imitations throughout China and received praise from Xi himself during Xi's visit to Chongqing in 2010. Records of praises from Xi were later erased after he became paramount leader. Bo's downfall would come with the Wang Lijun incident, which opened the door for Xi to come to power without challengers.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPolicies and theories\n* Belt and Road Initiative\n* Chinese Dream\n* Common prosperity\n* Four Confidences\n* Four Comprehensives\n* Comprehensively Deepening Reforms\n* Chinese-style modernization\n* Foreign policy\n* Eight Musts\n* Eight-point Regulation\n* New productive forces\n* Targeted Poverty Alleviation\n* Two Establishes and Two Upholds\n* Xi Jinping Thought\n\t+ Culture\n\t+ Diplomacy\n* Holistic security concept\n* Personality cult\n* Party media takes the party's last name\n* Three Stricts and Three Honests\n* Two Centenaries\n* Wolf warrior diplomacy\n* Whole-process people's democracy\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nKey events\n* Anti-corruption campaign\n* 709 crackdown\n* Persecution of Uyghurs in China\n\t+ Xinjiang internment camps\n* China–US trade war\n* 2019–20 Hong Kong protests\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n\t+ Response\n* CCP centenary\n* Historical resolution\n* 2020–2021 reform spree\n* 2022 Hong Kong visit\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n453. **^** Düben, Björn Alexander (3 March 2020). \"Xi Jinping and the End of Chinese Exceptionalism\". *Problems of Post-Communism*. **67** (2): 111–128. doi:10.1080/10758216.2018.1535274.

He has centralised his power and created working groups with himself at the head to subvert government bureaucracy, making himself become the unmistakable central figure of the new administration.[108] Beginning in 2013, the CCP under Xi has created a series of Central Leading Groups: supra-ministerial steering committees, designed to bypass existing institutions when making decisions, and ostensibly make policy-making a more efficient process. The most notable new body is the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms. It has broad jurisdiction over economic restructuring and social reforms, and is said to have displaced some of the power previously held by the State Council and its premier.[109]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n430. **^** Buckley, Chris (12 October 2014). \"Leader Taps into Chinese Classics in Seeking to Cement Power\". *The New York Times*.

Xi has repeatedly warned that the depoliticization of the PLA from the CCP would lead to a collapse similar to that of the Soviet Union.[220] Xi held the New Gutian Conference in 2014, gathering China's top military officers, re-emphasizing the principle of \"the party has absolute control over the army\" first established by Mao at the 1929 Gutian Conference.[221]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n159. **^** Wong 2023, p. 146. sfn error: multiple targets (2×): CITEREFWong2023 (help)\n160. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Orlik, Tom; Hancock, Tom (3 March 2023). \"What Wall Street Gets Wrong About Xi Jinping's New Money Men\". *Bloomberg News*.

The plenum, while emphasizing the absolute leadership of the party, also called for a greater role of the constitution in the affairs of state and a strengthening of the role of the National People's Congress Standing Committee in interpreting the constitution.[215] It also called for more transparency in legal proceedings, more involvement of ordinary citizens in the legislative process, and an overall \"professionalization\" of the legal workforce. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn November 2013, at the conclusion of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee, the Communist Party delivered a far-reaching reform agenda that alluded to changes in both economic and social policy.

The Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms—another *ad hoc* policy coordination body led by Xi upgraded to a commission in 2018—was also formed to oversee the implementation of the reform agenda.[201] Termed \"comprehensive deepening reforms\" (全面深化改革; *quánmiàn shēnhuà gǎigé*), they were said to be the most significant since Deng Xiaoping's 1992 Southern Tour.

concept of internet sovereignty.[94][95] The censorship of Wikipedia has also been stringent; in April 2019, all versions of Wikipedia were blocked in China.[96] Likewise, the situation for users of Weibo has been described as a change from fearing that individual posts would be deleted, or at worst one's account, to fear of arrest.[97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInternal Chinese government documents leaked to the press in November 2019 showed that Xi personally ordered a security crackdown in Xinjiang, saying that the party must show \"absolutely no mercy\" and that officials use all

extremism in his speeches, likening it to a \"virus\" or a \"drug\" that could be only addressed by \"a period of painful, interventionary treatment.\"[382] However, he also warned against the discrimination against Uyghurs and rejected proposals to eradicate Islam in China, calling that kind of viewpoint \"biased, even wrong\".[382] Xi's exact role in the building of internment camps has

also been other numerous cultural regulations, such as limiting video game usage by minors to 90 minutes during weekdays and 3 hours during weekends,[196] complete banning of cryptocurrency,[197] cracking down on idol worship, fandom and celebrity culture[198] and cracking down on \"sissy men\".[199] *The Wall Street Journal* has also reported in October 2021 that Xi had launched a round of inspections of the country's financial institutions, including state-owned banks, investment funds and financial regulators, on whether their ties to private firms had become too close, with the

served as the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 2002 to 2012, the president of China from 2003 to 2013, and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) from 2004 to 2012. He was a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, China's *de facto* top decision-making body, from 1992 to 2012. Hu was the fifth paramount leader of China from 2002 to 2012.[b]\n\n\nHu rose to power through the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), notably as Party Committee secretary for Guizhou province and the Tibet Autonomous Region, where his harsh repression of dissent gained him attention from the highest levels. He moved up to first secretary of the CCP Central Secretariat and vice president under CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin. Hu was the first leader of the Communist Party from a generation younger than those who participated in the civil war and the founding of the republic. Influential sponsors from the older generation promoted his rapid rise, including Song Ping, Hu Yaobang, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin.[1]\n\n\nDuring his term in office, Hu reintroduced state control in some sectors of the economy that were relaxed by the previous administration, and was conservative with political reforms. Along with his colleague Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, Hu presided over nearly a decade of consistent economic growth and development that cemented China as a major world power. He sought to improve socio-economic equality domestically through the Scientific Outlook on Development, which aimed to build a \"Harmonious Socialist Society\" that was prosperous and free of social conflict. Under his leadership, the authorities also cracked down on social disturbances, ethnic minority protests, and dissident figures, which also led to many controversial events such as the unrest in Tibet and the passing of the Anti-Secession Law. In foreign policy, Hu advocated for \"China's peaceful development\", pursuing soft power in international relations and a corporate approach to diplomacy. Throughout Hu's tenure, China's influence in Africa, Latin America, and other developing regions increased.\n\n\nHu possessed a modest and reserved leadership style. His tenure was characterized by collective leadership and consensus-based rule.[2] These traits made Hu a rather enigmatic figure in the public eye. His administration was known for its focus more on technocratic competence than persona.[3] At the end of his tenure after ten years in office, Hu won praise for retiring voluntarily from all positions. He was succeeded by Xi Jinping. Following the death of his predecessor Jiang Zemin, Hu is the only living former paramount leader of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hu's birthplace, Jiangyan, Jiangsu.\n\nHu Jintao was born on 21 December 1942[4] in Tai County, Jiangsu province, which was under Japanese occupation at the time. He is a direct descendant of the Ming dynasty general Hu Zongxian, known for fighting Japanese pirates.[5] His branch of the family migrated from Jixi County, Anhui to Taizhou during his grandfather's generation. Though his father owned a small tea trading business in Taizhou, the family was relatively poor. His mother was a teacher and died when he was 7, and he was raised by an aunt. Hu's father was denounced during the Cultural Revolution, an event that (together with his relatively humble origins) apparently had a deep effect upon Hu, who diligently tried to clear his father's name.[6]\n\n\nHe joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in April 1964. That year he graduated from Tsinghua University after studying hub hydropower stations at the Water Conservancy Engineering Department. He worked as a political counselor at Tsinghua.[7]: 107 In July 1965, Hu began work as an engineer.[8]\n\n\nIn 1968, during the Third Front construction,[9]: 179 Hu volunteered for his service in Gansu and worked on the construction of Liujiaxia Hydroelectric Station[10] while also managing CCP affairs for the local branch of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power. From 1969 to 1974, he worked for Sinohydro Engineering Bureau.[11]\n\n\nHu is married[*when?*] to Liu Yongqing, whom he met at Tsinghua University when they were studying there. They have two children together, Hu Haifeng and Hu Haiqing. Unlike Wen Jiabao, the premier, he never granted a public one-on-one interview with the media.[12][13]\nHe has been noted for his liking of table tennis and ballroom dancing.[14][15]\nHu is also said to possess a photographic memory that became evident in his high school days.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1973, Hu was transferred to the Construction Department of Gansu as a secretary. The next year he was promoted to deputy senior party secretary. In 1980, Deng Xiaoping implemented the \"Four Transformations\" program, which aimed to produce communist leaders who were \"more revolutionary, younger, more knowledgeable, and more specialized.\" In response to this nationwide search for young party members, Song Ping, the first secretary of CCP Gansu Committee (Gansu's governor) discovered Hu Jintao and promoted him several ranks to the position of deputy head of the commission.[18] Another protégé of Song, Wen Jiabao, also became prominent at the same time.\n\n\nIn 1982, Hu was promoted to the position of Communist Youth League Gansu Branch secretary and was appointed as the director of the All-China Youth Federation.[19][1] His mentor, Song Ping, was transferred to Beijing as Minister of Organization of the Chinese Communist Party, and was in charge of senior cadres' recommendation, candidacy and promotion. With the support of Hu Yaobang (no relation) and Deng Xiaoping, Hu was assured of a bright future in the party. At Song Ping's suggestion, in 1982 central CCP authorities invited Hu to Beijing to study at the Central Party School.[20] Soon after, he was transferred to Beijing and appointed to a position in the secretariat of the Communist Youth League Central Committee (\"CY Central\"). Two years later Hu was promoted to first secretary of CY Central, thus its actual leader. During his term in the Youth League, Hu escorted Hu Yaobang, who was CCP general secretary then, in visits around the country. Hu Yaobang, himself a veteran coming from the Youth League, could reminiscence his youth through Hu's company.[21]\n\n\n\n### Leading the party in Guizhou[edit]\n\n\nIn 1985, Communist Party general secretary Hu Yaobang pushed for Hu Jintao to be transferred to Guizhou as the provincial Committee secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.[22] Hu attempted to improve the economy of the backwater province, and reputedly visited all of its eighty-six counties.[23] While in Guizhou, Hu was careful to follow Beijing's directives and had a reputation of being \"airtight\"; he rarely would offer his views on policy matters in public.[23] While Hu was generally seen as an official with integrity and honesty, some locals preferred his predecessor Zhu Houze. In 1987, Hu Jintao handled the local students protest parallel to the Democracy Wall carefully, whereas in Beijing similar protests resulted in Hu Yaobang's forced resignation.\n\n\n\n### Tenure in Tibet[edit]\n\n\nHu Yaobang was purged by Deng Xiaoping in 1987 due to his 'liberal' tendencies, and his departure from the political scene was initially seen as unfavourable towards Hu Jintao, who drew criticism from party elders for failing to criticize the ousted reformer.[24] In 1988, Hu Jintao was transferred to become Party Regional Committee secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region, while also taking on the role of Political Commissar of the local People's Liberation Army units. This made Hu effectively the number-one figure in the vast, restive region. A number of Tibetans have long been opposed to government policy in the region. Unrest and ethnic conflict were brewing, particularly anti-Han sentiments among segments of ethnic Tibetan society. Minor clashes had been occurring since 1987, and when the scale of unrest grew, Hu responded with the deployment of some 1,700 People's Armed Police into Lhasa in February 1989 in an attempt to warn against further disturbance.[25] Increased clashes culminated in serious rioting in Lhasa's core on 5 March 1989, five days before the 30th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising.[26] What occurred after is a matter of dispute. Rioters accused the police of shooting them arbitrarily, and the police claimed that they had acted in self-defense. In addition, there was speculation that Hu delayed his orders to clamp down on the protesters until late into the evening, when the police chief was forced to act because the situation was spiraling out of control. The protesters were suppressed early into the next day, and Hu asked Beijing to declare martial law on 8 March.[27]\n\n\nHu's role in the demonstrations and rioting on 5 March was never made clear. While it is general protocol that Hu must have at least implicitly approved the use of force against protesters, whether he actually gave orders throughout 5 March is a matter of debate.[c] In addition, John Tkacik cites that Hu had been coordinating with the Chengdu Military Region for troops to be on full alert as the situation progressed.[25] Some diplomatic analysts linked what they saw as Hu's brutal use of force to the suppression of activists and students in Tiananmen Square, which took place three months later. Whether Hu provided \"inspiration\" for the PLA on 4 June is a matter of debate, but it was clear that Hu's actions in Lhasa earned him unprecedented attention in the upper echelons of party power, including by \"paramount leader\" Deng Xiaoping.[1] When tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square, Hu was one of the first regional leaders to publicly declare his support for the central authorities.[25]\n\n\nHu experienced high-altitude sickness in June 1990, and returned to Beijing, but remained in his position for another two years, during which he achieved little. His departure to Beijing was seen, however, simply as a pretext to return to the center of Chinese politics, which led to some doubts as to whether or not he was as ill as he had claimed.[25] Martin Seiff of United Press International commented on Putin and Hu: \"Both are tough and able authoritarians who had extensive experience of repressing dissent on their rise to the top.\"[28]\n\n\n\n## Rise to power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hu Jintao during a defense meeting held at the Pentagon, May 2002\nBefore the opening of the 14th National Congress of the CCP in 1992, senior party leaders, including Deng and Chen Yun, were to select candidates for the CCP Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) to ensure a smooth transition of power from the so-called second-generation leaders (Deng, Chen, Li Xiannian, Wang Zhen, etc.) to third-generation leaders (Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi etc.). Deng also proposed considering another candidate for a further future transition, preferably someone under fifty to represent the next generation of leaders.[29] Song Ping, as the organization chief, recommended Hu as an ideal candidate for the prospect of a future leader. As a result, shortly before his 50th birthday, Hu Jintao became the youngest (aged 49 in October 1992) member of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, and one of the youngest PSC members since the Communist Party assumed power in 1949.\n\n\nIn 1992, Hu took charge of the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party as its first secretary, which oversaw day-to-day operations of the CCP Central Committee, and the Central Party School, which was convenient for him to bring up his own supporters among senior CCP cadres. Hu was also put in charge of the ideological work of the CCP. Although Hu was considered heir apparent to Jiang, he always took great care to ensure that Jiang be at the center of the spotlight. In late 1998, Hu promoted Jiang's unpopular movement of the \"Three Stresses\" – \"stress study, stress politics, and stress healthy trends\" – giving speeches to promote it. In 2001, he publicized Jiang's Three Represents theory, which Jiang hoped to place himself on the same level as other Marxist theoreticians.[30] In 1998, Hu became vice president, and Jiang wanted Hu to play a more active role in foreign affairs. Hu became China's leading voice during the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999.[31]\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hu–Wen Administration\n\n### Succeeded Jiang Zemin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hu Jintao speech as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and President of China\nOn 15 November 2002, after the 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, a new Hu Jintao-led Politburo nominally succeeded Jiang's, while Hu became the CCP general secretary, effectively making him the paramount leader. Additionally, Wen Jiabao became the premier. However, Jiang was re-elected to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, the top military body, despite Hu taking over as the general secretary.[32] Jiang resigned as CMC chairman in September 2004, his last official post. Following Jiang's stepping-down, Hu had officially taken on the three institutions in the People's Republic of China where power lie; the party, the state, as well as the military.\n\n\nDeng Xiaoping appointed three party General Secretaries, all designed to be successors, and was instrumental in the ousting of two of them, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. His third and final selection, Jiang Zemin, won Deng's continued, although ambiguous, backing and was the only general secretary in Communist Chinese history to voluntarily leave his post when his term ended.\n\n\nAlthough Jiang, then 76, stepped down as general secretary and from the Politburo Standing Committee to make way for a younger leadership, there was speculation that Jiang would retain significant influence because Hu was not associated with Jiang's influential Shanghai clique, to which six out of the nine members of the all-powerful Standing Committee were believed to be linked. However, later developments show that many of its members had shifted their positions. Zeng Qinghong, for example, moved from a disciple of Jiang to serving as an intermediary between the two factions.[33]\n\n\nHu and Premier Wen Jiabao inherited a China wrought with internal social, political and environmental problems. One of the biggest challenges Hu faced was the large wealth disparity between the Chinese rich and poor, for which discontent and anger mounted to a degree which wreaked havoc on the Communist Party's rule. Furthermore, the cronyism and corruption plaguing China's civil service, military, educational, judicial and medical systems threatened to destabilize the country bit by bit.\n\n\nHu was mostly conservative on political reforms during his tenure.[34] In the beginning of 2006, Hu launched the \"8 Honours and 8 Shames\" movement in a bid to promote a more selfless and moral outlook amongst the population.[1]\nAt the 17th CCP National Congress, Hu was re-elected as general secretary of the Central Committee and chairman of the CCP Central Military Commission on 22 October 2007. At the 11th National People's Congress, Hu was re-elected as president on 15 March 2008. He was also re-elected as chairman of the PRC Central Military Commission.[35]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy[edit]\n\n\n#### SARS crisis[edit]\n\n\nThe first crisis of Hu's leadership happened during the outbreak of SARS in 2003. Following strong criticism of China for initially covering up and responding slowly to the crisis, he dismissed several party and government officials, including the health minister, who supported Jiang, and the Mayor of Beijing, Meng Xuenong, widely perceived as Hu's protégé.[1]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hu talks with U.S. President Barack Obama at the 2009 Pittsburgh G-20 Summit\n![](image)Hu with George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush in Beijing, 10 August 2008\n#### Economic policies[edit]\n\n\nHu and Wen Jiabao took a more conservative approach towards reforms, and began to reverse some of Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 2005. Observers note that the government adopted more egalitarian and populist policies.[36] The administration increased subsidies and control over the health care sector,[37] increased funding for education, halted privatization,[38] and adopted a loose monetary policy, which led to the formation of a U.S.-style property bubble in which property prices tripled.[39]\n\n\nThe privileged state sector was the primary recipient of government investment, which, under the new administration, promoted the rise of large \"national champions\" which could compete with large foreign corporations.[38] During Hu's administration, the Chinese government increasingly funded the consolidation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), supplying massive subsidies and favoring SOEs in regulatory matters.[9]: 217 These efforts helped SOEs to crowd out foreign and domestic private sector competitors.[9]: 217 Nevertheless, the share of SOEs in the total number of companies have continued to fall, dropping to 5%, though their share of total output remained at 26%. Exchange rates for the yuan were also liberalized and the peg to the U.S. dollar was broken, leading the yuan to rise by 31% against the dollar from 2005 to 2012.[40] China's economic growth has averaged around 10% under Hu, while the economy surpassed the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan.[41][40]\n\n\nAfter taking over, Hu and Wen proposed to set up a Harmonious Society which aimed at lessening inequality and changing the style of the \"GDP first and Welfare Second\" policies.[42] They focused on sectors of the Chinese population that had been left behind by the economic reform, and took a number of high-profile trips to the poorer areas of China with the stated goal of understanding these areas better. Hu and Wen Jiabao also attempted to move China away from a policy of favouring economic growth at all costs and toward a more balanced view of growth that includes factors in social inequality and environmental damage, including the use of the green gross domestic product in personnel decisions. Jiang's clique, however, maintained control in most developing areas; as a result, Hu and Wen's macroeconomic regulation measures faced great resistance.[1]\n\n\n\n#### Tibet[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Tibetan unrest\n\n#### Hong Kong[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Democratic development in Hong Kong\n\n![](image)Protests against Hu Jintao in Hong Kong, July 2012\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of international trips made by Hu Jintao\n\n![](image)Hu Jintao with Leaders of the BRICS countries, from left, Singh, Medvedev, Rousseff and Zuma in April 2011\n![](image)Hu Jintao, Vice President Joseph Biden and Hillary Rodham Clinton\n![](image)The Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh and the President of China, Hu Jintao during G-8 Summit, at Sapporo, Japan on July 08, 2008\n![](image)Protests against Hu Jintao during his US visit, 18 January 2011\nUnder Hu's leadership, China continued its style of developmental diplomacy which had been adopted under Deng Xiaoping and continued by Jiang Zemin.[43] China's international behavior continued to be generally pragmatic and predictable.[43] Hu pledged that China would seek peaceful development in a harmonious world to assure the international community that China's rise offered opportunities and benefits rather than conflicts.[44] The key attributes of a harmonious world view of foreign policy are building and accepting a world where countries diverge in their paths of national development and political systems, coexistence of diverse civilizations, and rejected unilateralism and hegemonic ambitions.[45]\n\n\nIn 2006, Hu articulated the four phases of China's foreign policy developmental objectives: (1) big powers were the key, (2) periphery countries the priority, (3) developing countries the foundation, and (4) multilateralism the stage.[44]\n\n\nIn 2009, Chinese leader Hu Jintao called for a bolstered arms control agenda at the United Nations General Assembly, joining United States President Barack Obama's earlier calls for a nuclear-free world.[46]\n\n\nThroughout Hu's tenure, China's influence in Africa, Latin America, and other developing regions increased.[47] He sought to develop China's relationship with Japan, which he visited in 2008.[48] He downgraded relations with Russia because of unfulfilled deals.[49]\n\n\nHu emphasized an international relations premise of \"shared responsibility\": China would contribute to global common good, but it must not adversely affect its core interests in doing so, and its commitments must be conditional to those of other nations.[50] In the analysis of academic Suisheng Zhao, under Hu's leadership, \"China remained a reluctant rising power and selectively took on global and regional obligations. Chinese foreign policy became omnidirectional, multilevel, and multidimensional.\"[44]\n\n\n\n#### Taiwan[edit]\n\n\nEarly in his leadership, Hu faced a pro-independence counterpart in then Republic of China (ROC) president Chen Shui-bian. Chen called for talks without any preconditions, repudiating the 1992 consensus. Chen Shui-bian and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had continued to express an ultimate goal of de jure Taiwanese independence, and made statements on the political status of Taiwan that the PRC considers provocative. Hu's initial response was a combination of \"soft\" and \"hard\" approaches. On the one hand, Hu expressed a flexibility to negotiate on many issues of concern to Taiwan. On the other hand, he continued to refuse talks without preconditions and remained committed to Chinese unification as an ultimate goal. While Hu gave some signs of being more flexible with regard to political relationships with Taiwan as in his May 17 Statement, where he offered to address the issue of \"international living space\" for Taiwan, Hu's government remained firm in its position that the PRC would not tolerate any attempt by the Taiwanese government to declare de jure independence from China.[51]\n\n\nAfter Chen's re-election in 2004, Hu's government changed tactics, conducting a no-contact policy with Taiwan due to Chen and the DPP's independence leanings and repudiation of the 1992 consensus. The government maintained its military build-up against Taiwan, and pursued a vigorous policy of isolating Taiwan diplomatically. In March 2005, the Anti-Secession Law was passed by the National People's Congress, formalizing \"non-peaceful means\" as an option of response to a declaration of independence in Taiwan.\n\n\nHu's government increased contacts with the Kuomintang (KMT), its former foe in the Chinese Civil War, and still a major party in Taiwan.[52]: 138 The increased contacts culminated in the 2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China, including a historic meeting between Hu and then-KMT chairman Lien Chan in April 2005. This was the first meeting between the leaders of the two parties since the conclusion of World War II.[53][54]\n\n\nOn 20 March 2008, the Kuomintang under Ma Ying-jeou won the presidency in Taiwan, and a majority in the Legislative Yuan. Thereafter Hu immediately turned to a more 'soft' diplomatic approach and opened the way to a thaw in relations between the two sides.[55] A series of historic meetings between the CCP and KMT have followed. On 12 April 2008, Hu Jintao met with Taiwan's vice president-elect Vincent Siew in the latter's role as chairman of the Cross-strait Common Market Foundation during the Boao Forum for Asia. On 28 May 2008, Hu met with KMT chairman Wu Po-hsiung, the first meeting between the heads of the CCP and the KMT as ruling parties. During this meeting, Hu and Wu agreed that both sides should re-commence official dialogue under the 1992 consensus – that \"both sides recognize there is only one China, but agree to differ on its definition.\" Wu committed the new government in Taiwan against Taiwanese independence; Hu committed his government to addressing the concerns of the Taiwanese people in regard to security, dignity, and \"international living space\", with a priority given to allowing Taiwan to participate in the World Health Organization.\n\n\nIn addition to the party-to-party dialogue, de facto governmental dialogue took place via the Straits Exchange Foundation and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits in June 2008 on the basis of the 1992 Consensus, with the first meeting held in Beijing. Both Hu and his new counterpart Ma Ying-jeou agreed that the 1992 Consensus is the basis for negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan strait. On 26 March 2008, Hu Jintao held a telephone talk with then US president George W. Bush, in which he became the first Chinese leader to officially recognize the 1992 Consensus.[56] After several months of negotiations, in December 2008, the two sides agreed on the resumption of the Three Links, i.e., a re-opening of mail, trade, and direct air links between the two sides. Relations continued to be cordial between the two sides during Hu's tenure, and trade increased immensely, culminating in the signing of the preferential trade agreement Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) in 2010.\n\n\n\n### Power transition of Xi Jinping[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party\n\nSee also: 12th National People's Congress\n\nOn 15 November 2012, immediately after the 18th CCP National Congress, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee, succeeding Hu.[57] On 14 March 2013, he was succeeded by Xi as president.[58]\n\n\n\n## After retirement[edit]\n\n\nSince his retirement, Hu has kept a low-profile, rarely making public appearances. In September 2013, Hu visited an ancestral family home in Huangshan, Anhui, though the trip was not covered by state media.[59] In April 2014, he made an appearance in Hunan, visiting Hunan University and other historical sites.[60] He attended the 19th CCP National Congress in October 2017.[61] He also attended the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in October 2019, and the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party in July 2021.[62]\n\n\n\n### 20th Communist Party Congress[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hu Jintao's removal from the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party\n\nAt the closing ceremony of the 20th CCP National Congress on 22 October, Hu Jintao, who had been sitting next to Xi, was pulled from his seat and escorted out of the hall by two men in suits and with name badges.[63][64][65] This incident occurred before the votes that day, and Hu was absent from the voting due to this incident.[66][67] Xinhua News Agency, China's official press agency, stated that Hu was not feeling well,[68] while foreign news speculated whether Hu was genuinely sick or whether this was a deliberate political signal by Xi.[69][70][71] The incident was not broadcast in China and both Hu's and Hu's son's names were blocked by Chinese censors.[72]\n\n\n\n### Jiang Zemin's funeral[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the death of his predecessor Jiang Zemin, Hu was appointed to serve on the funeral committee, ranked 36th on the list out of over 700 names.[73] Hu Jintao appeared in public alongside Xi Jinping on 5 December 2022, attending the farewell ceremony before Jiang's body was cremated in Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery.[74] He was accompanied by an aide.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nHu presided over a decade of consistent economic growth, led China through the storm of the global financial crisis relatively unscathed, and increased China's international stature immensely.[75] China's achievements under Hu included modernizing China's infrastructure, launching China's first crewed space probe, and sponsoring two successful international events: the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai Expo.[75] In addition, Hu's \"soft approach\" to Taiwan, coinciding with the election of a Kuomintang government in Taipei, improved the relationship between mainland China and Taiwan. Trade and contact between the two sides increased significantly during Hu's tenure. In addition, Hu and Premier Wen Jiabao's populist policies have resulted in the elimination of agricultural taxes for farmers, more flexible policies towards migrant workers living in cities, more balanced development between the coastal regions and the hinterlands, enforcing minimum wage in cities and the promotion of sustainable and affordable housing developments. The response to the SARS public health crisis and the massive expansion of health insurance coverage for middle- to low-income citizens earned Hu accolades domestically. Generally speaking, these policies have been well received by the Chinese public.[76]\n\n\nIn foreign policy, Hu's critics say that his government was overly aggressive in asserting its new power, overestimated its reach, and raised the ire and apprehension of various neighbours, including Southeast Asian countries, India, and Japan. Such policies are also said to be provocative towards the United States.[77] Domestic critics, including the country's elites, intellectuals, and particularly dissidents, point to various shortcomings of the Hu administration and his failure in implementing his signature \"Socialist Harmonious Society\" policy. They cite, for example, that China's internal security budget exceeded its military budget during Hu's tenure as protests and other 'mass incidents' continued to increase across the country.[78] China's Gini coefficient climbed to 0.47 by 2010, indicating a potentially unsustainable gap between the rich and the poor.[75] The Hu administration's inability to rein in the wealth gap and its renewed emphasis on the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the economy led some economists to believe that Hu missed a critical opportunity for reform and structural adjustment.[79] Hu's increased support for SOEs, including to merger and consolidate, is a trend that has continued during the administration of Xi Jinping.[9]: 217\n\n\nHu's tough-on-corruption policies saw mixed results. While there were some attempts to increase transparency in the expenditures of official organs and bureaucrats, deeply entrenched systemic issues that were contributing to the growth of corruption remained unresolved. In addition, the massive corruption scandal that ensnared the military shortly after Hu's departure from office showed that Hu was unable to tackle entrenched interests in the military. In his own departing speech at the 18th Party Congress, Hu emphasized the potentially devastating effects that unchecked corruption would have on the party and the country. Moreover, the Hu administration's insistence on censorship and the curtailing of freedom of speech drew extensive criticism from human rights organizations and Western governments,[75] while artists and writers inside the country chided increased restrictions on cultural expressions during Hu's term. Although in the early years of his tenure Hu attempted to pioneer a form of \"intraparty democracy\" that called for greater participation from lower-ranked members to determine policy and select the leadership, there was little evidence of meaningful changes to the party's governing structure and decision-making process.[78]\n\n\nConsensus-based decision-making became a hallmark of the Hu era. Hu was never a strongman, did not rule with an iron fist, and was often seen as first-among-equals with his Politburo Standing Committee colleagues. Some called China's political landscape during Hu's era one of \"nine dragons taming the water\" (九龙治水), that is, nine PSC members each ruling over their own fief. In addition, Hu not only faced a profusion of special interest groups and political factions within the party, his ability to implement a cohesive program was also constrained by the influence of former leader Jiang Zemin.[80] Consequently, there is debate on how much power Hu held personally to effect change. Nevertheless, within the context of the system he was placed in, Hu was credited for being an effective mediator and consensus-builder.[75] Hu also won praise for stepping down as military chief in favour of his successor Xi Jinping, and at the same time relinquishing his position as general secretary. This was seen as a message to the establishment and Jiang Zemin that elders should retire according to protocol and avoid meddling in the affairs of their successors.[81]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n### Scientific Outlook on Development[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Scientific Outlook on Development\n\nPolitical observers indicate that Hu distinguished himself from his predecessor in both domestic and foreign policy. Hu's political philosophy during his leadership is summarized by three slogans — a \"Harmonious Socialist Society\" domestically and \"Peaceful Development\" internationally, the former aided by the Scientific Development Concept, which seeks integrated sets of solutions to arrays of economic, environmental and social problems, and recognizes, in inner circles, a need for cautious and gradual political reforms.[42] The Scientific Outlook on Development was written into the CCP and State Constitutions in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The role of the Party has changed, as formulated by Deng Xiaoping and implemented by Jiang Zemin, from a revolutionary party to a ruling party. During his tenure he continued the Party's modernization, calling for both \"Advancement\" of the Party and its increasing transparency in governance.\n\n\nWhat emerges from these philosophies, in Hu's view, is a country with a systematic approach to national structure and development that combines dynamic economic growth, a free market energized by a vigorous \"nonpublic\" (i.e., private) sector, heavy-handed political and media control, personal but not political freedoms, concern for the welfare of all citizens, cultural enlightenment, and a synergistic approach to diverse social issues (the Scientific Development Perspective) that lead, in Hu's vision, to a \"Harmonious Socialist Society\". In the view of the Chinese government, these philosophies, which have created a new \"China Model\" of governance, serve as a legitimate alternative to the West's \"Democracy Model\", particularly for developing countries. In Hu's words, \"A Harmonious Socialist Society should feature democracy, the rule of law, equity, justice, sincerity, amity and vitality.\"[42] Such a society, he says, will give full scope to people's talent and creativity, enable all the people to share the social wealth brought by reform and development, and forge an ever-closer relationship between the people and government. Hu even emphasized the potential of religious communities to contribute to economic and social development under the banner of \"Building a Harmonious Socialist Society.\"[82]\n\n\nSome observers attribute the political origins of low-carbon development strategy to Hu's Scientific Outlook on Development, although some industrial support in this area had already begun before Hu's formulation of the Scientific Outlook on Development.[83]: 23\n\n\nWestern criticism of Hu, particularly regarding human rights, exposes his hypersensitivity to social stability but does not lay as much emphasis on his fresh commitment to address China's multi-faceted social problems.[42] Hu's pragmatic, non-ideological agenda had two core values—maintaining social stability to further economic development and sustaining Chinese culture to enrich national sovereignty. In domestic policy, he seems to want more openness to the public on governmental functions and meetings. Recently, China's news agency published many Politburo Standing Committee meeting details. He also cancelled many events that are traditionally practiced, such as the lavish send-off and welcoming-back ceremonies of Chinese leaders when visiting foreign lands. Furthermore, the Chinese leadership under Hu also focused on such problems as the gap between rich and poor and uneven development between the interior and coastal regions. Both party and state seem to have moved away from a definition of development that focuses solely on GDP growth and toward a definition which includes social equality and environment effects.[51]\n\n\nIn 2004, Hu gave an unprecedented showing and ordered all cadres from the five major power functions to stop the tradition of going to the Beidaihe seaside retreat for their annual summer meeting, which, before, was commonly seen as a gathering of ruling elites from both current and elder cadres to decide China's destiny, and also an unnecessary waste of public funds. The move was seen by the Chinese public as symbolic of Hu's attitude towards corruption.\n\n\nIn June 2007, Hu gave an important speech at the Central Party School that was indicative of his position of power and his guiding philosophies. In the speech Hu used a very populist tone to appeal to ordinary Chinese, making serious note of the recent challenges China was facing, especially with regards to income disparity. In addition, Hu noted the need for \"increased democracy\" in the country.[84]\n\n\n\n### Moral guidance[edit]\n\n\nIn response to the great number of social problems in China, in March 2006, Hu Jintao released the \"Eight Honors and Eight Shames\" as a set of moral codes to be followed by the Chinese people, and emphasized the need to spread the message to the youth.[85] Alternatively known as the \"Eight Honors and Disgraces\", it contained eight poetic lines which summarized what a good citizen should regard as an honor and what to regard as a shame. It has been widely regarded as one of Hu Jintao's ideological solutions to the perceived increasing lack of morality in China after Chinese economic reforms brought in a generation of Chinese predominantly concerned with earning money and power in an increasingly frail social fabric.[86]\n\n\nIt has become a norm for Chinese communist leaders to make their own contributions to Marxist–Leninist theory. Whether this is Hu's contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory is debatable, but its general reception with the Chinese public has been moderate. Its promotion, however, is visible almost everywhere: in classroom posters, banners on the street, and electronic display boards for the preparation of the 2008 Olympics, and Expo 2010 in Shanghai. The codes differ from the ideologies of his predecessors, namely, Jiang's Three Represents, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and Mao Zedong Thought in that the focus, for the first time, has been shifted to codifying moral standards as opposed to setting social or economic goals.[87]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n*Newsweek* named Hu the second most powerful person in the world in 2009, referring to him as \"the man behind the wheel of the world's most supercharged economy.\"[88] *Forbes* also named him the second most powerful person in the world later that year.[89] Hu was named the 2010 World's Most Powerful Person by *Forbes Magazine*.[90] Hu was listed four times (2008, 2007, 2005 and 2004) on the Time 100 annual list of most influential people. In 2010, Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit and non-governmental organization with the stated aim of safeguarding the right to freedom of information, included Hu among the list of press freedom predators.[91]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n* Colombia:\n\t+ ![](image) Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit (21 January 1997)[92]\n* Cuba:\n\t+ ![](image) Member of the Order of José Martí (23 November 2004)[93]\n* Jordan:\n\t+ ![](image) Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (14 January 2001)[94]\n* Madagascar:\n\t+ ![](image) Grand Cordon of the National Order of Madagascar (25 January 1999)[95]\n* Pakistan:\n\t+ ![](image) Recipient of the Nishan-e-Pakistan (24 November 2006)[96]\n* Peru:\n\t+ ![](image) Grand Cross of Order of the Sun of Peru (19 November 2008)[97]\n* Turkmenistan:\n\t+ ![](image) Member of the Order of Saparmurat Türkmenbaşy the Great (29 August 2008)[98]\n* Ukraine:\n\t+ ![](image) Member 1st Class of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise (31 August 2010)[99]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\n\n* History of the People's Republic of China (2002–present)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** /huː dʒɪnˈtaʊ/; Chinese: 胡锦涛; pinyin: *Hú Jǐntāo*; Mandarin pronunciation: [xǔ tɕìn.tʰáʊ]\n2. **^** \"Paramount leader\" is not a formal title; it is a reference occasionally used by media outlets and scholars to refer to the foremost political leader in China at a given time.

served as the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 2002 to 2012, the president of China from 2003 to 2013, and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) from 2004 to 2012. He was a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, China's *de facto* top decision-making body, from 1992 to 2012. Hu was the fifth paramount leader of China from 2002 to 2012.[b]\n\n\nHu rose to power through the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), notably as Party Committee secretary for Guizhou province and the Tibet Autonomous Region, where his harsh repression of dissent gained him attention from the highest levels. He moved up to first secretary of the CCP Central Secretariat and vice president under CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin. Hu was the first leader of the Communist Party from a generation younger than those who participated in the civil war and the founding of the republic. Influential sponsors from the older generation promoted his rapid rise, including Song Ping, Hu Yaobang, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin.[1]\n\n\nDuring his term in office, Hu reintroduced state control in some sectors of the economy that were relaxed by the previous administration, and was conservative with political reforms. Along with his colleague Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, Hu presided over nearly a decade of consistent economic growth and development that cemented China as a major world power. He sought to improve socio-economic equality domestically through the Scientific Outlook on Development, which aimed to build a \"Harmonious Socialist Society\" that was prosperous and free of social conflict. Under his leadership, the authorities also cracked down on social disturbances, ethnic minority protests, and dissident figures, which also led to many controversial events such as the unrest in Tibet and the passing of the Anti-Secession Law. In foreign policy, Hu advocated for \"China's peaceful development\", pursuing soft power in international relations and a corporate approach to diplomacy. Throughout Hu's tenure, China's influence in Africa, Latin America, and other developing regions increased.\n\n\nHu possessed a modest and reserved leadership style. His tenure was characterized by collective leadership and consensus-based rule.[2] These traits made Hu a rather enigmatic figure in the public eye. His administration was known for its focus more on technocratic competence than persona.[3] At the end of his tenure after ten years in office, Hu won praise for retiring voluntarily from all positions. He was succeeded by Xi Jinping. Following the death of his predecessor Jiang Zemin, Hu is the only living former paramount leader of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hu's birthplace, Jiangyan, Jiangsu.\n\nHu Jintao was born on 21 December 1942[4] in Tai County, Jiangsu province, which was under Japanese occupation at the time. He is a direct descendant of the Ming dynasty general Hu Zongxian, known for fighting Japanese pirates.[5] His branch of the family migrated from Jixi County, Anhui to Taizhou during his grandfather's generation. Though his father owned a small tea trading business in Taizhou, the family was relatively poor. His mother was a teacher and died when he was 7, and he was raised by an aunt. Hu's father was denounced during the Cultural Revolution, an event that (together with his relatively humble origins) apparently had a deep effect upon Hu, who diligently tried to clear his father's name.[6]\n\n\nHe joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in April 1964. That year he graduated from Tsinghua University after studying hub hydropower stations at the Water Conservancy Engineering Department. He worked as a political counselor at Tsinghua.[7]: 107 In July 1965, Hu began work as an engineer.[8]\n\n\nIn 1968, during the Third Front construction,[9]: 179 Hu volunteered for his service in Gansu and worked on the construction of Liujiaxia Hydroelectric Station[10] while also managing CCP affairs for the local branch of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power. From 1969 to 1974, he worked for Sinohydro Engineering Bureau.[11]\n\n\nHu is married[*when?*] to Liu Yongqing, whom he met at Tsinghua University when they were studying there. They have two children together, Hu Haifeng and Hu Haiqing. Unlike Wen Jiabao, the premier, he never granted a public one-on-one interview with the media.[12][13]\nHe has been noted for his liking of table tennis and ballroom dancing.[14][15]\nHu is also said to possess a photographic memory that became evident in his high school days.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1973, Hu was transferred to the Construction Department of Gansu as a secretary. The next year he was promoted to deputy senior party secretary. In 1980, Deng Xiaoping implemented the \"Four Transformations\" program, which aimed to produce communist leaders who were \"more revolutionary, younger, more knowledgeable, and more specialized.\" In response to this nationwide search for young party members, Song Ping, the first secretary of CCP Gansu Committee (Gansu's governor) discovered Hu Jintao and promoted him several ranks to the position of deputy head of the commission.[18] Another protégé of Song, Wen Jiabao, also became prominent at the same time.\n\n\nIn 1982, Hu was promoted to the position of Communist Youth League Gansu Branch secretary and was appointed as the director of the All-China Youth Federation.[19][1] His mentor, Song Ping, was transferred to Beijing as Minister of Organization of the Chinese Communist Party, and was in charge of senior cadres' recommendation, candidacy and promotion. With the support of Hu Yaobang (no relation) and Deng Xiaoping, Hu was assured of a bright future in the party. At Song Ping's suggestion, in 1982 central CCP authorities invited Hu to Beijing to study at the Central Party School.[20] Soon after, he was transferred to Beijing and appointed to a position in the secretariat of the Communist Youth League Central Committee (\"CY Central\"). Two years later Hu was promoted to first secretary of CY Central, thus its actual leader. During his term in the Youth League, Hu escorted Hu Yaobang, who was CCP general secretary then, in visits around the country. Hu Yaobang, himself a veteran coming from the Youth League, could reminiscence his youth through Hu's company.[21]\n\n\n\n### Leading the party in Guizhou[edit]\n\n\nIn 1985, Communist Party general secretary Hu Yaobang pushed for Hu Jintao to be transferred to Guizhou as the provincial Committee secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.[22] Hu attempted to improve the economy of the backwater province, and reputedly visited all of its eighty-six counties.[23] While in Guizhou, Hu was careful to follow Beijing's directives and had a reputation of being \"airtight\"; he rarely would offer his views on policy matters in public.[23] While Hu was generally seen as an official with integrity and honesty, some locals preferred his predecessor Zhu Houze. In 1987, Hu Jintao handled the local students protest parallel to the Democracy Wall carefully, whereas in Beijing similar protests resulted in Hu Yaobang's forced resignation.\n\n\n\n### Tenure in Tibet[edit]\n\n\nHu Yaobang was purged by Deng Xiaoping in 1987 due to his 'liberal' tendencies, and his departure from the political scene was initially seen as unfavourable towards Hu Jintao, who drew criticism from party elders for failing to criticize the ousted reformer.[24] In 1988, Hu Jintao was transferred to become Party Regional Committee secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region, while also taking on the role of Political Commissar of the local People's Liberation Army units. This made Hu effectively the number-one figure in the vast, restive region. A number of Tibetans have long been opposed to government policy in the region. Unrest and ethnic conflict were brewing, particularly anti-Han sentiments among segments of ethnic Tibetan society. Minor clashes had been occurring since 1987, and when the scale of unrest grew, Hu responded with the deployment of some 1,700 People's Armed Police into Lhasa in February 1989 in an attempt to warn against further disturbance.[25] Increased clashes culminated in serious rioting in Lhasa's core on 5 March 1989, five days before the 30th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising.[26] What occurred after is a matter of dispute. Rioters accused the police of shooting them arbitrarily, and the police claimed that they had acted in self-defense. In addition, there was speculation that Hu delayed his orders to clamp down on the protesters until late into the evening, when the police chief was forced to act because the situation was spiraling out of control. The protesters were suppressed early into the next day, and Hu asked Beijing to declare martial law on 8 March.[27]\n\n\nHu's role in the demonstrations and rioting on 5 March was never made clear. While it is general protocol that Hu must have at least implicitly approved the use of force against protesters, whether he actually gave orders throughout 5 March is a matter of debate.[c] In addition, John Tkacik cites that Hu had been coordinating with the Chengdu Military Region for troops to be on full alert as the situation progressed.[25] Some diplomatic analysts linked what they saw as Hu's brutal use of force to the suppression of activists and students in Tiananmen Square, which took place three months later. Whether Hu provided \"inspiration\" for the PLA on 4 June is a matter of debate, but it was clear that Hu's actions in Lhasa earned him unprecedented attention in the upper echelons of party power, including by \"paramount leader\" Deng Xiaoping.[1] When tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square, Hu was one of the first regional leaders to publicly declare his support for the central authorities.[25]\n\n\nHu experienced high-altitude sickness in June 1990, and returned to Beijing, but remained in his position for another two years, during which he achieved little. His departure to Beijing was seen, however, simply as a pretext to return to the center of Chinese politics, which led to some doubts as to whether or not he was as ill as he had claimed.[25] Martin Seiff of United Press International commented on Putin and Hu: \"Both are tough and able authoritarians who had extensive experience of repressing dissent on their rise to the top.\"[28]\n\n\n\n## Rise to power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hu Jintao during a defense meeting held at the Pentagon, May 2002\nBefore the opening of the 14th National Congress of the CCP in 1992, senior party leaders, including Deng and Chen Yun, were to select candidates for the CCP Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) to ensure a smooth transition of power from the so-called second-generation leaders (Deng, Chen, Li Xiannian, Wang Zhen, etc.) to third-generation leaders (Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi etc.). Deng also proposed considering another candidate for a further future transition, preferably someone under fifty to represent the next generation of leaders.[29] Song Ping, as the organization chief, recommended Hu as an ideal candidate for the prospect of a future leader. As a result, shortly before his 50th birthday, Hu Jintao became the youngest (aged 49 in October 1992) member of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, and one of the youngest PSC members since the Communist Party assumed power in 1949.\n\n\nIn 1992, Hu took charge of the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party as its first secretary, which oversaw day-to-day operations of the CCP Central Committee, and the Central Party School, which was convenient for him to bring up his own supporters among senior CCP cadres. Hu was also put in charge of the ideological work of the CCP. Although Hu was considered heir apparent to Jiang, he always took great care to ensure that Jiang be at the center of the spotlight. In late 1998, Hu promoted Jiang's unpopular movement of the \"Three Stresses\" – \"stress study, stress politics, and stress healthy trends\" – giving speeches to promote it. In 2001, he publicized Jiang's Three Represents theory, which Jiang hoped to place himself on the same level as other Marxist theoreticians.[30] In 1998, Hu became vice president, and Jiang wanted Hu to play a more active role in foreign affairs. Hu became China's leading voice during the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999.[31]\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hu–Wen Administration\n\n### Succeeded Jiang Zemin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hu Jintao speech as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and President of China\nOn 15 November 2002, after the 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, a new Hu Jintao-led Politburo nominally succeeded Jiang's, while Hu became the CCP general secretary, effectively making him the paramount leader. Additionally, Wen Jiabao became the premier. However, Jiang was re-elected to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, the top military body, despite Hu taking over as the general secretary.[32] Jiang resigned as CMC chairman in September 2004, his last official post. Following Jiang's stepping-down, Hu had officially taken on the three institutions in the People's Republic of China where power lie; the party, the state, as well as the military.\n\n\nDeng Xiaoping appointed three party General Secretaries, all designed to be successors, and was instrumental in the ousting of two of them, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. His third and final selection, Jiang Zemin, won Deng's continued, although ambiguous, backing and was the only general secretary in Communist Chinese history to voluntarily leave his post when his term ended.\n\n\nAlthough Jiang, then 76, stepped down as general secretary and from the Politburo Standing Committee to make way for a younger leadership, there was speculation that Jiang would retain significant influence because Hu was not associated with Jiang's influential Shanghai clique, to which six out of the nine members of the all-powerful Standing Committee were believed to be linked. However, later developments show that many of its members had shifted their positions. Zeng Qinghong, for example, moved from a disciple of Jiang to serving as an intermediary between the two factions.[33]\n\n\nHu and Premier Wen Jiabao inherited a China wrought with internal social, political and environmental problems. One of the biggest challenges Hu faced was the large wealth disparity between the Chinese rich and poor, for which discontent and anger mounted to a degree which wreaked havoc on the Communist Party's rule. Furthermore, the cronyism and corruption plaguing China's civil service, military, educational, judicial and medical systems threatened to destabilize the country bit by bit.\n\n\nHu was mostly conservative on political reforms during his tenure.[34] In the beginning of 2006, Hu launched the \"8 Honours and 8 Shames\" movement in a bid to promote a more selfless and moral outlook amongst the population.[1]\nAt the 17th CCP National Congress, Hu was re-elected as general secretary of the Central Committee and chairman of the CCP Central Military Commission on 22 October 2007. At the 11th National People's Congress, Hu was re-elected as president on 15 March 2008. He was also re-elected as chairman of the PRC Central Military Commission.[35]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy[edit]\n\n\n#### SARS crisis[edit]\n\n\nThe first crisis of Hu's leadership happened during the outbreak of SARS in 2003. Following strong criticism of China for initially covering up and responding slowly to the crisis, he dismissed several party and government officials, including the health minister, who supported Jiang, and the Mayor of Beijing, Meng Xuenong, widely perceived as Hu's protégé.[1]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hu talks with U.S. President Barack Obama at the 2009 Pittsburgh G-20 Summit\n![](image)Hu with George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush in Beijing, 10 August 2008\n#### Economic policies[edit]\n\n\nHu and Wen Jiabao took a more conservative approach towards reforms, and began to reverse some of Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 2005. Observers note that the government adopted more egalitarian and populist policies.[36] The administration increased subsidies and control over the health care sector,[37] increased funding for education, halted privatization,[38] and adopted a loose monetary policy, which led to the formation of a U.S.-style property bubble in which property prices tripled.[39]\n\n\nThe privileged state sector was the primary recipient of government investment, which, under the new administration, promoted the rise of large \"national champions\" which could compete with large foreign corporations.[38] During Hu's administration, the Chinese government increasingly funded the consolidation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), supplying massive subsidies and favoring SOEs in regulatory matters.[9]: 217 These efforts helped SOEs to crowd out foreign and domestic private sector competitors.[9]: 217 Nevertheless, the share of SOEs in the total number of companies have continued to fall, dropping to 5%, though their share of total output remained at 26%. Exchange rates for the yuan were also liberalized and the peg to the U.S. dollar was broken, leading the yuan to rise by 31% against the dollar from 2005 to 2012.[40] China's economic growth has averaged around 10% under Hu, while the economy surpassed the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan.[41][40]\n\n\nAfter taking over, Hu and Wen proposed to set up a Harmonious Society which aimed at lessening inequality and changing the style of the \"GDP first and Welfare Second\" policies.[42] They focused on sectors of the Chinese population that had been left behind by the economic reform, and took a number of high-profile trips to the poorer areas of China with the stated goal of understanding these areas better. Hu and Wen Jiabao also attempted to move China away from a policy of favouring economic growth at all costs and toward a more balanced view of growth that includes factors in social inequality and environmental damage, including the use of the green gross domestic product in personnel decisions. Jiang's clique, however, maintained control in most developing areas; as a result, Hu and Wen's macroeconomic regulation measures faced great resistance.[1]\n\n\n\n#### Tibet[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Tibetan unrest\n\n#### Hong Kong[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Democratic development in Hong Kong\n\n![](image)Protests against Hu Jintao in Hong Kong, July 2012\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of international trips made by Hu Jintao\n\n![](image)Hu Jintao with Leaders of the BRICS countries, from left, Singh, Medvedev, Rousseff and Zuma in April 2011\n![](image)Hu Jintao, Vice President Joseph Biden and Hillary Rodham Clinton\n![](image)The Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh and the President of China, Hu Jintao during G-8 Summit, at Sapporo, Japan on July 08, 2008\n![](image)Protests against Hu Jintao during his US visit, 18 January 2011\nUnder Hu's leadership, China continued its style of developmental diplomacy which had been adopted under Deng Xiaoping and continued by Jiang Zemin.[43] China's international behavior continued to be generally pragmatic and predictable.[43] Hu pledged that China would seek peaceful development in a harmonious world to assure the international community that China's rise offered opportunities and benefits rather than conflicts.[44] The key attributes of a harmonious world view of foreign policy are building and accepting a world where countries diverge in their paths of national development and political systems, coexistence of diverse civilizations, and rejected unilateralism and hegemonic ambitions.[45]\n\n\nIn 2006, Hu articulated the four phases of China's foreign policy developmental objectives: (1) big powers were the key, (2) periphery countries the priority, (3) developing countries the foundation, and (4) multilateralism the stage.[44]\n\n\nIn 2009, Chinese leader Hu Jintao called for a bolstered arms control agenda at the United Nations General Assembly, joining United States President Barack Obama's earlier calls for a nuclear-free world.[46]\n\n\nThroughout Hu's tenure, China's influence in Africa, Latin America, and other developing regions increased.[47] He sought to develop China's relationship with Japan, which he visited in 2008.[48] He downgraded relations with Russia because of unfulfilled deals.[49]\n\n\nHu emphasized an international relations premise of \"shared responsibility\": China would contribute to global common good, but it must not adversely affect its core interests in doing so, and its commitments must be conditional to those of other nations.[50] In the analysis of academic Suisheng Zhao, under Hu's leadership, \"China remained a reluctant rising power and selectively took on global and regional obligations. Chinese foreign policy became omnidirectional, multilevel, and multidimensional.\"[44]\n\n\n\n#### Taiwan[edit]\n\n\nEarly in his leadership, Hu faced a pro-independence counterpart in then Republic of China (ROC) president Chen Shui-bian. Chen called for talks without any preconditions, repudiating the 1992 consensus. Chen Shui-bian and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had continued to express an ultimate goal of de jure Taiwanese independence, and made statements on the political status of Taiwan that the PRC considers provocative. Hu's initial response was a combination of \"soft\" and \"hard\" approaches. On the one hand, Hu expressed a flexibility to negotiate on many issues of concern to Taiwan. On the other hand, he continued to refuse talks without preconditions and remained committed to Chinese unification as an ultimate goal. While Hu gave some signs of being more flexible with regard to political relationships with Taiwan as in his May 17 Statement, where he offered to address the issue of \"international living space\" for Taiwan, Hu's government remained firm in its position that the PRC would not tolerate any attempt by the Taiwanese government to declare de jure independence from China.[51]\n\n\nAfter Chen's re-election in 2004, Hu's government changed tactics, conducting a no-contact policy with Taiwan due to Chen and the DPP's independence leanings and repudiation of the 1992 consensus. The government maintained its military build-up against Taiwan, and pursued a vigorous policy of isolating Taiwan diplomatically. In March 2005, the Anti-Secession Law was passed by the National People's Congress, formalizing \"non-peaceful means\" as an option of response to a declaration of independence in Taiwan.\n\n\nHu's government increased contacts with the Kuomintang (KMT), its former foe in the Chinese Civil War, and still a major party in Taiwan.[52]: 138 The increased contacts culminated in the 2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China, including a historic meeting between Hu and then-KMT chairman Lien Chan in April 2005. This was the first meeting between the leaders of the two parties since the conclusion of World War II.[53][54]\n\n\nOn 20 March 2008, the Kuomintang under Ma Ying-jeou won the presidency in Taiwan, and a majority in the Legislative Yuan. Thereafter Hu immediately turned to a more 'soft' diplomatic approach and opened the way to a thaw in relations between the two sides.[55] A series of historic meetings between the CCP and KMT have followed. On 12 April 2008, Hu Jintao met with Taiwan's vice president-elect Vincent Siew in the latter's role as chairman of the Cross-strait Common Market Foundation during the Boao Forum for Asia. On 28 May 2008, Hu met with KMT chairman Wu Po-hsiung, the first meeting between the heads of the CCP and the KMT as ruling parties. During this meeting, Hu and Wu agreed that both sides should re-commence official dialogue under the 1992 consensus – that \"both sides recognize there is only one China, but agree to differ on its definition.\" Wu committed the new government in Taiwan against Taiwanese independence; Hu committed his government to addressing the concerns of the Taiwanese people in regard to security, dignity, and \"international living space\", with a priority given to allowing Taiwan to participate in the World Health Organization.\n\n\nIn addition to the party-to-party dialogue, de facto governmental dialogue took place via the Straits Exchange Foundation and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits in June 2008 on the basis of the 1992 Consensus, with the first meeting held in Beijing. Both Hu and his new counterpart Ma Ying-jeou agreed that the 1992 Consensus is the basis for negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan strait. On 26 March 2008, Hu Jintao held a telephone talk with then US president George W. Bush, in which he became the first Chinese leader to officially recognize the 1992 Consensus.[56] After several months of negotiations, in December 2008, the two sides agreed on the resumption of the Three Links, i.e., a re-opening of mail, trade, and direct air links between the two sides. Relations continued to be cordial between the two sides during Hu's tenure, and trade increased immensely, culminating in the signing of the preferential trade agreement Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) in 2010.\n\n\n\n### Power transition of Xi Jinping[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party\n\nSee also: 12th National People's Congress\n\nOn 15 November 2012, immediately after the 18th CCP National Congress, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee, succeeding Hu.[57] On 14 March 2013, he was succeeded by Xi as president.[58]\n\n\n\n## After retirement[edit]\n\n\nSince his retirement, Hu has kept a low-profile, rarely making public appearances. In September 2013, Hu visited an ancestral family home in Huangshan, Anhui, though the trip was not covered by state media.[59] In April 2014, he made an appearance in Hunan, visiting Hunan University and other historical sites.[60] He attended the 19th CCP National Congress in October 2017.[61] He also attended the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in October 2019, and the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party in July 2021.[62]\n\n\n\n### 20th Communist Party Congress[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hu Jintao's removal from the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party\n\nAt the closing ceremony of the 20th CCP National Congress on 22 October, Hu Jintao, who had been sitting next to Xi, was pulled from his seat and escorted out of the hall by two men in suits and with name badges.[63][64][65] This incident occurred before the votes that day, and Hu was absent from the voting due to this incident.[66][67] Xinhua News Agency, China's official press agency, stated that Hu was not feeling well,[68] while foreign news speculated whether Hu was genuinely sick or whether this was a deliberate political signal by Xi.[69][70][71] The incident was not broadcast in China and both Hu's and Hu's son's names were blocked by Chinese censors.[72]\n\n\n\n### Jiang Zemin's funeral[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the death of his predecessor Jiang Zemin, Hu was appointed to serve on the funeral committee, ranked 36th on the list out of over 700 names.[73] Hu Jintao appeared in public alongside Xi Jinping on 5 December 2022, attending the farewell ceremony before Jiang's body was cremated in Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery.[74] He was accompanied by an aide.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nHu presided over a decade of consistent economic growth, led China through the storm of the global financial crisis relatively unscathed, and increased China's international stature immensely.[75] China's achievements under Hu included modernizing China's infrastructure, launching China's first crewed space probe, and sponsoring two successful international events: the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai Expo.[75] In addition, Hu's \"soft approach\" to Taiwan, coinciding with the election of a Kuomintang government in Taipei, improved the relationship between mainland China and Taiwan. Trade and contact between the two sides increased significantly during Hu's tenure. In addition, Hu and Premier Wen Jiabao's populist policies have resulted in the elimination of agricultural taxes for farmers, more flexible policies towards migrant workers living in cities, more balanced development between the coastal regions and the hinterlands, enforcing minimum wage in cities and the promotion of sustainable and affordable housing developments. The response to the SARS public health crisis and the massive expansion of health insurance coverage for middle- to low-income citizens earned Hu accolades domestically. Generally speaking, these policies have been well received by the Chinese public.[76]\n\n\nIn foreign policy, Hu's critics say that his government was overly aggressive in asserting its new power, overestimated its reach, and raised the ire and apprehension of various neighbours, including Southeast Asian countries, India, and Japan. Such policies are also said to be provocative towards the United States.[77] Domestic critics, including the country's elites, intellectuals, and particularly dissidents, point to various shortcomings of the Hu administration and his failure in implementing his signature \"Socialist Harmonious Society\" policy. They cite, for example, that China's internal security budget exceeded its military budget during Hu's tenure as protests and other 'mass incidents' continued to increase across the country.[78] China's Gini coefficient climbed to 0.47 by 2010, indicating a potentially unsustainable gap between the rich and the poor.[75] The Hu administration's inability to rein in the wealth gap and its renewed emphasis on the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the economy led some economists to believe that Hu missed a critical opportunity for reform and structural adjustment.[79] Hu's increased support for SOEs, including to merger and consolidate, is a trend that has continued during the administration of Xi Jinping.[9]: 217\n\n\nHu's tough-on-corruption policies saw mixed results. While there were some attempts to increase transparency in the expenditures of official organs and bureaucrats, deeply entrenched systemic issues that were contributing to the growth of corruption remained unresolved. In addition, the massive corruption scandal that ensnared the military shortly after Hu's departure from office showed that Hu was unable to tackle entrenched interests in the military. In his own departing speech at the 18th Party Congress, Hu emphasized the potentially devastating effects that unchecked corruption would have on the party and the country. Moreover, the Hu administration's insistence on censorship and the curtailing of freedom of speech drew extensive criticism from human rights organizations and Western governments,[75] while artists and writers inside the country chided increased restrictions on cultural expressions during Hu's term. Although in the early years of his tenure Hu attempted to pioneer a form of \"intraparty democracy\" that called for greater participation from lower-ranked members to determine policy and select the leadership, there was little evidence of meaningful changes to the party's governing structure and decision-making process.[78]\n\n\nConsensus-based decision-making became a hallmark of the Hu era. Hu was never a strongman, did not rule with an iron fist, and was often seen as first-among-equals with his Politburo Standing Committee colleagues. Some called China's political landscape during Hu's era one of \"nine dragons taming the water\" (九龙治水), that is, nine PSC members each ruling over their own fief. In addition, Hu not only faced a profusion of special interest groups and political factions within the party, his ability to implement a cohesive program was also constrained by the influence of former leader Jiang Zemin.[80] Consequently, there is debate on how much power Hu held personally to effect change. Nevertheless, within the context of the system he was placed in, Hu was credited for being an effective mediator and consensus-builder.[75] Hu also won praise for stepping down as military chief in favour of his successor Xi Jinping, and at the same time relinquishing his position as general secretary. This was seen as a message to the establishment and Jiang Zemin that elders should retire according to protocol and avoid meddling in the affairs of their successors.[81]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n### Scientific Outlook on Development[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Scientific Outlook on Development\n\nPolitical observers indicate that Hu distinguished himself from his predecessor in both domestic and foreign policy. Hu's political philosophy during his leadership is summarized by three slogans — a \"Harmonious Socialist Society\" domestically and \"Peaceful Development\" internationally, the former aided by the Scientific Development Concept, which seeks integrated sets of solutions to arrays of economic, environmental and social problems, and recognizes, in inner circles, a need for cautious and gradual political reforms.[42] The Scientific Outlook on Development was written into the CCP and State Constitutions in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The role of the Party has changed, as formulated by Deng Xiaoping and implemented by Jiang Zemin, from a revolutionary party to a ruling party. During his tenure he continued the Party's modernization, calling for both \"Advancement\" of the Party and its increasing transparency in governance.\n\n\nWhat emerges from these philosophies, in Hu's view, is a country with a systematic approach to national structure and development that combines dynamic economic growth, a free market energized by a vigorous \"nonpublic\" (i.e., private) sector, heavy-handed political and media control, personal but not political freedoms, concern for the welfare of all citizens, cultural enlightenment, and a synergistic approach to diverse social issues (the Scientific Development Perspective) that lead, in Hu's vision, to a \"Harmonious Socialist Society\". In the view of the Chinese government, these philosophies, which have created a new \"China Model\" of governance, serve as a legitimate alternative to the West's \"Democracy Model\", particularly for developing countries. In Hu's words, \"A Harmonious Socialist Society should feature democracy, the rule of law, equity, justice, sincerity, amity and vitality.\"[42] Such a society, he says, will give full scope to people's talent and creativity, enable all the people to share the social wealth brought by reform and development, and forge an ever-closer relationship between the people and government. Hu even emphasized the potential of religious communities to contribute to economic and social development under the banner of \"Building a Harmonious Socialist Society.\"[82]\n\n\nSome observers attribute the political origins of low-carbon development strategy to Hu's Scientific Outlook on Development, although some industrial support in this area had already begun before Hu's formulation of the Scientific Outlook on Development.[83]: 23\n\n\nWestern criticism of Hu, particularly regarding human rights, exposes his hypersensitivity to social stability but does not lay as much emphasis on his fresh commitment to address China's multi-faceted social problems.[42] Hu's pragmatic, non-ideological agenda had two core values—maintaining social stability to further economic development and sustaining Chinese culture to enrich national sovereignty. In domestic policy, he seems to want more openness to the public on governmental functions and meetings. Recently, China's news agency published many Politburo Standing Committee meeting details. He also cancelled many events that are traditionally practiced, such as the lavish send-off and welcoming-back ceremonies of Chinese leaders when visiting foreign lands. Furthermore, the Chinese leadership under Hu also focused on such problems as the gap between rich and poor and uneven development between the interior and coastal regions. Both party and state seem to have moved away from a definition of development that focuses solely on GDP growth and toward a definition which includes social equality and environment effects.[51]\n\n\nIn 2004, Hu gave an unprecedented showing and ordered all cadres from the five major power functions to stop the tradition of going to the Beidaihe seaside retreat for their annual summer meeting, which, before, was commonly seen as a gathering of ruling elites from both current and elder cadres to decide China's destiny, and also an unnecessary waste of public funds. The move was seen by the Chinese public as symbolic of Hu's attitude towards corruption.\n\n\nIn June 2007, Hu gave an important speech at the Central Party School that was indicative of his position of power and his guiding philosophies. In the speech Hu used a very populist tone to appeal to ordinary Chinese, making serious note of the recent challenges China was facing, especially with regards to income disparity. In addition, Hu noted the need for \"increased democracy\" in the country.[84]\n\n\n\n### Moral guidance[edit]\n\n\nIn response to the great number of social problems in China, in March 2006, Hu Jintao released the \"Eight Honors and Eight Shames\" as a set of moral codes to be followed by the Chinese people, and emphasized the need to spread the message to the youth.[85] Alternatively known as the \"Eight Honors and Disgraces\", it contained eight poetic lines which summarized what a good citizen should regard as an honor and what to regard as a shame. It has been widely regarded as one of Hu Jintao's ideological solutions to the perceived increasing lack of morality in China after Chinese economic reforms brought in a generation of Chinese predominantly concerned with earning money and power in an increasingly frail social fabric.[86]\n\n\nIt has become a norm for Chinese communist leaders to make their own contributions to Marxist–Leninist theory. Whether this is Hu's contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory is debatable, but its general reception with the Chinese public has been moderate. Its promotion, however, is visible almost everywhere: in classroom posters, banners on the street, and electronic display boards for the preparation of the 2008 Olympics, and Expo 2010 in Shanghai. The codes differ from the ideologies of his predecessors, namely, Jiang's Three Represents, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and Mao Zedong Thought in that the focus, for the first time, has been shifted to codifying moral standards as opposed to setting social or economic goals.[87]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n*Newsweek* named Hu the second most powerful person in the world in 2009, referring to him as \"the man behind the wheel of the world's most supercharged economy.\"[88] *Forbes* also named him the second most powerful person in the world later that year.[89] Hu was named the 2010 World's Most Powerful Person by *Forbes Magazine*.[90] Hu was listed four times (2008, 2007, 2005 and 2004) on the Time 100 annual list of most influential people. In 2010, Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit and non-governmental organization with the stated aim of safeguarding the right to freedom of information, included Hu among the list of press freedom predators.[91]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n* Colombia:\n\t+ ![](image) Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit (21 January 1997)[92]\n* Cuba:\n\t+ ![](image) Member of the Order of José Martí (23 November 2004)[93]\n* Jordan:\n\t+ ![](image) Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (14 January 2001)[94]\n* Madagascar:\n\t+ ![](image) Grand Cordon of the National Order of Madagascar (25 January 1999)[95]\n* Pakistan:\n\t+ ![](image) Recipient of the Nishan-e-Pakistan (24 November 2006)[96]\n* Peru:\n\t+ ![](image) Grand Cross of Order of the Sun of Peru (19 November 2008)[97]\n* Turkmenistan:\n\t+ ![](image) Member of the Order of Saparmurat Türkmenbaşy the Great (29 August 2008)[98]\n* Ukraine:\n\t+ ![](image) Member 1st Class of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise (31 August 2010)[99]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\n\n* History of the People's Republic of China (2002–present)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** /huː dʒɪnˈtaʊ/; Chinese: 胡锦涛; pinyin: *Hú Jǐntāo*; Mandarin pronunciation: [xǔ tɕìn.tʰáʊ]\n2. **^** \"Paramount leader\" is not a formal title; it is a reference occasionally used by media outlets and scholars to refer to the foremost political leader in China at a given time.

Jiang was the third paramount leader of China from 1989 to 2002. He was the core leader of the third generation of Chinese leadership, one of four core leaders alongside Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Xi Jinping.\n\n\nBorn in Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Jiang joined the CCP while he was in college. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he received training at the Stalin Automobile Works in Moscow in the 1950s, later returning to Shanghai in 1962 to serve in various institutes, later being sent between 1970 and 1972 to Romania as part of an expert team to establish machinery manufacturing plants in the country. After 1979, he was appointed as the vice chair of two commissions by vice premier Gu Mu to oversee the newly established special economic zones (SEZs). He became the vice minister of the newly established Ministry of Electronics Industry and a member of the CCP Central Committee in 1982.\n\n\nJiang was appointed as the mayor of Shanghai in 1985, later being promoted to its Communist Party secretary, as well as a member of the CCP Politburo, in 1987. Jiang came to power unexpectedly as a compromise candidate following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, when he replaced Zhao Ziyang as CCP general secretary after Zhao was ousted for his support for the student movement. As the involvement of the \"Eight Elders\" in Chinese politics steadily declined,[1] Jiang consolidated his hold on power to become the \"paramount leader\" in the country during the 1990s.[b] Urged by Deng Xiaoping's southern tour in 1992, Jiang officially introduced the term \"socialist market economy\" in his speech during the 14th CCP National Congress held later that year, which accelerated \"opening up and reform\".[2]\n\n\nUnder Jiang's leadership, China experienced substantial economic growth with the continuation of market reforms. The returning of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997 and of Macau from Portugal in 1999, and entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, were landmark moments of his era.[3] China also witnessed improved relations with the outside world, while the Communist Party maintained its tight control over the state. Jiang faced criticism over human rights abuses, including the crackdown on the Falun Gong movement. His contributions to party doctrine, known as the \"Three Represents\", were written into the CCP constitution in 2002. Jiang gradually vacated his official leadership titles from 2002 to 2005, being succeeded in these roles by Hu Jintao, although he and his political faction continued to influence affairs until much later. In 2022, Jiang died in Shanghai.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Graduation photo of Jiang, taken in 1947\nJiang Zemin was born in the city of Yangzhou, Jiangsu, on 17 August 1926.[4] His ancestral home was the Jiangcun Village (江村) in Jingde County, Anhui. This was also the hometown of a number of prominent figures in Chinese academic and intellectual establishments.[5] Jiang grew up during the years of Japanese occupation. His uncle and foster father, Jiang Shangqing, died fighting the Japanese and was considered in Jiang Zemin's time to be a national hero.[6]: 40 After Shangqing's death, Zemin became his male heir.[7]\n\n\nJiang attended the Department of Electrical Engineering at the National Central University in Japanese-occupied Nanjing before transferring to National Chiao Tung University (now Shanghai Jiao Tong University). He graduated there in 1947 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.[8] Jiang joined the Chinese Communist Party when he was in college.[9] After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Jiang received his training at the Stalin Automobile Works in Moscow in the 1950s.[10] He also worked for Changchun's First Automobile Works.[11] As Jiang became increasingly involved in the Communist Party, his main work shifted from the technical side of engineering to administrative and political tasks.[6]: 140\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jiang in 1962\nIn 1962, he returned to Shanghai and became the deputy director of the Shanghai Electric Research Institute. In 1966, he was appointed as the director and deputy party secretary of a thermal engineering research institute in Wuhan, which was established by the First Ministry of Machine Building. When the Cultural Revolution began in the same year, he did not suffer greatly during the turmoil, but was pulled down from his position as director of the institute and was sent to a May Seventh Cadre School. In 1970, after leaving the cadre school, he became the deputy director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the ministry and was sent to the Socialist Republic of Romania, where he served as head of the expert team to establish fifteen machinery manufacturing plants in the country. After the completion of his mission in 1972, he returned to China.[12][13][14]\n\n\nIn 1979, following a thawing of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, Deng Xiaoping decided to encourage special economic zones (SEZs) as part of his Four Modernizations.[15] China's State Council established two ministerial commissions to increase trade and foreign investment. The commissions were headed by vice premier Gu Mu, who appointed Jiang as vice chairman of both commissions, a position equivalent to vice minister.[16] Jiang's role was to ensure these SEZs increased economic prosperity without becoming \"conduits\" for foreign ideology.[16] In 1980, Jiang headed a delegation which toured other SEZs in twelve countries; upon his return, he issued a radical report which recommended allowing local authorities to issue tax breaks and land leases, and increasing the power of foreign joint ventures.[17] The report initially \"caused consternation\" among party leaders, but his pragmatic and empirical presentation appealed to Deng Xiaoping. His proposals were approved at the National People's Congress, cementing Jiang as an \"early implementer\" of Deng Xiaoping Theory.[18]\n\n\nIn March 1982, he was pushed out as vice chairman of two commissions. After pressure from premier Gu and Shanghai mayor Wang Daohan, \"ardent reformist\" Zhao Ziyang appointed Jiang as the first vice minister and party secretary of the newly established Ministry of Electronics Industry.[19]\n\n\nAt the 12th Party Congress held in September 1982, Jiang became a member of the Central Committee of the CCP, which determines policy and elects the members of the Politburo.[19]\n\n\n\n## Career in Shanghai[edit]\n\n\nIn 1985, Jiang became mayor of Shanghai. Jiang received mixed reviews as mayor. Many of his critics dismissed him as a \"flower pot\", a Chinese term for someone who only seems useful, but actually gets nothing done.[20] Many credited Shanghai's growth during the period to Zhu Rongji.[21] Jiang was an ardent believer, during this period, in Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms. In an attempt to curb student discontent in 1986, Jiang recited the Gettysburg Address in English in front of a group of student protesters.[22][23][24]\n\n\nAt the 13th National Congress of the CCP held in October 1987, Jiang was promoted from mayor to Shanghai party secretary, the most powerful position in the city, reporting directly to the central government.[25] He also joined the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with customs for party secretaries of major cities.[25]\n\n\n\n### Tiananmen Square protests[edit]\n\n\nIn April 1989, former general secretary Hu Yaobang died; he had previously been forced to resign in January 1987 and accused of supporting \"bourgeois liberalization\".[22] His death catalyzed the Tiananmen Square protests,[26] leading to an ideological crisis between \"liberals\" (who supported Deng's aggressive reforms) and \"conservatives\" (who favored slower change).[27] After the Shanghai-based *World Economic Herald* tried to publish a eulogy rehabilitating Hu and praising his reformist stance, Jiang took control of the newspaper's editorial board.[28][29] As the protests continued to grow, the Party imposed martial law and deploy troops in Beijing in May.[30] In Shanghai, 100,000 protestors marched in the streets, and 450 students went on a hunger strike.[31] After the third day, Jiang personally met with them to assure them that the Party shared their goals, and to promise future dialogue. He simultaneously sent a telegram to the Central Committee firmly supporting their martial law declaration.[30]\n\n\nHis careful public appeals were well received by both pro-democracy students and socialist party elders.[32] On 20 May 1989, paramount leader Deng Xiaoping decided to appoint Jiang as the new general secretary, replacing Zhao Ziyang,[32] who had supported the protestors.[33][34] Jiang was selected as a compromise candidate over Tianjin's Li Ruihuan, premier Li Peng, elders Li Xiannian, Chen Yun, and the retired elders to become the new general secretary.[35] Before that, he had been considered to be an unlikely candidate.[36]\n\n\n\n## Rise to power[edit]\n\n\nJiang was appointed as general secretary at the fourth plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee on 24 June 1989 with a fairly small power base inside the party, and thus, very little actual power.[37][9] His most reliable allies were the powerful party elders Chen Yun and Li Xiannian. He was believed to be simply a transitional figure until a more stable successor government to Deng could be put in place.[38] Other prominent Party and military figures like President Yang Shangkun and his brother Yang Baibing were believed to be planning a coup.[39]\n\n\nAt the first meeting of the new CCP Politburo Standing Committee, after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, Jiang criticized the previous period as \"hard on the economy, soft on politics\" and advocated increasing political thought work.[40] Anne-Marie Brady wrote that \"Jiang Zemin was a long time political cadre with a nose for ideological work and its importance. This meeting marked the beginning of a new era in propaganda and political thought work in China.\" Soon after, the Central Propaganda Department was given more resources and power, \"including the power to go in to the propaganda-related work units and cleanse the ranks of those who had been supportive of the democracy movement.\"[40]\n\n\nThe Politburo also issued a list of \"seven things\" regarding \"matters of universal concern to the masses\", with party corruption as the top priority.[41] Jiang was also appointed as the chairman of the Central Military Commission on 9 November 1989, succeeding Deng,[42] and president of the PRC on 27 March 1993;[43] this marked the start of the arrangement in which the paramount leader of China simultaneously serves as Party leader, president and chair of the CMC.[44]\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the People's Republic of China (1989–2002)\nIn the first few years, Jiang depended on the support of Deng Xiaoping to remain in power,[45] which forced Jiang into an \"ultranationalist stance\" towards Taiwan and the US.[46] Jiang had supported Deng's calls against \"bourgeois liberalization\", but while Jiang was seen as a \"thoughtful reformer\",[47] he \"[skewed] to the more conservative views of the elders and his Politburo colleagues\".[48] Deng was far more supportive of reforms, saying that \"deviating to the Left is an even greater danger\" than deviating to the right.[49]\n\n\nDeng grew critical of Jiang's leadership in 1992. During Deng's southern tour, he subtly suggested that the pace of reform was not fast enough.[50] Jiang grew ever more cautious, and rallied behind Deng's reforms completely. Jiang coined the new \"socialist market economy\" to move China's centrally-planned socialist economy into essentially a government-regulated market economy.[51] It was a huge step to take in the realization of Deng's \"Socialism with Chinese characteristics.\"[52] At the same time, Jiang elevated many of his supporters from Shanghai to high government positions, after regaining Deng's confidence. He abolished the outdated Central Advisory Commission in 1992, an advisory body composed of revolutionary party elders.\n\n\n\n### Economic development[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, post-Tiananmen economic reforms by Zhu Rongji with Jiang's support had stabilized and the country was on a consistent growth trajectory. At the same time, China faced myriad economic and social problems. At Deng's state funeral in 1997, Jiang delivered the elder statesman's eulogy. Jiang had inherited a China rampant with political corruption, and regional economies growing too rapidly for the stability of the entire country. Deng's policy that \"some areas can get rich before others\" led to an opening wealth gap between coastal regions and the interior provinces. The unprecedented economic growth and the deregulation in a number of heavy industries led to the closing of many state-owned enterprises (SOEs), breaking many people's iron rice bowl and initially removing as many as 40 million jobs from SOEs.[53][54] As a result, unemployment rates skyrocketed, rising as high as 40% in some urban areas. Stock markets fluctuated greatly. The scale of rural migration into urban areas was unprecedented anywhere, and little was being done to address an ever-increasing urban-rural wealth gap. Official reports put the figure on the percentage of China's GDP being moved and abused by corrupt officials at 10%.[55]\n\n\nJiang's biggest aim in the economy was stability, and he believed that a stable government with highly centralized power would be a prerequisite, choosing to postpone political reform, which in many facets of governance exacerbated the ongoing problems.[56] After the coastal regions and SEZs were sufficiently developed, Jiang worked to reduce geographic disparities by encouraging richer cities to \"provide financial, technological, and managerial assistance to the poorer, western ones.\"[57] The construction various infrastructure projects such as the Qinghai–Tibet railway and the Three Gorges Dam began under Jiang's leadership.[58]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jiang with US president Bill Clinton in 1999\n![](image)Jiang with President of Russia Vladimir Putin at APEC summit in Shanghai (2001)\nUnder Jiang's leadership, China continued its style of developmental diplomacy which had been adopted under Deng Xiaoping.[59] China's international behavior was generally both pragmatic and predictable.[59] During Jiang's presidency, serious flare-ups between China and the United States occurred.[60] Nonetheless, Jiang's foreign policy was for the most part passive and non-confrontational.\n\n\nIn July 1993, the United States Navy stopped a Chinese container ship, the *Yinhe*, based on the incorrect suspicion that it was carrying chemical weapon precursors bound for Iran.[61] Although China denied the allegation, the United States cut off the *Yinhe*'s GPS, causing it to lose direction and anchor on the high seas for twenty-four days until it acceded to an inspection.[61] There were no chemical precursors on the ship.[61] Although China sought a formal apology, the United States refused to apologize and refused to pay compensation.[61] Despite the humiliation of the *Yinhe* incident, Jiang took a stance of goodwill towards the United States and adopted the \"sixteen-characters formula\" for working with the United States: \"enhancing confidence, reducing troubles, expanding cooperation, and avoiding confrontation.\"[61]\n\n\nJiang oversaw a series of missile tests in the waters surrounding Taiwan in 1996 in protest to the Republic of China government under President Lee Teng-hui, who had been seen as moving its foreign policy away from the One-China policy.\n\n\nJiang went on a state visit to the United States in 1997, drawing various crowds in protest from the Tibet Independence Movement to supporters of the Chinese democracy movement. He made a speech at Harvard University, part of it in English, but could not escape questions on democracy and freedom. In the official summit meeting with president Bill Clinton, the tone was relaxed as they sought common ground while largely ignoring areas of disagreement. Clinton would visit China in June 1998, and vowed that China and the United States were partners in the world, and not adversaries.[62]\n\n\nAfter the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999, Jiang seemed to have put up a harsh stance for show at home, but in reality only performed symbolic gestures of protest, and no solid action.[56] Jiang deemed the United States-China bilateral relation too important to be harmed in the emotion of the moment and sought to soothe the Chinese public's outrage.[63]\n\n\nThe Hainan island incident was another tense event in the China-United States relations which occurred during Jiang's presidency.[64] On April 1, 2001, a United States US EP-3 surveillance aircraft collided mid-air with a Chinese Shenyang J-8 jet fighter over the South China Sea.[64] China sought a formal apology, and accepted United States Secretary of State Colin Powell's expression of \"very sorry\" as sufficient.[64] The incident nonetheless created negative feelings towards the United States by the Chinese public and increased public feelings of Chinese nationalism.[64]\n\n\nA personal friend of former Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien,[65] Jiang strengthened China's economic stature abroad, attempting to establish cordial relations with countries whose trade is largely confined to the American economic sphere.\n\n\n\n### Media depiction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jiang Zemin delivered a speech at the South Korean National Assembly in 1995\nThe *People's Daily* and CCTV-1's 7 pm *Xinwen Lianbo* each had Jiang-related events as the front-page or top stories, a fact that remained until Hu Jintao's media administrative changes in 2006. Jiang appeared casual in front of Western media, and gave an unprecedented interview with Mike Wallace of CBS in 2000 at Beidaihe. He would often use foreign languages in front of the camera; once, he gave a 40-minute speech entirely in Russian.[66] In an encounter with Hong Kong reporter Sharon Cheung in 2000 regarding the central government's apparent \"imperial order\" of supporting Tung Chee-hwa to seek a second term as Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Jiang scolded the Hong Kong journalists as \"too simple, sometimes naive\" in English.[67]\n\n\n\n### \"Three Represents\"[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Three Represents\n\nOn 25 February 2000, Jiang introduced the theory of Three Represents, which was later enshrined in both Party and State constitutions as an \"important thought\", following in the footsteps of Marxism–Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.[68][69] Officially termed as the latest development of socialism with Chinese characters under Jiang's tenure,[70] the Three Represents justified the incorporation of the new capitalist business class into the party, and changed the founding ideology of the CCP from protecting the interests of the peasantry and workers to that of the \"overwhelming majority of the people\", a euphemism aimed at placating the growing entrepreneurial class. Conservative critics within the party, such as hardline leftist Deng Liqun, denounced this as betrayal of \"true\" communist ideology.[68]\n\n\nBefore he transferred power to a younger generation of leaders, Jiang had his theory of Three Represents written into the Party's constitution, alongside Marxism–Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory at the 16th CCP Congress in 2002.[71]\n\n\n\n### Crackdown on Falun Gong[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Persecution of Falun Gong\n\nIn June 1999, Jiang established an extralegal department, the 610 Office, to crack down on Falun Gong. Cook and Lemish state this was because Jiang was worried that the popular new religious movement was \"quietly infiltrating the CCP and state apparatus.\"[72] On 20 July, security forces arrested thousands of Falun Gong organizers they identified as leaders.[73] The persecution that followed was characterized a nationwide campaign of propaganda, as well as the large-scale arbitrary imprisonment and coercive reeducation of Falun Gong organizers, sometimes resulting in death due to mistreatment in detention.[74][75][76]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Shanghai clique\n\n![](image)Jiang with his wife and George W. Bush with his wife in Crawford, Texas, 25 October 2002\nIn the run-up to the 16th National Congress of the CCP, Hu Jintao had \"almost unanimous support\" to become the new CCP general secretary.[77] To maintain China's image as a stable and respected country, Jiang and Hu emphasized their unity, striving to make this transition the first \"smooth and harmonious\" one in the PRC's history.[78][79] Jiang stepped down as general secretary and left the Politburo Standing Committee, but retained the chairmanship of the Central Military Commission,[80] which controlled the army and the nation's foreign policy.[81] Jiang would continue conselling Hu from \"behind the curtain\", and it was formally agreed that Jiang would be \"consulted on all matters of state importance\".[81] Both men also reached a \"tacit understanding\" that Hu would not be considered a \"core\" leader like Jiang, Deng and Mao.[82]\n\n\nAt the 16th Party Congress, the majority of new members for Standing Committee were considered part of Jiang's so-called \"Shanghai clique\", the most prominent being vice president Zeng Qinghong, who had served as Jiang's chief of staff for many years, and vice premier Huang Ju, a former party secretary of Shanghai.[83]\n\n\nAfter Hu succeeded Jiang as general secretary, the latter continued to \"[dominate] public life\" for several years.[84] The *South China Morning Post* announced that \"a new era has begun in China. But it is not that of Vice President Hu Jintao [...] Rather, it is a new era of President Jiang Zemin, who has just stepped down as the Party's general secretary.\"[80] Early in the 2003 SARS crisis, Jiang remained conspicuously silent, and observers were divided over whether it signified his waning influence, or respect for Hu.[85] It has been argued that the institutional arrangements created by the 16th Congress left Jiang in a position where he could not exercise much influence.[86]\n\n\nAlthough Jiang retained the chairmanship of the CMC, most members of the commission were professional military men. *People's Liberation Army Daily*, a publication thought to represent the views of the CMC majority, printed an article on 11 March 2003 which quotes two army delegates as saying, \"Having one center is called 'loyalty', while having two centers will result in 'problems.'\" This was interpreted as a criticism of Jiang's attempt to exercise dual leadership with Hu on the model of Deng Xiaoping.[87]\n\n\nOn 19 September 2004, after the 4th Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee, Jiang, at the age of 78, relinquished his post as chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, his last post in the party. Six months later in March 2005, Jiang resigned his last significant post, chairman of the Central Military Commission of the state, which marked the end of Jiang's political career.[*clarification needed*] This followed weeks of speculation that forces inside the party were pressing Jiang to step aside. Jiang's term was supposed to have lasted until 2007. Hu also succeeded Jiang as the CMC chairman, but, in an apparent political defeat for Jiang, General Xu Caihou, and not Zeng Qinghong was appointed to succeed Hu as vice chairman, as was initially speculated. This power transition formally marked the end of Jiang's era in China, which roughly lasted from 1989 to 2004.[88]\n\n\nIn 2008, Jiang published an academic article on China's clean energy resources and another on China's information technology development.[89]: 100\n\n\n\n### Official appearances after retirement[edit]\n\n\nJiang continued to make official appearances after giving up his last title in 2004. In China's strictly defined protocol sequence, Jiang's name always appeared immediately after Hu Jintao's and in front of the remaining sitting members of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee. In 2007, Jiang was seen with Hu Jintao on stage at a ceremony celebrating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army,[90] and toured the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution with Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and other former senior officials.[91] On 8 August 2008, Jiang appeared at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics.[92] He also stood beside Hu Jintao during the mass parade celebrating the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in October 2009.[93]\n\n\nBeginning in July 2011, false reports of Jiang's death began circulating on the news media outside of mainland China and on the internet.[94][95] While Jiang may indeed have been ill and receiving treatment, the rumors were denied by official sources.[96] On 9 October 2011, Jiang made his first public appearance since his premature obituary in Beijing at a celebration to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution.[97] Jiang reappeared at the 18th Party Congress in October 2012, and took part in the 65th Anniversary banquet of the founding of the People's Republic of China in October 2014. At the banquet he sat next to Xi Jinping, who had then succeeded Hu Jintao as CCP general secretary. In September 2015, Jiang attended the parade celebrating 70 years since end of World War II; there, Jiang again sat next to Xi Jinping and Hu Jintao.[98] He appeared on 29 May 2017 at Shanghai Technology University.[99]\n\n\nAfter Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012, Jiang's position in the protocol sequence of leaders retreated; while he was often seated next to Xi Jinping at official events, his name was often reported after all standing members of the Communist Party's Politburo.[100] Jiang reappeared at the 19th Party Congress on 18 October 2017.[101] He appeared on 29 July 2019 at the funeral of former premier Li Peng.[102][103][104] He also attended the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China mass parade in October 2019, marking his last public appearance prior to his death.[105] He did not attend the 20th Party Congress in October 2022.[106]\n\n\n\n## Family and personal life[edit]\n\n\nJiang married Wang Yeping, also a native of Yangzhou, in 1949.[107] She was his cousin, as Jiang's adoptive mother was Wang's aunt. Wang graduated from Shanghai International Studies University.[108] They had two sons together, Jiang Mianheng and Jiang Miankang.[109] Jiang Mianheng went on to be an academic and businessman, working within the Chinese space program, and founded Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation.[110]\n\n\nIt is believed that Jiang had a long-running friendship with the singer Song Zuying, Chen Zhili, and others.[111][112][113][114][115][116] Following the rise of Xi Jinping, Song and other Jiang loyalists, including her brother Song Zuyu, fell under investigation for corruption.[117][118]\n\n\nJiang had a passable command of several foreign languages,[119] including English and Russian. Jiang remains the only paramount leader of China known to be able to speak in English.[119] He enjoyed engaging foreign visitors in small talk on arts and literature in their native language, in addition to singing foreign songs in the original. In 1987, he sang *When We Were Young* and danced with Dianne Feinstein, who was mayor of San Francisco at the time.[120] Jiang also played the ukulele during his 1997 visit to Hawai'i.[120]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Service for Jiang Zemin at the Great Hall of the People\nMain article: Death and state funeral of Jiang Zemin\n\nJiang died on 30 November 2022, at the age of 96, in Shanghai. According to the Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency, he died at 12:13 pm from leukemia and multiple organ failures.[121][122] On the day of Jiang's death, the government released a notice that the national flags would be flown half-staff in key locations of Beijing and diplomatic missions abroad. Foreigners were not invited to attend official mourning activities.[123]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jiang's inscription engraved on a stone in his hometown, Yangzhou\nThe policies of his successors, Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, have widely been seen as efforts to address perceived imbalances and move away from a sole focus on economic growth toward a broader view of development which incorporates non-economic factors such as health and the environment.[124]\n\n\nDomestically, Jiang's legacy and reputation is mixed. While some[125] people attributed the period of relative stability and growth in the 1990s to Jiang's term, others argue that Jiang did little to correct systemic imbalance and an accumulation of problems which resulted from years of breakneck-pace economic reforms, leaving the next administration facing innumerable challenges, some of which may have been too late to solve.[126]\n\n\nThe fact that Jiang rose to power as the direct beneficiary of the political aftermath of Tiananmen has shaped the perception of his rule. Following the Tiananmen protests, Jiang threw his support behind elder Chen Yun's conservative economic policies, but subsequently changed his allegiance to Deng Xiaoping's reform-oriented agenda following the latter's \"Southern Tour\". This shift was not only seen as the exercise of a political opportunist, it also sowed confusion among party loyalists in regards to what direction the party was headed or what the party truly believed in.[127] While continued economic reforms resulted in an explosion of wealth around the country, it also led to the formation of special interest groups in many sectors of the economy, and the exercise of state power without any meaningful oversight. This opened the way for the sub-optimal distribution of the fruits of growth, and an expanding culture of corruption among bureaucrats and party officials.[126]\n\n\nHistorian and former Xinhua journalist Yang Jisheng wrote that Jiang might well have been given a positive historical assessment had it not been for his decision to 'overstay his welcome' by remaining in the Central Military Commission post after Hu had formally assumed the party leadership. Moreover, Jiang took credit for all the gains made during the 13 years \"between 1989 and 2002\", which not only evoked the memories of Jiang being a beneficiary of Tiananmen, but also neglected the economic foundations laid by Deng, whose authority was still paramount until the mid-1990s. Additionally, Jiang was also criticized for his insistence on writing the \"Three Represents\" into the party and state constitutions (see below), which Yang called Jiang's attempt at \"self-deification\", i.e., that he saw himself as a visionary along the same lines as Deng and Mao. Yang contended, \"The 'Three Represents' is just common sense. It is not a proper theoretical framework. It's what any ruler would tell the people to justify the continued rule of the governing party.\"[128]\n\n\nJiang did not specialize in economics, and in 1997 handed most of the economic governance of the country to premier Zhu Rongji and remained in office through the Asian financial crisis. Under their joint leadership, Mainland China sustained an average of 8% GDP growth annually, achieving the highest rate of per capita economic growth in major world economies, raising eyebrows around the world with its astonishing speed. This was mostly achieved by continuing the process of a transition to a market economy. Additionally, he helped increase China's international standing with China joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 and Beijing winning the bid to host the 2008 Summer Olympics.[129]\n\n\nSome have also associated Jiang with the widespread corruption and cronyism that had become a notable feature of the Communist power apparatus since Jiang's years in power. In the military, the two vice-chairmen who sat atop the Central Military Commission hierarchy – nominally as assistants to then chairman Hu Jintao – Vice Chairmen Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, were said to have obstructed Hu Jintao's exercise of power in the military. Xu and Guo were characterized as \"Jiang's proxies in the military\". Eventually, both men were reported to have taken massive bribes, and both fell under the axe of the anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping.[130]\n\n\nAt the same time, many biographers of Jiang have noted his government resembled an oligarchy as opposed to an autocratic dictatorship.[131] Many of the policies of his era had been attributed to others in government, notably premier Zhu Rongji. Jiang was also characterized as a leader who was mindful to seek the opinion of his close advisers. Jiang is often credited with the improvement in foreign relations during his term,[132] but at the same time many Chinese have criticized him for being too conciliatory towards the United States and Russia. The issue of Chinese unification between the mainland and Taiwan gained ground during Jiang's term.[133]\n\n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Decoration\n | Country\n | Date\n | Note\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Order of José Martí | ![](image) Cuba | 21 November 1993\n | Order of Cuba\n | [134] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of the Southern Cross | ![](image) Brazil | 23 November 1993\n | Brazilian order of chivalry\n | [135] |\n| ![](image) | First Class of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise | ![](image) Ukraine | 2 December 1995\n | Award of Ukraine\n | [136] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the National Order of Mali | ![](image) Mali | 17 May 1996\n | The highest honorific order of Mali\n | [137] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Great Star of Djibouti\n | ![](image) Djibouti | 18 August 1998\n | Order of Djibouti\n | [138] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of Good Hope | ![](image) South Africa | 5 May 1999\n | Order of merit of South Africa\n | [139] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Golden Eagle | ![](image) Kazakhstan | 19 November 1999\n | The highest order of Kazakhstan\n | [140] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of Merit\n | ![](image) Republic of the Congo | 20 March 2000\n | Order of the Republic of Congo\n | [141] |\n| ![](image) | Medal 'Bethlehem 2000'\n | ![](image) Palestine | 15 April 2000\n | Medal of the State of Palestine\n | [142] |\n| ![](image) | First Class of the Order of the State of Republic of Turkey | ![](image) Turkey | 19 April 2000\n | The highest state order awarded to foreigners\n | [143] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer | ![](image) Greece | 22 April 2000\n | Highest decoration of Greece\n | [144] |\n| ![](image) | Athens Gold Medal\n | ![](image) Greece | 22 April 2000\n | Medal of Athens | [145] |\n| ![](image) | Royal Family Order of the Crown of Brunei | ![](image) Brunei | 17 November 2000\n | Order of Brunei\n | [146] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of Tahiti Nui | ![](image) French Polynesia | 3 April 2001\n | Order of French Polynesia\n | [147][148] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cordon of the Order of the Liberator | ![](image) Venezuela | 17 April 2001\n | The highest order of Venezuela\n | [149] |\n| ![](image) | Medal of Pushkin | ![](image) Russia | 31 October 2007\n | State decoration of Russia\n | [150] |\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* Jiang Zemin (2010). *Selected Works of Jiang Zemin*.

Jiang was the third paramount leader of China from 1989 to 2002. He was the core leader of the third generation of Chinese leadership, one of four core leaders alongside Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Xi Jinping.\n\n\nBorn in Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Jiang joined the CCP while he was in college. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he received training at the Stalin Automobile Works in Moscow in the 1950s, later returning to Shanghai in 1962 to serve in various institutes, later being sent between 1970 and 1972 to Romania as part of an expert team to establish machinery manufacturing plants in the country. After 1979, he was appointed as the vice chair of two commissions by vice premier Gu Mu to oversee the newly established special economic zones (SEZs). He became the vice minister of the newly established Ministry of Electronics Industry and a member of the CCP Central Committee in 1982.\n\n\nJiang was appointed as the mayor of Shanghai in 1985, later being promoted to its Communist Party secretary, as well as a member of the CCP Politburo, in 1987. Jiang came to power unexpectedly as a compromise candidate following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, when he replaced Zhao Ziyang as CCP general secretary after Zhao was ousted for his support for the student movement. As the involvement of the \"Eight Elders\" in Chinese politics steadily declined,[1] Jiang consolidated his hold on power to become the \"paramount leader\" in the country during the 1990s.[b] Urged by Deng Xiaoping's southern tour in 1992, Jiang officially introduced the term \"socialist market economy\" in his speech during the 14th CCP National Congress held later that year, which accelerated \"opening up and reform\".[2]\n\n\nUnder Jiang's leadership, China experienced substantial economic growth with the continuation of market reforms. The returning of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997 and of Macau from Portugal in 1999, and entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, were landmark moments of his era.[3] China also witnessed improved relations with the outside world, while the Communist Party maintained its tight control over the state. Jiang faced criticism over human rights abuses, including the crackdown on the Falun Gong movement. His contributions to party doctrine, known as the \"Three Represents\", were written into the CCP constitution in 2002. Jiang gradually vacated his official leadership titles from 2002 to 2005, being succeeded in these roles by Hu Jintao, although he and his political faction continued to influence affairs until much later. In 2022, Jiang died in Shanghai.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Graduation photo of Jiang, taken in 1947\nJiang Zemin was born in the city of Yangzhou, Jiangsu, on 17 August 1926.[4] His ancestral home was the Jiangcun Village (江村) in Jingde County, Anhui. This was also the hometown of a number of prominent figures in Chinese academic and intellectual establishments.[5] Jiang grew up during the years of Japanese occupation. His uncle and foster father, Jiang Shangqing, died fighting the Japanese and was considered in Jiang Zemin's time to be a national hero.[6]: 40 After Shangqing's death, Zemin became his male heir.[7]\n\n\nJiang attended the Department of Electrical Engineering at the National Central University in Japanese-occupied Nanjing before transferring to National Chiao Tung University (now Shanghai Jiao Tong University). He graduated there in 1947 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.[8] Jiang joined the Chinese Communist Party when he was in college.[9] After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Jiang received his training at the Stalin Automobile Works in Moscow in the 1950s.[10] He also worked for Changchun's First Automobile Works.[11] As Jiang became increasingly involved in the Communist Party, his main work shifted from the technical side of engineering to administrative and political tasks.[6]: 140\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jiang in 1962\nIn 1962, he returned to Shanghai and became the deputy director of the Shanghai Electric Research Institute. In 1966, he was appointed as the director and deputy party secretary of a thermal engineering research institute in Wuhan, which was established by the First Ministry of Machine Building. When the Cultural Revolution began in the same year, he did not suffer greatly during the turmoil, but was pulled down from his position as director of the institute and was sent to a May Seventh Cadre School. In 1970, after leaving the cadre school, he became the deputy director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the ministry and was sent to the Socialist Republic of Romania, where he served as head of the expert team to establish fifteen machinery manufacturing plants in the country. After the completion of his mission in 1972, he returned to China.[12][13][14]\n\n\nIn 1979, following a thawing of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, Deng Xiaoping decided to encourage special economic zones (SEZs) as part of his Four Modernizations.[15] China's State Council established two ministerial commissions to increase trade and foreign investment. The commissions were headed by vice premier Gu Mu, who appointed Jiang as vice chairman of both commissions, a position equivalent to vice minister.[16] Jiang's role was to ensure these SEZs increased economic prosperity without becoming \"conduits\" for foreign ideology.[16] In 1980, Jiang headed a delegation which toured other SEZs in twelve countries; upon his return, he issued a radical report which recommended allowing local authorities to issue tax breaks and land leases, and increasing the power of foreign joint ventures.[17] The report initially \"caused consternation\" among party leaders, but his pragmatic and empirical presentation appealed to Deng Xiaoping. His proposals were approved at the National People's Congress, cementing Jiang as an \"early implementer\" of Deng Xiaoping Theory.[18]\n\n\nIn March 1982, he was pushed out as vice chairman of two commissions. After pressure from premier Gu and Shanghai mayor Wang Daohan, \"ardent reformist\" Zhao Ziyang appointed Jiang as the first vice minister and party secretary of the newly established Ministry of Electronics Industry.[19]\n\n\nAt the 12th Party Congress held in September 1982, Jiang became a member of the Central Committee of the CCP, which determines policy and elects the members of the Politburo.[19]\n\n\n\n## Career in Shanghai[edit]\n\n\nIn 1985, Jiang became mayor of Shanghai. Jiang received mixed reviews as mayor. Many of his critics dismissed him as a \"flower pot\", a Chinese term for someone who only seems useful, but actually gets nothing done.[20] Many credited Shanghai's growth during the period to Zhu Rongji.[21] Jiang was an ardent believer, during this period, in Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms. In an attempt to curb student discontent in 1986, Jiang recited the Gettysburg Address in English in front of a group of student protesters.[22][23][24]\n\n\nAt the 13th National Congress of the CCP held in October 1987, Jiang was promoted from mayor to Shanghai party secretary, the most powerful position in the city, reporting directly to the central government.[25] He also joined the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with customs for party secretaries of major cities.[25]\n\n\n\n### Tiananmen Square protests[edit]\n\n\nIn April 1989, former general secretary Hu Yaobang died; he had previously been forced to resign in January 1987 and accused of supporting \"bourgeois liberalization\".[22] His death catalyzed the Tiananmen Square protests,[26] leading to an ideological crisis between \"liberals\" (who supported Deng's aggressive reforms) and \"conservatives\" (who favored slower change).[27] After the Shanghai-based *World Economic Herald* tried to publish a eulogy rehabilitating Hu and praising his reformist stance, Jiang took control of the newspaper's editorial board.[28][29] As the protests continued to grow, the Party imposed martial law and deploy troops in Beijing in May.[30] In Shanghai, 100,000 protestors marched in the streets, and 450 students went on a hunger strike.[31] After the third day, Jiang personally met with them to assure them that the Party shared their goals, and to promise future dialogue. He simultaneously sent a telegram to the Central Committee firmly supporting their martial law declaration.[30]\n\n\nHis careful public appeals were well received by both pro-democracy students and socialist party elders.[32] On 20 May 1989, paramount leader Deng Xiaoping decided to appoint Jiang as the new general secretary, replacing Zhao Ziyang,[32] who had supported the protestors.[33][34] Jiang was selected as a compromise candidate over Tianjin's Li Ruihuan, premier Li Peng, elders Li Xiannian, Chen Yun, and the retired elders to become the new general secretary.[35] Before that, he had been considered to be an unlikely candidate.[36]\n\n\n\n## Rise to power[edit]\n\n\nJiang was appointed as general secretary at the fourth plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee on 24 June 1989 with a fairly small power base inside the party, and thus, very little actual power.[37][9] His most reliable allies were the powerful party elders Chen Yun and Li Xiannian. He was believed to be simply a transitional figure until a more stable successor government to Deng could be put in place.[38] Other prominent Party and military figures like President Yang Shangkun and his brother Yang Baibing were believed to be planning a coup.[39]\n\n\nAt the first meeting of the new CCP Politburo Standing Committee, after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, Jiang criticized the previous period as \"hard on the economy, soft on politics\" and advocated increasing political thought work.[40] Anne-Marie Brady wrote that \"Jiang Zemin was a long time political cadre with a nose for ideological work and its importance. This meeting marked the beginning of a new era in propaganda and political thought work in China.\" Soon after, the Central Propaganda Department was given more resources and power, \"including the power to go in to the propaganda-related work units and cleanse the ranks of those who had been supportive of the democracy movement.\"[40]\n\n\nThe Politburo also issued a list of \"seven things\" regarding \"matters of universal concern to the masses\", with party corruption as the top priority.[41] Jiang was also appointed as the chairman of the Central Military Commission on 9 November 1989, succeeding Deng,[42] and president of the PRC on 27 March 1993;[43] this marked the start of the arrangement in which the paramount leader of China simultaneously serves as Party leader, president and chair of the CMC.[44]\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the People's Republic of China (1989–2002)\nIn the first few years, Jiang depended on the support of Deng Xiaoping to remain in power,[45] which forced Jiang into an \"ultranationalist stance\" towards Taiwan and the US.[46] Jiang had supported Deng's calls against \"bourgeois liberalization\", but while Jiang was seen as a \"thoughtful reformer\",[47] he \"[skewed] to the more conservative views of the elders and his Politburo colleagues\".[48] Deng was far more supportive of reforms, saying that \"deviating to the Left is an even greater danger\" than deviating to the right.[49]\n\n\nDeng grew critical of Jiang's leadership in 1992. During Deng's southern tour, he subtly suggested that the pace of reform was not fast enough.[50] Jiang grew ever more cautious, and rallied behind Deng's reforms completely. Jiang coined the new \"socialist market economy\" to move China's centrally-planned socialist economy into essentially a government-regulated market economy.[51] It was a huge step to take in the realization of Deng's \"Socialism with Chinese characteristics.\"[52] At the same time, Jiang elevated many of his supporters from Shanghai to high government positions, after regaining Deng's confidence. He abolished the outdated Central Advisory Commission in 1992, an advisory body composed of revolutionary party elders.\n\n\n\n### Economic development[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, post-Tiananmen economic reforms by Zhu Rongji with Jiang's support had stabilized and the country was on a consistent growth trajectory. At the same time, China faced myriad economic and social problems. At Deng's state funeral in 1997, Jiang delivered the elder statesman's eulogy. Jiang had inherited a China rampant with political corruption, and regional economies growing too rapidly for the stability of the entire country. Deng's policy that \"some areas can get rich before others\" led to an opening wealth gap between coastal regions and the interior provinces. The unprecedented economic growth and the deregulation in a number of heavy industries led to the closing of many state-owned enterprises (SOEs), breaking many people's iron rice bowl and initially removing as many as 40 million jobs from SOEs.[53][54] As a result, unemployment rates skyrocketed, rising as high as 40% in some urban areas. Stock markets fluctuated greatly. The scale of rural migration into urban areas was unprecedented anywhere, and little was being done to address an ever-increasing urban-rural wealth gap. Official reports put the figure on the percentage of China's GDP being moved and abused by corrupt officials at 10%.[55]\n\n\nJiang's biggest aim in the economy was stability, and he believed that a stable government with highly centralized power would be a prerequisite, choosing to postpone political reform, which in many facets of governance exacerbated the ongoing problems.[56] After the coastal regions and SEZs were sufficiently developed, Jiang worked to reduce geographic disparities by encouraging richer cities to \"provide financial, technological, and managerial assistance to the poorer, western ones.\"[57] The construction various infrastructure projects such as the Qinghai–Tibet railway and the Three Gorges Dam began under Jiang's leadership.[58]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jiang with US president Bill Clinton in 1999\n![](image)Jiang with President of Russia Vladimir Putin at APEC summit in Shanghai (2001)\nUnder Jiang's leadership, China continued its style of developmental diplomacy which had been adopted under Deng Xiaoping.[59] China's international behavior was generally both pragmatic and predictable.[59] During Jiang's presidency, serious flare-ups between China and the United States occurred.[60] Nonetheless, Jiang's foreign policy was for the most part passive and non-confrontational.\n\n\nIn July 1993, the United States Navy stopped a Chinese container ship, the *Yinhe*, based on the incorrect suspicion that it was carrying chemical weapon precursors bound for Iran.[61] Although China denied the allegation, the United States cut off the *Yinhe*'s GPS, causing it to lose direction and anchor on the high seas for twenty-four days until it acceded to an inspection.[61] There were no chemical precursors on the ship.[61] Although China sought a formal apology, the United States refused to apologize and refused to pay compensation.[61] Despite the humiliation of the *Yinhe* incident, Jiang took a stance of goodwill towards the United States and adopted the \"sixteen-characters formula\" for working with the United States: \"enhancing confidence, reducing troubles, expanding cooperation, and avoiding confrontation.\"[61]\n\n\nJiang oversaw a series of missile tests in the waters surrounding Taiwan in 1996 in protest to the Republic of China government under President Lee Teng-hui, who had been seen as moving its foreign policy away from the One-China policy.\n\n\nJiang went on a state visit to the United States in 1997, drawing various crowds in protest from the Tibet Independence Movement to supporters of the Chinese democracy movement. He made a speech at Harvard University, part of it in English, but could not escape questions on democracy and freedom. In the official summit meeting with president Bill Clinton, the tone was relaxed as they sought common ground while largely ignoring areas of disagreement. Clinton would visit China in June 1998, and vowed that China and the United States were partners in the world, and not adversaries.[62]\n\n\nAfter the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999, Jiang seemed to have put up a harsh stance for show at home, but in reality only performed symbolic gestures of protest, and no solid action.[56] Jiang deemed the United States-China bilateral relation too important to be harmed in the emotion of the moment and sought to soothe the Chinese public's outrage.[63]\n\n\nThe Hainan island incident was another tense event in the China-United States relations which occurred during Jiang's presidency.[64] On April 1, 2001, a United States US EP-3 surveillance aircraft collided mid-air with a Chinese Shenyang J-8 jet fighter over the South China Sea.[64] China sought a formal apology, and accepted United States Secretary of State Colin Powell's expression of \"very sorry\" as sufficient.[64] The incident nonetheless created negative feelings towards the United States by the Chinese public and increased public feelings of Chinese nationalism.[64]\n\n\nA personal friend of former Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien,[65] Jiang strengthened China's economic stature abroad, attempting to establish cordial relations with countries whose trade is largely confined to the American economic sphere.\n\n\n\n### Media depiction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jiang Zemin delivered a speech at the South Korean National Assembly in 1995\nThe *People's Daily* and CCTV-1's 7 pm *Xinwen Lianbo* each had Jiang-related events as the front-page or top stories, a fact that remained until Hu Jintao's media administrative changes in 2006. Jiang appeared casual in front of Western media, and gave an unprecedented interview with Mike Wallace of CBS in 2000 at Beidaihe. He would often use foreign languages in front of the camera; once, he gave a 40-minute speech entirely in Russian.[66] In an encounter with Hong Kong reporter Sharon Cheung in 2000 regarding the central government's apparent \"imperial order\" of supporting Tung Chee-hwa to seek a second term as Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Jiang scolded the Hong Kong journalists as \"too simple, sometimes naive\" in English.[67]\n\n\n\n### \"Three Represents\"[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Three Represents\n\nOn 25 February 2000, Jiang introduced the theory of Three Represents, which was later enshrined in both Party and State constitutions as an \"important thought\", following in the footsteps of Marxism–Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.[68][69] Officially termed as the latest development of socialism with Chinese characters under Jiang's tenure,[70] the Three Represents justified the incorporation of the new capitalist business class into the party, and changed the founding ideology of the CCP from protecting the interests of the peasantry and workers to that of the \"overwhelming majority of the people\", a euphemism aimed at placating the growing entrepreneurial class. Conservative critics within the party, such as hardline leftist Deng Liqun, denounced this as betrayal of \"true\" communist ideology.[68]\n\n\nBefore he transferred power to a younger generation of leaders, Jiang had his theory of Three Represents written into the Party's constitution, alongside Marxism–Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory at the 16th CCP Congress in 2002.[71]\n\n\n\n### Crackdown on Falun Gong[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Persecution of Falun Gong\n\nIn June 1999, Jiang established an extralegal department, the 610 Office, to crack down on Falun Gong. Cook and Lemish state this was because Jiang was worried that the popular new religious movement was \"quietly infiltrating the CCP and state apparatus.\"[72] On 20 July, security forces arrested thousands of Falun Gong organizers they identified as leaders.[73] The persecution that followed was characterized a nationwide campaign of propaganda, as well as the large-scale arbitrary imprisonment and coercive reeducation of Falun Gong organizers, sometimes resulting in death due to mistreatment in detention.[74][75][76]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Shanghai clique\n\n![](image)Jiang with his wife and George W. Bush with his wife in Crawford, Texas, 25 October 2002\nIn the run-up to the 16th National Congress of the CCP, Hu Jintao had \"almost unanimous support\" to become the new CCP general secretary.[77] To maintain China's image as a stable and respected country, Jiang and Hu emphasized their unity, striving to make this transition the first \"smooth and harmonious\" one in the PRC's history.[78][79] Jiang stepped down as general secretary and left the Politburo Standing Committee, but retained the chairmanship of the Central Military Commission,[80] which controlled the army and the nation's foreign policy.[81] Jiang would continue conselling Hu from \"behind the curtain\", and it was formally agreed that Jiang would be \"consulted on all matters of state importance\".[81] Both men also reached a \"tacit understanding\" that Hu would not be considered a \"core\" leader like Jiang, Deng and Mao.[82]\n\n\nAt the 16th Party Congress, the majority of new members for Standing Committee were considered part of Jiang's so-called \"Shanghai clique\", the most prominent being vice president Zeng Qinghong, who had served as Jiang's chief of staff for many years, and vice premier Huang Ju, a former party secretary of Shanghai.[83]\n\n\nAfter Hu succeeded Jiang as general secretary, the latter continued to \"[dominate] public life\" for several years.[84] The *South China Morning Post* announced that \"a new era has begun in China. But it is not that of Vice President Hu Jintao [...] Rather, it is a new era of President Jiang Zemin, who has just stepped down as the Party's general secretary.\"[80] Early in the 2003 SARS crisis, Jiang remained conspicuously silent, and observers were divided over whether it signified his waning influence, or respect for Hu.[85] It has been argued that the institutional arrangements created by the 16th Congress left Jiang in a position where he could not exercise much influence.[86]\n\n\nAlthough Jiang retained the chairmanship of the CMC, most members of the commission were professional military men. *People's Liberation Army Daily*, a publication thought to represent the views of the CMC majority, printed an article on 11 March 2003 which quotes two army delegates as saying, \"Having one center is called 'loyalty', while having two centers will result in 'problems.'\" This was interpreted as a criticism of Jiang's attempt to exercise dual leadership with Hu on the model of Deng Xiaoping.[87]\n\n\nOn 19 September 2004, after the 4th Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee, Jiang, at the age of 78, relinquished his post as chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, his last post in the party. Six months later in March 2005, Jiang resigned his last significant post, chairman of the Central Military Commission of the state, which marked the end of Jiang's political career.[*clarification needed*] This followed weeks of speculation that forces inside the party were pressing Jiang to step aside. Jiang's term was supposed to have lasted until 2007. Hu also succeeded Jiang as the CMC chairman, but, in an apparent political defeat for Jiang, General Xu Caihou, and not Zeng Qinghong was appointed to succeed Hu as vice chairman, as was initially speculated. This power transition formally marked the end of Jiang's era in China, which roughly lasted from 1989 to 2004.[88]\n\n\nIn 2008, Jiang published an academic article on China's clean energy resources and another on China's information technology development.[89]: 100\n\n\n\n### Official appearances after retirement[edit]\n\n\nJiang continued to make official appearances after giving up his last title in 2004. In China's strictly defined protocol sequence, Jiang's name always appeared immediately after Hu Jintao's and in front of the remaining sitting members of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee. In 2007, Jiang was seen with Hu Jintao on stage at a ceremony celebrating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army,[90] and toured the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution with Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and other former senior officials.[91] On 8 August 2008, Jiang appeared at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics.[92] He also stood beside Hu Jintao during the mass parade celebrating the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in October 2009.[93]\n\n\nBeginning in July 2011, false reports of Jiang's death began circulating on the news media outside of mainland China and on the internet.[94][95] While Jiang may indeed have been ill and receiving treatment, the rumors were denied by official sources.[96] On 9 October 2011, Jiang made his first public appearance since his premature obituary in Beijing at a celebration to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution.[97] Jiang reappeared at the 18th Party Congress in October 2012, and took part in the 65th Anniversary banquet of the founding of the People's Republic of China in October 2014. At the banquet he sat next to Xi Jinping, who had then succeeded Hu Jintao as CCP general secretary. In September 2015, Jiang attended the parade celebrating 70 years since end of World War II; there, Jiang again sat next to Xi Jinping and Hu Jintao.[98] He appeared on 29 May 2017 at Shanghai Technology University.[99]\n\n\nAfter Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012, Jiang's position in the protocol sequence of leaders retreated; while he was often seated next to Xi Jinping at official events, his name was often reported after all standing members of the Communist Party's Politburo.[100] Jiang reappeared at the 19th Party Congress on 18 October 2017.[101] He appeared on 29 July 2019 at the funeral of former premier Li Peng.[102][103][104] He also attended the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China mass parade in October 2019, marking his last public appearance prior to his death.[105] He did not attend the 20th Party Congress in October 2022.[106]\n\n\n\n## Family and personal life[edit]\n\n\nJiang married Wang Yeping, also a native of Yangzhou, in 1949.[107] She was his cousin, as Jiang's adoptive mother was Wang's aunt. Wang graduated from Shanghai International Studies University.[108] They had two sons together, Jiang Mianheng and Jiang Miankang.[109] Jiang Mianheng went on to be an academic and businessman, working within the Chinese space program, and founded Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation.[110]\n\n\nIt is believed that Jiang had a long-running friendship with the singer Song Zuying, Chen Zhili, and others.[111][112][113][114][115][116] Following the rise of Xi Jinping, Song and other Jiang loyalists, including her brother Song Zuyu, fell under investigation for corruption.[117][118]\n\n\nJiang had a passable command of several foreign languages,[119] including English and Russian. Jiang remains the only paramount leader of China known to be able to speak in English.[119] He enjoyed engaging foreign visitors in small talk on arts and literature in their native language, in addition to singing foreign songs in the original. In 1987, he sang *When We Were Young* and danced with Dianne Feinstein, who was mayor of San Francisco at the time.[120] Jiang also played the ukulele during his 1997 visit to Hawai'i.[120]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Service for Jiang Zemin at the Great Hall of the People\nMain article: Death and state funeral of Jiang Zemin\n\nJiang died on 30 November 2022, at the age of 96, in Shanghai. According to the Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency, he died at 12:13 pm from leukemia and multiple organ failures.[121][122] On the day of Jiang's death, the government released a notice that the national flags would be flown half-staff in key locations of Beijing and diplomatic missions abroad. Foreigners were not invited to attend official mourning activities.[123]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jiang's inscription engraved on a stone in his hometown, Yangzhou\nThe policies of his successors, Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, have widely been seen as efforts to address perceived imbalances and move away from a sole focus on economic growth toward a broader view of development which incorporates non-economic factors such as health and the environment.[124]\n\n\nDomestically, Jiang's legacy and reputation is mixed. While some[125] people attributed the period of relative stability and growth in the 1990s to Jiang's term, others argue that Jiang did little to correct systemic imbalance and an accumulation of problems which resulted from years of breakneck-pace economic reforms, leaving the next administration facing innumerable challenges, some of which may have been too late to solve.[126]\n\n\nThe fact that Jiang rose to power as the direct beneficiary of the political aftermath of Tiananmen has shaped the perception of his rule. Following the Tiananmen protests, Jiang threw his support behind elder Chen Yun's conservative economic policies, but subsequently changed his allegiance to Deng Xiaoping's reform-oriented agenda following the latter's \"Southern Tour\". This shift was not only seen as the exercise of a political opportunist, it also sowed confusion among party loyalists in regards to what direction the party was headed or what the party truly believed in.[127] While continued economic reforms resulted in an explosion of wealth around the country, it also led to the formation of special interest groups in many sectors of the economy, and the exercise of state power without any meaningful oversight. This opened the way for the sub-optimal distribution of the fruits of growth, and an expanding culture of corruption among bureaucrats and party officials.[126]\n\n\nHistorian and former Xinhua journalist Yang Jisheng wrote that Jiang might well have been given a positive historical assessment had it not been for his decision to 'overstay his welcome' by remaining in the Central Military Commission post after Hu had formally assumed the party leadership. Moreover, Jiang took credit for all the gains made during the 13 years \"between 1989 and 2002\", which not only evoked the memories of Jiang being a beneficiary of Tiananmen, but also neglected the economic foundations laid by Deng, whose authority was still paramount until the mid-1990s. Additionally, Jiang was also criticized for his insistence on writing the \"Three Represents\" into the party and state constitutions (see below), which Yang called Jiang's attempt at \"self-deification\", i.e., that he saw himself as a visionary along the same lines as Deng and Mao. Yang contended, \"The 'Three Represents' is just common sense. It is not a proper theoretical framework. It's what any ruler would tell the people to justify the continued rule of the governing party.\"[128]\n\n\nJiang did not specialize in economics, and in 1997 handed most of the economic governance of the country to premier Zhu Rongji and remained in office through the Asian financial crisis. Under their joint leadership, Mainland China sustained an average of 8% GDP growth annually, achieving the highest rate of per capita economic growth in major world economies, raising eyebrows around the world with its astonishing speed. This was mostly achieved by continuing the process of a transition to a market economy. Additionally, he helped increase China's international standing with China joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 and Beijing winning the bid to host the 2008 Summer Olympics.[129]\n\n\nSome have also associated Jiang with the widespread corruption and cronyism that had become a notable feature of the Communist power apparatus since Jiang's years in power. In the military, the two vice-chairmen who sat atop the Central Military Commission hierarchy – nominally as assistants to then chairman Hu Jintao – Vice Chairmen Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, were said to have obstructed Hu Jintao's exercise of power in the military. Xu and Guo were characterized as \"Jiang's proxies in the military\". Eventually, both men were reported to have taken massive bribes, and both fell under the axe of the anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping.[130]\n\n\nAt the same time, many biographers of Jiang have noted his government resembled an oligarchy as opposed to an autocratic dictatorship.[131] Many of the policies of his era had been attributed to others in government, notably premier Zhu Rongji. Jiang was also characterized as a leader who was mindful to seek the opinion of his close advisers. Jiang is often credited with the improvement in foreign relations during his term,[132] but at the same time many Chinese have criticized him for being too conciliatory towards the United States and Russia. The issue of Chinese unification between the mainland and Taiwan gained ground during Jiang's term.[133]\n\n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Decoration\n | Country\n | Date\n | Note\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Order of José Martí | ![](image) Cuba | 21 November 1993\n | Order of Cuba\n | [134] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of the Southern Cross | ![](image) Brazil | 23 November 1993\n | Brazilian order of chivalry\n | [135] |\n| ![](image) | First Class of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise | ![](image) Ukraine | 2 December 1995\n | Award of Ukraine\n | [136] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the National Order of Mali | ![](image) Mali | 17 May 1996\n | The highest honorific order of Mali\n | [137] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Great Star of Djibouti\n | ![](image) Djibouti | 18 August 1998\n | Order of Djibouti\n | [138] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of Good Hope | ![](image) South Africa | 5 May 1999\n | Order of merit of South Africa\n | [139] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Golden Eagle | ![](image) Kazakhstan | 19 November 1999\n | The highest order of Kazakhstan\n | [140] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of Merit\n | ![](image) Republic of the Congo | 20 March 2000\n | Order of the Republic of Congo\n | [141] |\n| ![](image) | Medal 'Bethlehem 2000'\n | ![](image) Palestine | 15 April 2000\n | Medal of the State of Palestine\n | [142] |\n| ![](image) | First Class of the Order of the State of Republic of Turkey | ![](image) Turkey | 19 April 2000\n | The highest state order awarded to foreigners\n | [143] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer | ![](image) Greece | 22 April 2000\n | Highest decoration of Greece\n | [144] |\n| ![](image) | Athens Gold Medal\n | ![](image) Greece | 22 April 2000\n | Medal of Athens | [145] |\n| ![](image) | Royal Family Order of the Crown of Brunei | ![](image) Brunei | 17 November 2000\n | Order of Brunei\n | [146] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of Tahiti Nui | ![](image) French Polynesia | 3 April 2001\n | Order of French Polynesia\n | [147][148] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cordon of the Order of the Liberator | ![](image) Venezuela | 17 April 2001\n | The highest order of Venezuela\n | [149] |\n| ![](image) | Medal of Pushkin | ![](image) Russia | 31 October 2007\n | State decoration of Russia\n | [150] |\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* Jiang Zemin (2010). *Selected Works of Jiang Zemin*.

He went on to hold high office under both Mao Zedong and later Deng Xiaoping; from 1945 to 1965 he was Director of the General Office and from 1945 to 1956 Secretary–General of the Central Military Commission (CMC). In these positions, Yang oversaw much of the day-to-day running of government and Party affairs, both political and military, amassing a great deal of bureaucratic power by controlling things like the flow of documents, the keeping of records, and the approval and allocation of funds.[2] Purged, arrested and imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, he spent 12 years in prison but staged a comeback in 1978, becoming a key ally of Deng, serving as Mayor of Guangzhou (1979–81), and returning to the CMC as Secretary–General and also Vice Chairman (1981–89), before assuming the presidency.[2]\n\n\nOne of the earliest supporters of Chinese economic reform, Yang justified it with references to Vladimir Lenin and the New Economic Policy. However, he strongly opposed any form of political reform, and, despite his own suffering during the Cultural Revolution, actively defended the image and record of Mao. Together with his half-brother, General Yang Baibing, Yang Shangkun effectively controlled the PLA for the entire 1980s and into the early 1990s. Despite his initial hesitation, he went on to play a leading role in crushing the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and was actually the one who planned and supervised the operations to clear the square and surrounding streets. Yang's downfall came in 1993, when he failed in his attempts to undermine the new leadership of Jiang Zemin and to retain control of the PLA, and was forced to retire by a coalition of Party elders, including Deng himself.\n\n\n\n\n## Early political and military activities[edit]\n\n\nYang was born to a land-owning family[3] in Shuangjiang, Tongnan County, near the city of Chongqing in Sichuan, and studied at Chengdu Higher Normal School and its affiliated secondary school in 1920–25, and then returned to Chongqing. His older brother, Yang Yingong[4] was one of the founding Executive Committee members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Sichuan, and influenced Yang Shangkun's ideological orientation. After joining the Communist Youth League in 1925, and the CCP in 1926, he enrolled in Shanghai University, where he studied politics.[5] Later in 1927 Yang traveled to the Soviet Union and enrolled at the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University, where he studied Marxist theory and techniques of political organization and mobilization.[2][3]\n\n\nYang was a member of a group of Chinese students who studied in Moscow and returned to China to take a leading role in the CCP, later known as the 28 Bolsheviks.[5] The Comintern sent Yang back to China to assist and support other pro-Comintern CCP leaders, including Bo Gu, Wang Ming, and Zhang Guotao, but Yang and some of the other 28 Bolsheviks, including Ye Jianying, Wang Jiaxiang and Zhang Wentian supported Mao Zedong instead. On his return from Moscow in 1931, Yang Shangkun started his military career in the Chinese Red Army, serving as Director of the Political Department in the 1st Red Army and moving around different battle areas under the command of Zhu De and Zhou Enlai. In January 1934, he was appointed Political Commissar of the 3rd Red Army, commanded by Peng Dehuai.[6]\n\n\n\n## Second Sino–Japanese War and Chinese Civil War[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Second Sino–Japanese War Yang Shangkun was Deputy Secretary of the CCP North China Bureau and worked with Liu Shaoqi behind the Japanese lines. In January 1939, Yang became Secretary of the North China Bureau and worked with Zhu De and Peng Dehuai to cooperate with the military operations of the Eighth Route Army, including the Hundred Regiments Campaign. In 1941, Yang returned to Yan'an and worked as personal aide to Mao. In 1945, he became the Director of the General Office of the Party, as well as Secretary–General of the Central Military Commission, that was chaired by Mao himself. In these capacities, he was responsible for much of the day-to-day administration of the Party's military and political work, and carried out this duty with much success.[2]\n\n\nIn the subsequent Chinese Civil War 1949, Yang was Commander of the \"*Central Security Force*\" protecting the Party Center, and, in his roles as Director of the General Office and Secretary–General of the CMC, played a significant role in the ultimate Communist victory and the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.[3]\n\n\n\n## People's Republic[edit]\n\n\nAfter the founding of the PRC in October 1949 and until the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Yang Shangkun was one of very few CCP leaders who worked closely with Mao Zedong at Zhongnanhai on a daily basis. As the Director of the General Office and Secretary–General of the CMC, he oversaw much of the actual day-to-day work of most party activities and military affairs.[3] On the eve of the Cultural Revolution Yang was identified as a supporter of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, and was purged as a counter-revolutionary.[7] After being ejected from the Communist Party and removed from all positions, Yang was persecuted by Red Guards, who accused Yang of planting a covert listening device to spy on Mao, the same accusation shared by Deng Xiaoping.\n\n\nYang remained in prison until Mao died and Deng Xiaoping rose to power, in 1978. After Deng gained control of the military he recalled Yang, raised him to the position of general, and gave Yang the responsibility of reforming China's army, which Deng considered as larger than necessary and engaged in too many non-military activities. Deng raised Yang to the position of Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission in order to give Yang the authority to complete these reforms (Deng was chairman). In 1982 Yang was also appointed as a full member of the Politburo.[8]\n\n\nYang had a close friendship with Deng and shared many of Deng's long-term economic goals, but was far less enthusiastic about the agenda of political liberalization promoted by other senior leaders favored by Deng, including Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang, Wan Li, and Hu Qili. Yang justified his support of economic reforms by referencing Vladimir Lenin and the New Economic Policy, and he emphasized that the Communist Party should still enjoy overall control of the economy, even in private businesses, through the system of Party committees in all enterprises. He also always defended Mao Zedong as a great and historic leader, despite his own suffering at the hands of radical Maoists.\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, Yang explicitly backed the efforts of a foreign China historian, Harrison Salisbury, to compile an account of the Long March by conducting extensive interviews with surviving Long March participants. The resulting book, *Long March: The Untold Story*, has been praised by China scholars as an excellent synthesis of first-hand oral sources. Within China, many Chinese veterans asked why it took a foreigner to produce such a book.[9]\n\n\n\n## Presidency[edit]\n\n\nFile:Bush and Yang 5-1987.jpgYang with Vice President George H. W. Bush aboard the USS *Sequoia* during his visit to the United States in 1987\nIn 1988, Yang was appointed President of the People's Republic of China replacing Li Xiannian. Under the conventions of the 1982 Constitution, the president's role was largely symbolic,[8] with formal executive power wielded by the General Secretary of the Communist Party and the Premier of the State Council. In practice, party and state leaders still deferred to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who, however, was not all-powerful, as he still had to compromise on some policies with other party elders such as Chen Yun and Li Xiannian.\n\n\nYang's role during the Tiananmen protests of 1989 caused a fundamental shift in China's political structure. Yang was at first sympathetic to the students and sided with General Secretary Zhao Ziyang in supporting them. As the Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Central Military Commission, he even praised Zhao's position by claiming that Zhao \"Ziyang’s notion of pacifying the student movement through democracy and law is good and seems quite workable right now.\" Zhao's position was contested by Premier Li Peng and Party elder Li Xiannian, who wanted to use force to suppress the student demonstrations and engaged in an internal power struggle with Zhao to convince other senior leaders of their position.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter the hardliners gained the upper hand, Yang changed his position and supported the use of force to suppress student protestors. In May 1989 Yang appeared on Chinese television, where he denounced the student demonstrations as \"anarchy\" and defended the imposition of martial law on several areas of Beijing affected by the protests. Yang then mobilized and planned the suppression of the demonstrators, an operation in which several hundred protesters were killed on 4 June and subsequent days.[8] Yang's nephew, Yang Jianhua, commanded the highly disciplined 27th Group Army, which was brought into Beijing from Hebei to suppress the demonstrators.\n\n\n\n![](image)Yang (first row, fifth from right) at Kim Il Sung's 80th birthday celebrations in 1992\nThroughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Yang Shangkun was hugely influential within the People's Liberation Army. Yang and his younger half-brother, Yang Baibing, purged China's military of any officers who had not sufficiently supported the government's violent crackdown on students. Yang then began an organized attempt to fill as many senior military positions as possible with his supporters, generating an attitude of resentment among other military elders, who accused Yang of attempting to dominate the army and possibly challenge Deng's authority by developing a \"Yang family clique\". When Yang resisted the rise of Jiang Zemin (who had been the Party secretary of Shanghai), whom Deng began to groom to succeed him as paramount leader, party elders, including Deng himself forced Yang to retire in 1993, along with some of his family.[7]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Voice of America, before Yang Shangkun died in 1998, he allegedly told army doctor Jiang Yanyong that the crackdown on 4 June had been the most serious mistake committed by Li Peng and the Communist Party in its history, a mistake that Yang believed he could not correct, but which he believed would eventually be corrected.[10]\n\n\nYang died on 14 September 1998, aged 91. His official obituary described him as \"a great proletarian revolutionary, a statesman, a military strategist, a staunch Marxist, an outstanding leader of the party, the state, and the people's army.\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1929, he married Li Bozhao, a woman who participated in the Long March alongside Yang. They had three sons.[11]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Politics of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"族谱帮大忙，确定杨尚昆诞辰日为8月3日--中国共产党新闻--中国共产党新闻-人民网\".

He went on to hold high office under both Mao Zedong and later Deng Xiaoping; from 1945 to 1965 he was Director of the General Office and from 1945 to 1956 Secretary–General of the Central Military Commission (CMC). In these positions, Yang oversaw much of the day-to-day running of government and Party affairs, both political and military, amassing a great deal of bureaucratic power by controlling things like the flow of documents, the keeping of records, and the approval and allocation of funds.[2] Purged, arrested and imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, he spent 12 years in prison but staged a comeback in 1978, becoming a key ally of Deng, serving as Mayor of Guangzhou (1979–81), and returning to the CMC as Secretary–General and also Vice Chairman (1981–89), before assuming the presidency.[2]\n\n\nOne of the earliest supporters of Chinese economic reform, Yang justified it with references to Vladimir Lenin and the New Economic Policy. However, he strongly opposed any form of political reform, and, despite his own suffering during the Cultural Revolution, actively defended the image and record of Mao. Together with his half-brother, General Yang Baibing, Yang Shangkun effectively controlled the PLA for the entire 1980s and into the early 1990s. Despite his initial hesitation, he went on to play a leading role in crushing the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and was actually the one who planned and supervised the operations to clear the square and surrounding streets. Yang's downfall came in 1993, when he failed in his attempts to undermine the new leadership of Jiang Zemin and to retain control of the PLA, and was forced to retire by a coalition of Party elders, including Deng himself.\n\n\n\n\n## Early political and military activities[edit]\n\n\nYang was born to a land-owning family[3] in Shuangjiang, Tongnan County, near the city of Chongqing in Sichuan, and studied at Chengdu Higher Normal School and its affiliated secondary school in 1920–25, and then returned to Chongqing. His older brother, Yang Yingong[4] was one of the founding Executive Committee members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Sichuan, and influenced Yang Shangkun's ideological orientation. After joining the Communist Youth League in 1925, and the CCP in 1926, he enrolled in Shanghai University, where he studied politics.[5] Later in 1927 Yang traveled to the Soviet Union and enrolled at the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University, where he studied Marxist theory and techniques of political organization and mobilization.[2][3]\n\n\nYang was a member of a group of Chinese students who studied in Moscow and returned to China to take a leading role in the CCP, later known as the 28 Bolsheviks.[5] The Comintern sent Yang back to China to assist and support other pro-Comintern CCP leaders, including Bo Gu, Wang Ming, and Zhang Guotao, but Yang and some of the other 28 Bolsheviks, including Ye Jianying, Wang Jiaxiang and Zhang Wentian supported Mao Zedong instead. On his return from Moscow in 1931, Yang Shangkun started his military career in the Chinese Red Army, serving as Director of the Political Department in the 1st Red Army and moving around different battle areas under the command of Zhu De and Zhou Enlai. In January 1934, he was appointed Political Commissar of the 3rd Red Army, commanded by Peng Dehuai.[6]\n\n\n\n## Second Sino–Japanese War and Chinese Civil War[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Second Sino–Japanese War Yang Shangkun was Deputy Secretary of the CCP North China Bureau and worked with Liu Shaoqi behind the Japanese lines. In January 1939, Yang became Secretary of the North China Bureau and worked with Zhu De and Peng Dehuai to cooperate with the military operations of the Eighth Route Army, including the Hundred Regiments Campaign. In 1941, Yang returned to Yan'an and worked as personal aide to Mao. In 1945, he became the Director of the General Office of the Party, as well as Secretary–General of the Central Military Commission, that was chaired by Mao himself. In these capacities, he was responsible for much of the day-to-day administration of the Party's military and political work, and carried out this duty with much success.[2]\n\n\nIn the subsequent Chinese Civil War 1949, Yang was Commander of the \"*Central Security Force*\" protecting the Party Center, and, in his roles as Director of the General Office and Secretary–General of the CMC, played a significant role in the ultimate Communist victory and the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.[3]\n\n\n\n## People's Republic[edit]\n\n\nAfter the founding of the PRC in October 1949 and until the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Yang Shangkun was one of very few CCP leaders who worked closely with Mao Zedong at Zhongnanhai on a daily basis. As the Director of the General Office and Secretary–General of the CMC, he oversaw much of the actual day-to-day work of most party activities and military affairs.[3] On the eve of the Cultural Revolution Yang was identified as a supporter of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, and was purged as a counter-revolutionary.[7] After being ejected from the Communist Party and removed from all positions, Yang was persecuted by Red Guards, who accused Yang of planting a covert listening device to spy on Mao, the same accusation shared by Deng Xiaoping.\n\n\nYang remained in prison until Mao died and Deng Xiaoping rose to power, in 1978. After Deng gained control of the military he recalled Yang, raised him to the position of general, and gave Yang the responsibility of reforming China's army, which Deng considered as larger than necessary and engaged in too many non-military activities. Deng raised Yang to the position of Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission in order to give Yang the authority to complete these reforms (Deng was chairman). In 1982 Yang was also appointed as a full member of the Politburo.[8]\n\n\nYang had a close friendship with Deng and shared many of Deng's long-term economic goals, but was far less enthusiastic about the agenda of political liberalization promoted by other senior leaders favored by Deng, including Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang, Wan Li, and Hu Qili. Yang justified his support of economic reforms by referencing Vladimir Lenin and the New Economic Policy, and he emphasized that the Communist Party should still enjoy overall control of the economy, even in private businesses, through the system of Party committees in all enterprises. He also always defended Mao Zedong as a great and historic leader, despite his own suffering at the hands of radical Maoists.\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, Yang explicitly backed the efforts of a foreign China historian, Harrison Salisbury, to compile an account of the Long March by conducting extensive interviews with surviving Long March participants. The resulting book, *Long March: The Untold Story*, has been praised by China scholars as an excellent synthesis of first-hand oral sources. Within China, many Chinese veterans asked why it took a foreigner to produce such a book.[9]\n\n\n\n## Presidency[edit]\n\n\nFile:Bush and Yang 5-1987.jpgYang with Vice President George H. W. Bush aboard the USS *Sequoia* during his visit to the United States in 1987\nIn 1988, Yang was appointed President of the People's Republic of China replacing Li Xiannian. Under the conventions of the 1982 Constitution, the president's role was largely symbolic,[8] with formal executive power wielded by the General Secretary of the Communist Party and the Premier of the State Council. In practice, party and state leaders still deferred to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who, however, was not all-powerful, as he still had to compromise on some policies with other party elders such as Chen Yun and Li Xiannian.\n\n\nYang's role during the Tiananmen protests of 1989 caused a fundamental shift in China's political structure. Yang was at first sympathetic to the students and sided with General Secretary Zhao Ziyang in supporting them. As the Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Central Military Commission, he even praised Zhao's position by claiming that Zhao \"Ziyang’s notion of pacifying the student movement through democracy and law is good and seems quite workable right now.\" Zhao's position was contested by Premier Li Peng and Party elder Li Xiannian, who wanted to use force to suppress the student demonstrations and engaged in an internal power struggle with Zhao to convince other senior leaders of their position.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter the hardliners gained the upper hand, Yang changed his position and supported the use of force to suppress student protestors. In May 1989 Yang appeared on Chinese television, where he denounced the student demonstrations as \"anarchy\" and defended the imposition of martial law on several areas of Beijing affected by the protests. Yang then mobilized and planned the suppression of the demonstrators, an operation in which several hundred protesters were killed on 4 June and subsequent days.[8] Yang's nephew, Yang Jianhua, commanded the highly disciplined 27th Group Army, which was brought into Beijing from Hebei to suppress the demonstrators.\n\n\n\n![](image)Yang (first row, fifth from right) at Kim Il Sung's 80th birthday celebrations in 1992\nThroughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Yang Shangkun was hugely influential within the People's Liberation Army. Yang and his younger half-brother, Yang Baibing, purged China's military of any officers who had not sufficiently supported the government's violent crackdown on students. Yang then began an organized attempt to fill as many senior military positions as possible with his supporters, generating an attitude of resentment among other military elders, who accused Yang of attempting to dominate the army and possibly challenge Deng's authority by developing a \"Yang family clique\". When Yang resisted the rise of Jiang Zemin (who had been the Party secretary of Shanghai), whom Deng began to groom to succeed him as paramount leader, party elders, including Deng himself forced Yang to retire in 1993, along with some of his family.[7]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Voice of America, before Yang Shangkun died in 1998, he allegedly told army doctor Jiang Yanyong that the crackdown on 4 June had been the most serious mistake committed by Li Peng and the Communist Party in its history, a mistake that Yang believed he could not correct, but which he believed would eventually be corrected.[10]\n\n\nYang died on 14 September 1998, aged 91. His official obituary described him as \"a great proletarian revolutionary, a statesman, a military strategist, a staunch Marxist, an outstanding leader of the party, the state, and the people's army.\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1929, he married Li Bozhao, a woman who participated in the Long March alongside Yang. They had three sons.[11]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Politics of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"族谱帮大忙，确定杨尚昆诞辰日为8月3日--中国共产党新闻--中国共产党新闻-人民网\".

He was a full member of the Politburo from 1956 to 1987, and of its Standing Committee from 1977 to 1987.[4][5]\n\n\nLi worked as an apprentice carpenter in his teenage years to support his family. He joined the Communist Party in December 1927 and became a soldier in the Chinese Red Army. After studying at the Military–Political University and the Central Party School, he became an influential and successful military commander during the Second Sino–Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, distinguishing himself in the Huai–Hai Campaign.[4] After the PRC was established, he served as Governor and Party Secretary of his native Hubei Province from 1949 to 1954, and then joined the central leadership in Beijing, serving as Minister of Finance (1954–1970) and Vice Premier (1954–1982). He supported Mao Zedong's designated successor, Hua Guofeng, and was named Vice Chairman of the Party (1977–1982).\n\n\nOne of the Eight Elders of the Communist Party, he was considered the most leftist among them, both politically and economically. Li played a key role in blocking privatizations and maintaining state control in many sectors of the economy, promoted classical Communist political and cultural values through his patronage of theorists such as Hu Qiaomu and Deng Liqun, and was instrumental in purging liberals Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. He enthusiastically advocated for the military suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Li in the People's Liberation Army during the Civil War (1946)\nBorn in Hong'an, Hubei, Li came from a poor family and spent his teenage years working at a carpenter's shop. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in December 1927, and served as an army captain and political commissar for the Chinese Red Army during the Long March. He was a military cadre in Zhang Guotao West Route Army.[6]: 476\n\n\nAfter arriving in Yan'an, he studied at the Counter-Japanese Military and Political University and at the Central Party School. Here he was under pressure, as other military cadres who served on the West Route Army. He fought in both the Second Sino–Japanese War, where he was sent to the Hubei-Henan Region to lead the guerrilla and establish an Anti-Japanse base area,[6]: 477 and the Chinese Civil War, especially in the Central Plains, and played a key role in many Communist victories, most significantly in the Huai–Hai Campaign.[4]\n\n\n\n### Mao-era China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Li with Nicolae Ceaușescu prior to the 30th anniversary of the liberation of Romania, 22 August 1974\nAfter the Communists' victory in China, Li was appointed Governor and Party Secretary of his native Hubei Province from 1949 to 1954, and he also served as the commander and political commissar of the province's military garrison. Additionally, he was Vice Chairman of the PRC's Military Commission for South–Central China (overseeing military and public security forces in Guangdong, Hainan, Henan, Hubei and Hunan).\n\n\nIn 1954, Li joined the central leadership in Beijing and became China's Minister of Finance. He was also appointed Vice Premier for the entire period of 1954–1982. \n\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Li was a part of the February Countercurrent which criticized the Cultural Revolution for creating social disorder and undermining China's leadership.[7]: 154 Despite losing his job as Finance Minister in 1970, he nonetheless enjoyed Zhou Enlai's protection and was the only civilian official to serve without interruption alongside Zhou throughout the 1966–1976 Cultural Revolution decade.[8]: xviii In 1976, Li played an instrumental role in destroying the Gang Of Four. After the demise of the Gang, Li was appointed Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and a member of the Central Military Commission.\n\n\n\n### Post-Mao politician[edit]\n\n\nWhen Chairman Hua Guofeng rose to leadership after the death of Mao Zedong, Li became Hua's chief economic adviser and one of his main backers, along with Generals Wang Dongxing and Chen Xilian. If Hua had been successful in his efforts to achieve supreme power, Li would have become one of the most powerful officials in China, but Li's political career stalled when Deng Xiaoping eclipsed Hua as China's \"Paramount leader\". For the rest of his career, Li complained that his own achievements during the brief Hua interregnum were not sufficiently recognized as the basis of the progress experienced in China during the 1980s.\n\n\nLi was described as an \"orthodox\" or \"Soviet-style\" communist and was a firm believer in central planning and sociopolitical conformity, so disliked Deng Xiaoping's more radical economic reform ideas. He had in fact been largely responsible for drafting the short-lived Ten Year Plan of 1978 which attempted to build a Soviet-style economy based around heavy industry and energy production. Li's ideas enjoyed strong support among some sections of the Chinese top leadership; General Yu Qiuli and his \"oil clique\", for example, fully supported Li.\n\n\nHowever, Deng quickly terminated these ideas and instituted his own \"go slow\" approach that involved gradually allowing the development of light industry and consumer goods.[8]: xviii[9] He also went about assigning government posts to younger men who were followers of his ideas. One of these was Premier Zhao Ziyang, whom Li strongly opposed for being too willing to import Western ideas and move away from a planned economy. According to Zhao, Li \"hated me because I was implementing Deng Xiaoping's reforms, but since it was difficult for him to openly oppose Deng, he made me the target of his opposition.\"[8]: xviii–xix\n\n\n\n### Presidency[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Li with his wife Lin Jiamei and Ronald Reagan (1985)\n![](image)Li as President, 1985\nIn 1983, after the passing of a new Constitution, Li was appointed President of China at the age of 74. Although according to the 1982 Constitution the role of President was \"largely ceremonial\", it recognized Li's status as a respected Party elder and a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, and Li himself went on to forcefully use his still very substantial influence to support leftist policies. In 1984, Li met with U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the latter's visit to China, notably discussing the status of Taiwan with the President.[10] Li visited the United States in July 1985, the first time the head of state of the People's Republic of China made such a visit.\n\n\nAs the decade progressed, Deng Xiaoping, always an opponent of lifetime tenure in office, gradually convinced most of the party elders to retire. Li stepped down as president in 1988 and was succeeded by Yang Shangkun. Li was then named Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC. He was a strong supporter of Jiang Zemin's rise to power,[*citation needed*] and during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Li was one of the hardline Party elders who pushed for a strong response to the demonstrations and supported Premier Li Peng's desire to use military force to suppress the protests.[5][11][12] Li continued to serve in government until his death in 1992.\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nLi had four children. His youngest daughter, Li Xiaolin, is the President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. She is a member of the CPPCC national committee.[13][14]\n\n\n\n## Death and later commemoration[edit]\n\n\nLi died on 21 June 1992 at the age of 82, two days shy of his 83rd birthday.[15] His funeral was held on 27 June 1992 and was attended by members of the Politburo Standing Committee. After the service, Li was cremated.[16]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Order of the Star of the Romanian Socialist Republic, 1st Class (Romania, 1984)[17]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rittenberg, Sidney; Bennett, Amanda (2001). *The Man Who Stayed Behind*.

He was a full member of the Politburo from 1956 to 1987, and of its Standing Committee from 1977 to 1987.[4][5]\n\n\nLi worked as an apprentice carpenter in his teenage years to support his family. He joined the Communist Party in December 1927 and became a soldier in the Chinese Red Army. After studying at the Military–Political University and the Central Party School, he became an influential and successful military commander during the Second Sino–Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, distinguishing himself in the Huai–Hai Campaign.[4] After the PRC was established, he served as Governor and Party Secretary of his native Hubei Province from 1949 to 1954, and then joined the central leadership in Beijing, serving as Minister of Finance (1954–1970) and Vice Premier (1954–1982). He supported Mao Zedong's designated successor, Hua Guofeng, and was named Vice Chairman of the Party (1977–1982).\n\n\nOne of the Eight Elders of the Communist Party, he was considered the most leftist among them, both politically and economically. Li played a key role in blocking privatizations and maintaining state control in many sectors of the economy, promoted classical Communist political and cultural values through his patronage of theorists such as Hu Qiaomu and Deng Liqun, and was instrumental in purging liberals Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. He enthusiastically advocated for the military suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Li in the People's Liberation Army during the Civil War (1946)\nBorn in Hong'an, Hubei, Li came from a poor family and spent his teenage years working at a carpenter's shop. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in December 1927, and served as an army captain and political commissar for the Chinese Red Army during the Long March. He was a military cadre in Zhang Guotao West Route Army.[6]: 476\n\n\nAfter arriving in Yan'an, he studied at the Counter-Japanese Military and Political University and at the Central Party School. Here he was under pressure, as other military cadres who served on the West Route Army. He fought in both the Second Sino–Japanese War, where he was sent to the Hubei-Henan Region to lead the guerrilla and establish an Anti-Japanse base area,[6]: 477 and the Chinese Civil War, especially in the Central Plains, and played a key role in many Communist victories, most significantly in the Huai–Hai Campaign.[4]\n\n\n\n### Mao-era China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Li with Nicolae Ceaușescu prior to the 30th anniversary of the liberation of Romania, 22 August 1974\nAfter the Communists' victory in China, Li was appointed Governor and Party Secretary of his native Hubei Province from 1949 to 1954, and he also served as the commander and political commissar of the province's military garrison. Additionally, he was Vice Chairman of the PRC's Military Commission for South–Central China (overseeing military and public security forces in Guangdong, Hainan, Henan, Hubei and Hunan).\n\n\nIn 1954, Li joined the central leadership in Beijing and became China's Minister of Finance. He was also appointed Vice Premier for the entire period of 1954–1982. \n\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Li was a part of the February Countercurrent which criticized the Cultural Revolution for creating social disorder and undermining China's leadership.[7]: 154 Despite losing his job as Finance Minister in 1970, he nonetheless enjoyed Zhou Enlai's protection and was the only civilian official to serve without interruption alongside Zhou throughout the 1966–1976 Cultural Revolution decade.[8]: xviii In 1976, Li played an instrumental role in destroying the Gang Of Four. After the demise of the Gang, Li was appointed Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and a member of the Central Military Commission.\n\n\n\n### Post-Mao politician[edit]\n\n\nWhen Chairman Hua Guofeng rose to leadership after the death of Mao Zedong, Li became Hua's chief economic adviser and one of his main backers, along with Generals Wang Dongxing and Chen Xilian. If Hua had been successful in his efforts to achieve supreme power, Li would have become one of the most powerful officials in China, but Li's political career stalled when Deng Xiaoping eclipsed Hua as China's \"Paramount leader\". For the rest of his career, Li complained that his own achievements during the brief Hua interregnum were not sufficiently recognized as the basis of the progress experienced in China during the 1980s.\n\n\nLi was described as an \"orthodox\" or \"Soviet-style\" communist and was a firm believer in central planning and sociopolitical conformity, so disliked Deng Xiaoping's more radical economic reform ideas. He had in fact been largely responsible for drafting the short-lived Ten Year Plan of 1978 which attempted to build a Soviet-style economy based around heavy industry and energy production. Li's ideas enjoyed strong support among some sections of the Chinese top leadership; General Yu Qiuli and his \"oil clique\", for example, fully supported Li.\n\n\nHowever, Deng quickly terminated these ideas and instituted his own \"go slow\" approach that involved gradually allowing the development of light industry and consumer goods.[8]: xviii[9] He also went about assigning government posts to younger men who were followers of his ideas. One of these was Premier Zhao Ziyang, whom Li strongly opposed for being too willing to import Western ideas and move away from a planned economy. According to Zhao, Li \"hated me because I was implementing Deng Xiaoping's reforms, but since it was difficult for him to openly oppose Deng, he made me the target of his opposition.\"[8]: xviii–xix\n\n\n\n### Presidency[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Li with his wife Lin Jiamei and Ronald Reagan (1985)\n![](image)Li as President, 1985\nIn 1983, after the passing of a new Constitution, Li was appointed President of China at the age of 74. Although according to the 1982 Constitution the role of President was \"largely ceremonial\", it recognized Li's status as a respected Party elder and a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, and Li himself went on to forcefully use his still very substantial influence to support leftist policies. In 1984, Li met with U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the latter's visit to China, notably discussing the status of Taiwan with the President.[10] Li visited the United States in July 1985, the first time the head of state of the People's Republic of China made such a visit.\n\n\nAs the decade progressed, Deng Xiaoping, always an opponent of lifetime tenure in office, gradually convinced most of the party elders to retire. Li stepped down as president in 1988 and was succeeded by Yang Shangkun. Li was then named Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC. He was a strong supporter of Jiang Zemin's rise to power,[*citation needed*] and during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Li was one of the hardline Party elders who pushed for a strong response to the demonstrations and supported Premier Li Peng's desire to use military force to suppress the protests.[5][11][12] Li continued to serve in government until his death in 1992.\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nLi had four children. His youngest daughter, Li Xiaolin, is the President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. She is a member of the CPPCC national committee.[13][14]\n\n\n\n## Death and later commemoration[edit]\n\n\nLi died on 21 June 1992 at the age of 82, two days shy of his 83rd birthday.[15] His funeral was held on 27 June 1992 and was attended by members of the Politburo Standing Committee. After the service, Li was cremated.[16]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Order of the Star of the Romanian Socialist Republic, 1st Class (Romania, 1984)[17]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rittenberg, Sidney; Bennett, Amanda (2001). *The Man Who Stayed Behind*.
