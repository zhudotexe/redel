Alston said the success of *That's So Raven* led to Disney Channel changing its approach to original programming. He praised the chemistry between Raven-Symoné, Brown and van der Pol, which he attributed to their real-life friendships. Alston cited the episodes \"A Goat's Tale\" and \"Out of Control\" as the ones that best represent this dynamic. Raven-Symoné was widely recognized for her charisma and physical comedy in the series; Massey's \"knack\" for physical comedy was also praised.[2][23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Gargoyles* (1994–1997)\n* *The Shnookums & Meat Funny Cartoon Show* (1995)\n* *The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa* (1995–1999)\n* *Flash Forward* (1995–1997)\n* *Quack Pack* (1996)\n* *Mighty Ducks* (1996–1997)\n* *Going Wild with Jeff Corwin* (1997–1999)\n* *101 Dalmatians: The Series* (1997–1998)\n* *The Ink and Paint Club* (1997–1998)\n* *Bug Juice* (1998–2001)\n* *Mad Libs* (1998–1999)\n* *Off the Wall* (1998–1999)\n* *Disney's Hercules: The Animated Series* (1998–1999)\n* *The Famous Jett Jackson* (1998–2001)\n* *So Weird* (1999–2001)\n* *The Jersey* (1999–2004)\n |\n| 2000s debuts | * *Totally Circus* (2000)\n* *Even Stevens* (2000–2003)\n* *In a Heartbeat* (2000–2001)\n* *Totally Hoops* (2001)\n* *Lizzie McGuire* (2001–2004)\n* *The Legend of Tarzan* (2001–2003)\n* *The Proud Family* (2001–2005)\n* *Kim Possible* (2002–2007)\n* *Totally in Tune* (2002)\n* *That's So Raven* (2003–2007)\n* *Lilo & Stitch: The Series* (2003–2006)\n* *Dave the Barbarian* (2004–2005)\n* *Phil of the Future* (2004–2006)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Dog with a Blog* (2012–2015)\n* *Wander Over Yonder* (2013–2016)\n* *Liv and Maddie* (2013–2017)\n* *Mickey Mouse* (2013–2019)\n* *I Didn't Do It* (2014–2015)\n* *Win, Lose or Draw* (2014)\n* *Girl Meets World* (2014–2017)\n* *K.C.

Alston said the success of *That's So Raven* led to Disney Channel changing its approach to original programming. He praised the chemistry between Raven-Symoné, Brown and van der Pol, which he attributed to their real-life friendships. Alston cited the episodes \"A Goat's Tale\" and \"Out of Control\" as the ones that best represent this dynamic. Raven-Symoné was widely recognized for her charisma and physical comedy in the series; Massey's \"knack\" for physical comedy was also praised.[2][23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Gargoyles* (1994–1997)\n* *The Shnookums & Meat Funny Cartoon Show* (1995)\n* *The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa* (1995–1999)\n* *Flash Forward* (1995–1997)\n* *Quack Pack* (1996)\n* *Mighty Ducks* (1996–1997)\n* *Going Wild with Jeff Corwin* (1997–1999)\n* *101 Dalmatians: The Series* (1997–1998)\n* *The Ink and Paint Club* (1997–1998)\n* *Bug Juice* (1998–2001)\n* *Mad Libs* (1998–1999)\n* *Off the Wall* (1998–1999)\n* *Disney's Hercules: The Animated Series* (1998–1999)\n* *The Famous Jett Jackson* (1998–2001)\n* *So Weird* (1999–2001)\n* *The Jersey* (1999–2004)\n |\n| 2000s debuts | * *Totally Circus* (2000)\n* *Even Stevens* (2000–2003)\n* *In a Heartbeat* (2000–2001)\n* *Totally Hoops* (2001)\n* *Lizzie McGuire* (2001–2004)\n* *The Legend of Tarzan* (2001–2003)\n* *The Proud Family* (2001–2005)\n* *Kim Possible* (2002–2007)\n* *Totally in Tune* (2002)\n* *That's So Raven* (2003–2007)\n* *Lilo & Stitch: The Series* (2003–2006)\n* *Dave the Barbarian* (2004–2005)\n* *Phil of the Future* (2004–2006)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Dog with a Blog* (2012–2015)\n* *Wander Over Yonder* (2013–2016)\n* *Liv and Maddie* (2013–2017)\n* *Mickey Mouse* (2013–2019)\n* *I Didn't Do It* (2014–2015)\n* *Win, Lose or Draw* (2014)\n* *Girl Meets World* (2014–2017)\n* *K.C.
