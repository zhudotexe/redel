Whether the mountain was climbed in ancient times is unknown. It may have been climbed in 1924, although this has never been confirmed, as neither of the men making the attempt returned. Several climbing routes have been established over several decades of climbing expeditions to the mountain.[87][88][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\nEverest's summit is first known to have been reached by a human in 1953, and interest from climbers increased thereafter.[89] Despite the effort and attention poured into expeditions, only about 200 people had summited by 1987.[89] Everest remained a difficult climb for decades, even for serious attempts by professional climbers and large national expeditions, which were the norm until the commercial era began in the 1990s.[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Khumbu Icefall in 2005\n![](image)The Western Cwm (\"Coom\"), with Everest on the left and Lhotse to the right\nBy the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals.[153] Some notable \"firsts\" by climbers include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy March 2012, Everest had been climbed 5,656 times with 223 deaths.[91] Although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs, Everest is so high the jet stream can hit it. Climbers can be faced with winds beyond 320 km/h (200 mph) when the weather shifts.[92] At certain times of the year the jet stream shifts north, providing periods of relative calm at the mountain.[93] Other dangers include blizzards and avalanches.[93]\n\n\nBy 2013, The Himalayan Database recorded 6,871 summits by 4,042 different people.[94]\n\n\n\n### Early attempts[edit]\n\n\nIn 1885, Clinton Thomas Dent, president of the Alpine Club, suggested that climbing Mount Everest was possible in his book *Above the Snow Line*.[95]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n89. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Mt.

It established a route through the Khumbu icefall and ascended to the South Col at an elevation of 7,986 m (26,201 ft). Raymond Lambert and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay were able to reach an elevation of about 8,595 m (28,199 ft) on the southeast ridge, setting a new climbing altitude record. Tenzing's experience was useful when he was hired to be part of the British expedition in 1953.[102] The Swiss decided to make another post-monsoon attempt in the autumn; they made it to the South Col but were driven back by winter winds and severe cold.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### First successful ascent by Tenzing and Hillary, 1953[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1953 British Mount Everest expedition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSacred Mountains of China\n |\n| --- |\n| Five Great Mountains | * Tai\n* Hua\n* Heng (Hunan)\n* Heng (Shanxi)\n* Song\n |\n| Four Sacred Chinese Buddhist Mountains | * Emei\n* Jiuhua\n* Putuo\n* Wutai\n |\n| Four Sacred Tibetan Buddhist Mountains | * Kawagarbo\n* Amne Machin\n* Rinpoche (Kailash)\n* Ghado Jobo\n |\n| Four Sacred Taoist Mountains | * Wudang\n* Longhu\n* Qiyun\n* Qingcheng\n |\n| Three Sacred Mountains | * Tian Shan\n* Changbai\n* Kunlun\n |\n| Three Famous Mountains | * Huang\n* Lushan\n* Yandang\n |\n| Five Garrison Mountains | * Yi\n* Wu\n* Kuaiji\n* Yiwulü\n* Huo\n |\n| Other Sacred Mountains | * Lao\n* Zhongnan\n* Gongga\n* Qomolangma (Everest)\n* Three Holy Peaks of Nyidên, Dabba (Yading)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSeven Summits\n |\n| --- |\n| Asia | * **Mount Everest** (8,848 m or 29,029 ft)\n |\n| South America | * **Aconcagua** (6,962 m or 22,841 ft)\n |\n| North America | * **Denali** (6,198 m or 20,335 ft)\n |\n| Africa | * **Mount Kilimanjaro** (5,893 m or 19,334 ft)\n |\n| Europe | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n105. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Norgay, Tenzing; Ramsey Ullman, James (1955). *Man of Everest: The Autobiography of Tenzing*. also published as *Tiger of the Snows*.

Team member Thomas Montgomerie designated the mountain \"K2\" for being the second peak of the Karakoram range. The other peaks were originally named K1, K3, K4, and K5, but were eventually renamed Masherbrum, Gasherbrum IV, Gasherbrum II, and Gasherbrum I, respectively.[37] In 1892, Martin Conway led a British expedition that reached \"Concordia\" on the Baltoro Glacier.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe standard route of ascent, used by 75% of all climbers, is the Abruzzi Spur,[102][103] located on the Pakistani side, first attempted by Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi in 1909. This is the peak's southeast ridge, rising above the Godwin-Austen Glacier. The spur proper begins at an altitude of 5,400 metres (17,700 ft), where Advanced Base Camp is usually placed. The route follows an alternating series of rock ribs, snow/ice fields, and some technical rock climbing on two famous features, \"House's Chimney\" and the \"Black Pyramid.\" Above the Black Pyramid, dangerously exposed and difficult-to-navigate slopes lead to the easily visible \"Shoulder\", and thence to the summit. The last major obstacle is a narrow couloir known as the \"Bottleneck\", which places climbers dangerously close to a wall of seracs that form an ice cliff to the east of the summit. It was partly due to the collapse of one of these seracs around 2001 that no climbers reached the summit in 2002 and 2003.[104]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first serious attempt to climb K2 was undertaken in 1902 by Oscar Eckenstein, Aleister Crowley, Jules Jacot-Guillarmod, Heinrich Pfannl, Victor Wessely, and Guy Knowles via the Northeast Ridge. In the early 1900s, modern transportation did not exist in the region: it took \"fourteen days just to reach the foot of the mountain\".[39]\nAfter five serious and costly attempts, the team reached 6,525 metres (21,407 ft)[40]—although considering the difficulty of the challenge, and the lack of modern climbing equipment or weatherproof fabrics, Crowley's statement that \"neither man nor beast was injured\" highlights the relative skill of the ascent. The failures were also attributed to sickness (Crowley was suffering the residual effects of malaria), a combination of questionable physical training, personality conflicts, and poor weather conditions—of 68 days spent on K2 (at the time, the record for the longest time spent at such an altitude) only eight provided clear weather.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Kashmir\", *Encyclopedia Americana*, Scholastic Library Publishing, 2006, p. 328, ISBN 978-0-7172-0139-6, KASHMIR, kash'mer, the northernmost region of the Indian subcontinent, administered partly by India, partly by Pakistan, and partly by China.

The north side is the steepest: there it rises over 3,200 metres (10,500 ft) above the K2 (Qogir) Glacier in only 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) of horizontal distance.
