He also attributed the decline to increased competition, a global economic downturn and \"ads signal loss\".[85] Plans to lay off a further 10,000 employees began in April 2023.[86] The layoffs were part of a general downturn in the technology industry, alongside layoffs by companies including Google, Amazon, Tesla, Snap, Twitter and Lyft.[87][88]\n\n\nMeta revenue surpassed analyst expectations for the first quarter of 2023 after announcing that it was increasing its focus on AI.[89] On July 6, 2023, Meta launched a new app, Threads, a competitor to Twitter.[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFacebook opened its London headquarters in 2017 in Fitzrovia in central London.
