Between 2004 and 2022, Lopez received a total of 12 awards. Lopez is the first Filipino and Asian to achieve this feat. He is also the youngest winner to receive all four awards in competitive categories, as well as the fastest to complete his qualifying run of EGOT award wins (9 years, 8 months). Lopez is the first (and to date only) person to win each EGOT award twice, a \"double EGOT\".[16][17] Since his second series of wins would independently qualify Lopez for EGOT status, he has broken his own 'fastest to complete' record, establishing a new fastest interval at 7 year, 8 months (June 27th, 2010 Emmy through March 4th, 2018 Academy Award). \n\n\nHis initial Emmy prizes were Daytime Emmys, eventually winning a Primetime Emmy in 2021 for *WandaVision*. He is the second EGOT recipient (after John Legend) to follow a Daytime Emmy win with a subsequent Primetime Emmy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Awards are presided over by industry bodies based in the United States, and as of 2023, 14 out of the 18 EGOT winners were American nationals. The remaining four ― John Gielgud, Audrey Hepburn, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Tim Rice ― were British. Many countries hold their own equivalent awards ceremonies honouring their own television, music, film, and theatre industries. In some cases, commentators in other countries have derived their own acronyms for individuals who have won at all four ceremonies.\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Leah Collins of CBC Arts proposed a Canadian equivalent of the EGOT: the Canadian Screen Awards (and their predecessors, the Gemini and Genie Awards) for film and television, the Juno Awards for music, and the Dora Mavor Moore Awards for theatre.[40] Toronto-based game show Trivia Club referred to this combination as the \"Two-Can-Ju-Do\".[41] No individual has won in all four categories.\n\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Name\n | Emmy\n | Grammy\n | Oscar\n | Tony\n | EGOT completed\n | Year span\n | Age at completion\n | Category(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Richard Rodgers | 1962\n | 1960[n 1] | 1946\n | 1950[n 1][n 2] | 1962\n | 16\n | 59 years, 10 months\n | Composer, producer\n |\n| Helen Hayes[n 3] | 1953\n | 1977\n | 1932[n 1] | 1947[n 1][n 2] | 1977\n | 45\n | 76 years, 4 months\n | Actress\n |\n| Rita Moreno[n 3] | 1977[n 1] | 1972\n | 1962\n | 1975\n | 1977\n | 15\n | 45 years, 9 months\n | Actress, singer, dancer\n |\n| John Gielgud | 1991\n | 1979\n | 1982\n | 1961[n 1],[n 2] | 1991\n | 29\n | 87 years, 4 months\n | Actor, director\n |\n| Audrey Hepburn | 1993[n 4] | 1994[n 4] | 1954[n 2] | 1954[n 2] | 1994\n | 40\n | 63 years, 8 months[n 4] | Actress\n |\n| Marvin Hamlisch | 1995[n 1] | 1974[n 1] | 1974[n 1] | 1976\n | 1995\n | 21\n | 51 years, 3 months\n | Composer\n |\n| Jonathan Tunick | 1982\n | 1988\n | 1978\n | 1997\n | 1997\n | 19\n | 59 years, 1 month\n | Orchestrator, music arranger, composer, conductor\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)In 2018, John Legend became the fifteenth person to win all four awards, the first African American man,[19] and first to have won both competitive Primetime and Daytime Emmy Awards.\nAmerican singer, songwriter, pianist, and record producer John Legend (born 1978) received his fourth distinct award in 2018. Between 2006 and 2022, Legend received a total of 18 awards. Legend has won the most Grammy Awards, 12, of any EGOT recipient. In addition to being the first black man to achieve EGOT status,[20] Legend is the first person to receive the four awards in four consecutive years.[21] He was also the first EGOT recipient to have won both a competitive Primetime and Daytime Emmy Award, an accomplishment matched by Robert Lopez in 2021.
