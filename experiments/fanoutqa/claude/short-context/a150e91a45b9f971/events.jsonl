It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as **Apple Computer, Inc.** in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called \"1984\". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Apple 10-K Report FY2021\" (PDF).

Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[258] According to a 2011 report in *Fortune*, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[259] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching *Star Trek* and attending *Star Trek* conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[260]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n202. **^** Fisher, Anne (March 17, 2008). \"America's Most Admired Companies\". *Fortune*.

It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made several corporate acquisitions, the largest being the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in October 2023,[3] followed by its acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[4] and its acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n180. **^** \"Microsoft Surpasses Exxon as 2nd Most Valuable Co\".

Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[258] According to a 2011 report in *Fortune*, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[259] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching *Star Trek* and attending *Star Trek* conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[260]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n297. **^** La Monica, Paul R.
