All soft landings took place on the near side of the Moon until 3 January 2019, when the Chinese Chang'e 4 spacecraft made the first landing on the far side of the Moon.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Uncrewed landings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stamp with a drawing of the first soft landed probe Luna 9, next to the first view of the lunar surface photographed by the probe\nSix national space agencies (Interkosmos, NASA, CNSA, ISRO, JAXA and the European Space Agency) have reached the moon with uncrewed missions that achieved varying degrees of success, as well as two private/commercial missions from Israel and Japan. The Soviet Union (Interkosmos), the United States (NASA), China (CNSA) and India (ISRO) are the only four nations to have successfully achieved soft landings.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwo organizations have attempted but failed to achieve soft landings: Israeli private space agency SpaceIL with their Beresheet spacecraft, and Japanese company ispace's Hakuto-R Mission 1.\n\n\nOn August 23, 2023, ISRO successfully landed its Chandrayaan-3 module at the lunar south pole, making India the fourth nation to successfully complete a soft landing on the Moon.[7] Chandrayaan-3 saw a successful soft landing of its *Vikram* lander and *Pragyan* rover at 6.04pm IST (1234 GMT), marking the first uncrewed soft landing in the little-explored region.[8]\n\n\n\n## Crewed landings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Apollo program\n\nSee also: List of people who have walked on the Moon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing their initial hard landings on the Moon, sixteen Soviet, U.S., Chinese and Indian spacecraft have used braking rockets (retrorockets) to make soft landings and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface. In 1966 the Soviet Union accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the Luna 9 and Luna 13 missions. The U.S. followed with five Surveyor soft landings. China's ongoing  \"Chang'e\" program has landed 3 times since 2013, achieving soil sample return and the first landing on the far side of the Moon.\n\n\nThe Soviet Union achieved the first uncrewed lunar soil sample return with Luna 16 on 24 September 1970. Luna 17 was the first successful uncrewed lunar rover mission, in 1970. China's Chang'e 4 made the first uncrewed soft landing on the far side of the Moon on 3 January 2019.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nArrival of a spacecraft on the Moon's surface\n\nThis article is about the general topic of landing on the Moon.

Except for the Apollo program, all soft landings were uncrewed.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon approach of the target moon, a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity. In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about 160 kilometres per hour (99 mph) and be ruggedized to withstand a \"hard landing\" impact, or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a \"soft landing\" (the only option for humans). The first three attempts by the U.S. to perform a successful hard Moon landing with a ruggedized seismometer package in 1962 all failed.[9] The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966, followed only months later by the first uncrewed soft lunar landing by the U.S.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Soviet Union performed the first hard Moon landing – \"hard\" meaning the spacecraft intentionally crashes into the Moon at high speeds – with the Luna 2 spacecraft in 1959, a feat the U.S. duplicated in 1962 with Ranger 4. \n\n\nMore recently, other space programs have made intentional hard landings, sometimes with end-of-life lunar orbiters that could no longer maintain their orbits. Japan's lunar orbiter Hiten impacted the Moon's surface on 10 April 1993. The European Space Agency performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter SMART-1 on 3 September 2006. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) performed a controlled crash impact with its Moon Impact Probe (MIP) on 14 November 2008. The Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1 executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWithin four months of each other in early 1966 the Soviet Union and the United States had accomplished successful Moon landings with uncrewed spacecraft. To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming crewed landers with their much greater weight.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a 50-kilometre-per-hour (31 mph) ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned 160-kilometre-per-hour (99 mph) impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a crewed flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Model of Luna 16 Moon soil sample return lander\n![](image)Model of Soviet Lunokhod automatic Moon rover\nThe Luna 9 spacecraft, launched by the Soviet Union, performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February 1966. Airbags protected its 99 kilograms (218 lb) ejectable capsule which survived an impact speed of over 15 metres per second (54 km/h; 34 mph).[25] Luna 13 duplicated this feat with a similar Moon landing on 24 December 1966. Both returned panoramic photographs that were the first views from the lunar surface.[26]\n\n\nLuna 16 was the first robotic probe to land on the Moon and safely return a sample of lunar soil back to Earth.[27] It represented the first lunar sample return mission by the Soviet Union, and was the third lunar sample return mission overall, following the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. This mission was later successfully repeated by Luna 20 (1972) and Luna 24 (1976).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, Lunar Module pilot of the first lunar landing mission, poses for a photograph beside the deployed United States flag during an Apollo 11 Extravehicular Activity (EVA) on the lunar surface.\nIn total, twenty-four U.S. astronauts have traveled to the Moon. Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of free return trajectory; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of crewed Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut Alan Bean is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.[30]\n\n\n\n### Human Moon landings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Russia's first attempt to reach the Moon since 1976, and since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Luna 25 spacecraft failed during \"pre-landing\" maneuvers, and crashed into the lunar surface on August 19, 2023.[73]\n\n\n\n### Chandrayaan 3 (India)[edit]\n\n\n![Vikram lander of Chandrayaan-3 near lunar south pole](image)Vikram lander of Chandrayaan-3 near lunar south pole\nIndia's national space agency ISRO launched Chandrayaan-3 on 14 July 2023. Chandrayaan-3 consists of an Indigenous Lander Module (LM), Propulsion module (PM) and the *Pragyan* rover. The lander with the rover successfully landed near the lunar south pole at 18:04 IST on 23 August 2023.[74][75]\n\n\n\n## Landings on moons of other Solar System bodies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the Moon in 1959.[11] Crash landings[12] may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft, or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket. There have been many such Moon crashes, often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface. For example, during the Apollo program the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the Lunar Module were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a moonquake on seismometers that had been left on the lunar surface. Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the internal structure of the Moon.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A timeline of the space race between 1957 and 1975, with missions from the US and USSR\nAdvances in other areas were necessary before crewed spacecraft could follow uncrewed ones to the surface of the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all flew directly to the surface without a lunar orbit. Such direct ascents use a minimum amount of fuel for uncrewed spacecraft on a one-way trip.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 28 October 1974\n | Sample return\n | Failure – Moon landing achieved, but malfunction prevented sample return\n | Mare Crisium\n | 012.00N 062.00E\n |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 16 October 1975\n | Sample return\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n| Luna-24 | 5,800\n | Proton\n | 9 August 1976\n | Sample return\n | Success – returned 0.17 kg of Moon soil back to Earth\n | Mare Crisium\n | 012.25N 062.20E\n |\n\n\n## U.S. uncrewed soft landings (1966–1968)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLADEE was launched on 7 September 2013.[49] The mission ended on 18 April 2014, when the spacecraft's controllers intentionally crashed LADEE into the far side of the Moon,[50][51] which, later, was determined to be near the eastern rim of Sundman V crater.[52][53]\n\n\n\n### Manfred Memorial Moon Mission (Luxemburg)[edit]\n\n\nThe Manfred Memorial Moon Mission was launched on the 23 October 2014. It conducted a lunar flyby and operated for 19 days which was four times longer than expected. The Manfred Memorial Moon Mission remained attached to the upper stage of its launch vehicle (CZ-3C/E). The spacecraft along with its upper stage impacted the Moon on 4 March 2022.[54][55][56]\n\n\n\n## 21st century uncrewed soft landings and attempts[edit]\n\n\n### Chang'e 3 (China)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The view through the window of the Lunar Module *Orion* shortly after Apollo 16's landing\nA total of twelve men have landed on the Moon. This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a Lunar Module on each of six NASA missions across a 41-month period starting 20 July 1969, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11, and ending on 14 December 1972 with Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt on Apollo 17. Cernan was the last man to step off the lunar surface.\n\n\nAll Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the command module. The last three missions included a drivable lunar rover, the Lunar Roving Vehicle, for increased mobility.\n\n\n\n## Scientific background[edit]\n\n\nTo get to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave Earth's gravity well; currently, the only practical means is a rocket. Unlike airborne vehicles such as balloons and jets, a rocket can continue accelerating in the vacuum outside the atmosphere.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Still frame from a video transmission, taken moments before Neil Armstrong became the first human to step onto the surface of the Moon, at 02:56 UTC on 21 July 1969.

This includes both crewed and robotic missions. The first human-made object to touch the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2, on 13 September 1959.[3]\n\n\nThe United States' Apollo 11 was the first crewed mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969.[4] There were six crewed U.S. landings between 1969 and 1972, and numerous uncrewed landings, with no soft landings happening between 22 August 1976 and 14 December 2013.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Manned Space Chronology: Apollo\\_11\". spaceline.org.

Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The Apollo 8 mission carried out the first human trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the Saturn V booster for crewed use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. Apollo 10 then performed a full dress rehearsal of a crewed Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within 47,400 feet (14.4 km) of the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module too heavy to land. With the failure of the robotic Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt Luna 15 in July 1969, the stage was set for Apollo 11.\n\n\n\n## Human Moon landings (1969–1972)[edit]\n\n\n### US strategy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Landing\n | Failure – lunar flyby at 160,000 kilometres (99,000 mi)\n |\n| Luna-7 | 1504\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 4 October 1965\n | Landing\n | Failure – lunar impact\n |\n| Luna-8 | 1550\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 3 December 1965\n | Landing\n | Failure – lunar impact during landing attempt\n |\n\n\n## Early U.S. uncrewed lunar missions (1958–1965)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **is written like a personal reflection, personal essay, or argumentative essay** that states a Wikipedia editor's personal feelings or presents an original argument about a topic.

After that the IMR gradually decreased and by 1989 it had fallen to 22.7, which was lower than had been reported in any previous year (though close to the figure of 22.9 in 1971).[13] In 1989, the IMR ranged from a low of 11.1 in the Latvian SSR to a high of 54.7 in the Turkmen SSR.[14]\n\n\nResearch conducted after the dissolution of the Soviet Union revealed that the originally reported mortality rates vary substantially underestimated the actual rates, especially for infant mortality. This has been shown for Transcaucasian and Central Asian republics.[15][16]\n\n\nAfter two decades of declining and stagnating fertility rates, the Soviet TFR rose from 2.27 in 1978-79 to 2.51 in 1986-87. Most Muslim areas of the USSR continued to fall, while non-Muslim regions rose slightly.[17]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Population pyramid of the Soviet Union in 1989\nAccording to data from the 1989 Soviet census, the population of the USSR was made up of 70% East Slavs, 17% Turkic peoples, and less than 2% other ethnic groups. Alongside the atheist majority of 60%, there were sizable minorities of Russian Orthodox Christians (approximately 20%) and Muslims (approximately 15%).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Revolution and Civil war, 1917 - 1923[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of the Soviet Union in 1926\nDuring the Russian Revolution and Civil War period, Russia lost territories of the former Russian Empire, whose populations totalled about 30 million people (Poland: 18 million; Finland: 3 million; Romania: 3 million; the Baltic states: 5 million, Kars: 400 thousand). At least 2 million citizens of the former Russian Empire died during the Russian Civil War of 1917–1923, and a further 1 to 2 million emigrated.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Interwar period, 1924 to 1940[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* 24 deaths/1,000 live births (1990)\n\n\n### Life expectancy at birth[edit]\n\n\n* 65 years male, 74 years female (1990)\n\n\n### Total fertility rate[edit]\n\n\n* 2.4 children born/woman (1985)\n* 2.528 children born/woman (1987)\n* 2.26 children born/woman (1990)\n\n\n### Nationality[edit]\n\n\n* noun - Soviet(s); adjective - Soviet\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\n* 99.8% (1980)[22]\n\n\n### Labor force[edit]\n\n\nLabor force: 152,300,000 civilians; 80% industry and other nonagricultural fields, 20% agriculture; shortage of skilled labor (1989)\n\n\nOrganized labor: 98% of workers were union members; all trade unions were organized within the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (AUCCTU) and conducted their work under the guidance of the Communist party. There was a market relationship between the people and the state as the employer; people were free to choose their job and leave if they wished, although members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union could be ordered to work in certain places, but seldom were.[23]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Aanderson, Barbara A.

At least 2 million citizens of the former Russian Empire died in the course of the Russian Civil War of 1917–1923, and a further 1 to 2 million emigrated. An estimated 800,000 to 1,200,000 people died during the purges of the 1930s.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to the Russian Academy of Sciences the Soviet Union suffered 26.6 million deaths (1941-1945) during World War II, including an increase in infant mortality of 1.3 million.

According to research professors Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, Soviet fertility was both high and low. The national rate stood at 2.8 children per woman in 1958-59 before falling to 2.4 in 1969-70 and 2.3 in 1978-79.[33] The total fertility for ethnic Russian women within the RSFSR declined from 2.4 to 1.8 in the late 1960s and 1970s. The same trend could be found in the Baltic and Western regions of the USSR, which each of the Soviet republics' titular nationality approaching sub-replacement fertility. Caucasian ethnic groups, such as Armenians and Georgians followed the same trend, but on average had more children than Soviet citizens living in Russia, the Baltic states, Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOverall Soviet citizens spoke more than 200 languages and dialects (at least 18 with more than 1 million speakers); Slavic group: 75%, other Indo-European: 8%, Altaic: 12%, Uralic: 3%, Caucasian: 2% (1990 est.)[21]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Demographics of Central Asia\n* Religion in the Soviet Union\n* Family in the Soviet Union\n* List of Russian censuses\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01YBWoRrRYFttiG5F1GA1zND","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It determined the resident population of the United States to be 248,709,873, an increase of 9.8 percent over the 226,545,805 persons enumerated during the 1980 census.[1]\n\n\nApproximately 16 percent of households received a \"long form\" of the 1990 census, which contained more than 100 questions. Full documentation on the 1990 census, including census forms and a procedural history, is available from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series.\n\n\nIt was the first census to designate \"Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander\" as a racial group separate from Asians.\n\n\nTo increase black participation in the 1990 United States census, the bureau recruited Bill Cosby, Magic Johnson, Alfre Woodard, and Miss America Debbye Turner as spokespeople.[2] The Integrated Public Use Microdata Series.

As of the 2020 census, Los Angeles has remained the nation's second-largest city.\n\n\n\n\n## State rankings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map showing the population change of each US State by

Representatives starting with the 1992 elections. Consequently, this affected the number of votes each state has in the Electoral College for the 1992 presidential election.\n\n\nBecause of population changes, twenty-one states had changes in their number of seats. Eight states gained at least one seat, and thirteen states lost at least one seat. The final result involved 19 seats being switched.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Gained seven seats | Gained four seats | Gained three seats | Gained one seat | Lost one seat | Lost two seats | Lost three seats\n

After that the IMR gradually decreased and by 1989 it had fallen to 22.7, which was lower than had been reported in any previous year (though close to the figure of 22.9 in 1971).[13] In 1989, the IMR ranged from a low of 11.1 in the Latvian SSR to a high of 54.7 in the Turkmen SSR.[14]\n\n\nResearch conducted after the dissolution of the Soviet Union revealed that the originally reported mortality rates vary substantially underestimated the actual rates, especially for infant mortality. This has been shown for Transcaucasian and Central Asian republics.[15][16]\n\n\nAfter two decades of declining and stagnating fertility rates, the Soviet TFR rose from 2.27 in 1978-79 to 2.51 in 1986-87. Most Muslim areas of the USSR continued to fall, while non-Muslim regions rose slightly.[17]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Population pyramid of the Soviet Union in 1989\nAccording to data from the 1989 Soviet census, the population of the USSR was made up of 70% East Slavs, 17% Turkic peoples, and less than 2% other ethnic groups. Alongside the atheist majority of 60%, there were sizable minorities of Russian Orthodox Christians (approximately 20%) and Muslims (approximately 15%).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Revolution and Civil war, 1917 - 1923[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of the Soviet Union in 1926\nDuring the Russian Revolution and Civil War period, Russia lost territories of the former Russian Empire, whose populations totalled about 30 million people (Poland: 18 million; Finland: 3 million; Romania: 3 million; the Baltic states: 5 million, Kars: 400 thousand). At least 2 million citizens of the former Russian Empire died during the Russian Civil War of 1917–1923, and a further 1 to 2 million emigrated.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Interwar period, 1924 to 1940[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* 24 deaths/1,000 live births (1990)\n\n\n### Life expectancy at birth[edit]\n\n\n* 65 years male, 74 years female (1990)\n\n\n### Total fertility rate[edit]\n\n\n* 2.4 children born/woman (1985)\n* 2.528 children born/woman (1987)\n* 2.26 children born/woman (1990)\n\n\n### Nationality[edit]\n\n\n* noun - Soviet(s); adjective - Soviet\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\n* 99.8% (1980)[22]\n\n\n### Labor force[edit]\n\n\nLabor force: 152,300,000 civilians; 80% industry and other nonagricultural fields, 20% agriculture; shortage of skilled labor (1989)\n\n\nOrganized labor: 98% of workers were union members; all trade unions were organized within the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (AUCCTU) and conducted their work under the guidance of the Communist party.

According to research professors Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, Soviet fertility was both high and low. The national rate stood at 2.8 children per woman in 1958-59 before falling to 2.4 in 1969-70 and 2.3 in 1978-79.[33] The total fertility for ethnic Russian women within the RSFSR declined from 2.4 to 1.8 in the late 1960s and 1970s. The same trend could be found in the Baltic and Western regions of the USSR, which each of the Soviet republics' titular nationality approaching sub-replacement fertility. Caucasian ethnic groups, such as Armenians and Georgians followed the same trend, but on average had more children than Soviet citizens living in Russia, the Baltic states, Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^**  http://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/ussr\\_nac\\_26.php. `{{cite web}}`: Missing or empty `|title=` (help)\n27. **^** \"Демоскоп Weekly - Приложение.

In 1987, the government announced that the fourth national census would take place in 1990 and that there would be one every ten years thereafter. The 1982 census (which reported a total population of 1,008,180,738) is generally accepted as significantly more reliable, accurate, and thorough than the previous two.[15] Various international organizations eagerly assisted the Chinese in conducting the 1982 census, including the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, which donated US$100.0 million between 1980-1989 for a variety of projects, one of which being the 1982 census.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"Tough road ahead for China census\". *Straitstimes.com*.

It was by far the most thorough and accurate census taken since 1949 and confirmed that China was a nation of more than 1 billion people, or about one-fifth of the world's population. The census provided demographers with a set of data on China's age-sex structure, fertility and mortality rates, and population density and distribution. Information was also gathered on minority ethnic groups, urban population, and marital status. For the first time since the People's Republic of China was founded, demographers had reliable information on the size and composition of the Chinese work force. The nation began preparing for the 1982 census in late 1976. Chinese census workers were sent to the United States and Japan to study modern census-taking techniques and automation. Computers were installed in every provincial-level unit except Tibet and were connected to a central processing system in the Beijing headquarters of the State Statistical Bureau. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Historical population[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Population history of China\n\n![](image)Historical population in China from 400 BC[13]\n![](image)Historical population of India and China since 1100 with projection to 2100\nDuring 1960–2015, the population grew to nearly 1.4 billion. Under Mao Zedong, China nearly doubled in population from 540 million in 1949 to 969 million in 1979. This growth slowed because of the one-child policy instituted in 1979.[13] The 2022 data shows a declining population for the first time since 1961.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of China from 1950 to 2022\n![](image)Age structure projections for China up to 2100\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

After an eighteen-year gap, population specialists were given a wealth of reliable, up-to-date figures on which to reconstruct past demographic patterns, measure current population conditions, and predict future population trends. For example, Chinese and foreign demographers used the 1982 census age-sex structure as the base population for forecasting and making assumptions about future fertility trends. The data on age-specific fertility and mortality rates provided the necessary base-line information for making population projections. The census data also were useful for estimating future manpower potential, consumer needs, and utility, energy, and health-service requirements. The sudden abundance of demographic data helped population specialists immeasurably in their efforts to estimate world population. Previously, there had been no accurate information on these 21% of the Earth's inhabitants. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAge structure\n![](image)Age pyramid for China.

After that the IMR gradually decreased and by 1989 it had fallen to 22.7, which was lower than had been reported in any previous year (though close to the figure of 22.9 in 1971).[13] In 1989, the IMR ranged from a low of 11.1 in the Latvian SSR to a high of 54.7 in the Turkmen SSR.[14]\n\n\nResearch conducted after the dissolution of the Soviet Union revealed that the originally reported mortality rates vary substantially underestimated the actual rates, especially for infant mortality.

According to research professors Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, Soviet fertility was both high and low. The national rate stood at 2.8 children per woman in 1958-59 before falling to 2.4 in 1969-70 and 2.3 in 1978-79.[33] The total fertility for ethnic Russian women within the RSFSR declined from 2.4 to 1.8 in the late 1960s and 1970s. The same trend could be found in the Baltic and Western regions of the USSR, which each of the Soviet republics' titular nationality approaching sub-replacement fertility. Caucasian ethnic groups, such as Armenians and Georgians followed the same trend, but on average had more children than Soviet citizens living in Russia, the Baltic states, Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA newborn Soviet child in 1926–27 had a life expectancy of 44.4 years, up from 32.3 years in the Russian Empire thirty years before.

By 1959, 54.6% of Soviet citizens were recorded as ethnic Russians. At first, this was due to the incorporation of new territories westward in Europe after World War II, such as the Polish Eastern Borderlands, the Baltic states, Carpathian Ruthenia, and Bessarabia. This resulted in an increase of non-Russian ethnic groups, especially those who were Belarusian, Ukrainian, Polish, Moldovan, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian. However, starting in the 1960s, the decline of the Russian majority was mainly driven by indigenous ethnic groups residing in the Caucasian and Central Asian Soviet republics. For example, the five main Central Asian groups, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tajiks, and Turkmens, together saw a 163.81% increase from 1959 to 1989. Azerbaijanis, the largest Muslim group in the Soviet Caucasus, grew from 2.9 million people to almost 6.8 million during the same time, which represents a 130.31% increase. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOverall, the mentioned ethnicities had an average total fertility rate between 1.8 and 2.3 by 1978-79.[34] In contrast, Soviet Muslim women had much higher fertility rates. In 1969-70, the average Muslim woman had 7 children, which represents an increase from 6.2 in 1958-59. Despite decreasing to 5.6 in 1978-79 and further falling in the 1980s, the birth rate amongst Soviet Muslims remained consistently higher than those who were non-Muslims.[35]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in the Soviet Union\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![Soviet Union urban and rural population density map 1982](image)\n\nSoviet Union urban and rural population density map 1982\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOther ethnic groups included Abkhaz, Adyghes, Aleuts, Assyrians, Avars, Bulgarians, Buryats, Chechens, Chinese, Cossacks, Crimean Tatars, Evenks, Finns, Gagauz, Greeks, Hungarians, Ingushes, Inuit, Kalmyks, Karakalpaks, Karelians, Kets, Koreans, Lezgins, Maris, Mongols, Nenetses, Ossetians, Roma, Romanians, Tats, Tuvans, Udmurts, and Yakuts.

According to the 1939 census, Russians reached a peak of 58.4% of the population.[32] Previously in 1926, Russians were 52.9% of the population. This could be due to the decrease of Ukrainians, which coincides with the Holodomor. \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01YYSJ4DAST4z4Zc6NwUcb69","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

In 1987, the government announced that the fourth national census would take place in 1990 and that there would be one every ten years thereafter. The 1982 census (which reported a total population of 1,008,180,738) is generally accepted as significantly more reliable, accurate, and thorough than the previous two.[15] Various international organizations eagerly assisted the Chinese in conducting the 1982 census, including the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, which donated US$100.0 million between 1980-1989 for a variety of projects, one of which being the 1982 census.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChina was the world's most populous country from at least 1950 until being surpassed by India in 2023.[5][6]\n\n\nAs of December 2022, China's population stood at 1.4118 billion.[7] According to the 2020 census, 91.11% of the population was Han Chinese, and 8.89% were minorities. China's population growth rate is only 0.03%, ranking 159th in the world.[8] China conducted its sixth national population census in 2010,[9][10] and its seventh census was completed in late 2020, with data released in May 2021.[11] Unless otherwise indicated, the statistics on this page pertain to mainland China only; see also Demographics of Hong Kong, Demographics of Macau and Demographics of Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Chinese history\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

According to the Ministry of Health and Family Planning November 2015 announcement, China's 2015 Total Fertility Rate or TFR was somewhere between 1.5 and 1.6.[24][25]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChina was the world's most populous nation for many centuries, until being surpassed by India in 2023.[17] When China took its first post-1949 census in 1953, the population stood at 583 million; by the fifth census in 2000, the population had more than doubled, reaching 1.2 billion.\n\n\nBy the sixth census in 2020, the total population had reached to 1,419,933,142, with the mainland having 1,411,778,724, Hong Kong having 7,474,200, and Macau having 683,218. However, this number is disputed by obstetrics researcher Yi Fuxian, who argues that data related to population growth is inflated by local governments to obtain financial subsidies from the central government.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Population of China by age and sex (demographic pyramid)[edit]\n\n\n* ![China population pyramid as of 1st National Census day on June 30, 1953](image)\n\nChina population pyramid as of 1st National Census day on June 30, 1953\n* ![China population pyramid as of 2nd National Census day on July 1, 1964](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** \"UNSD — Demographic and Social Statistics\".\n27. **^** \"World Population Prospects – Population Division – United Nations\".

It was by far the most thorough and accurate census taken since 1949 and confirmed that China was a nation of more than 1 billion people, or about one-fifth of the world's population. The census provided demographers with a set of data on China's age-sex structure, fertility and mortality rates, and population density and distribution. Information was also gathered on minority ethnic groups, urban population, and marital status. For the first time since the People's Republic of China was founded, demographers had reliable information on the size and composition of the Chinese work force. The nation began preparing for the 1982 census in late 1976. Chinese census workers were sent to the United States and Japan to study modern census-taking techniques and automation. Computers were installed in every provincial-level unit except Tibet and were connected to a central processing system in the Beijing headquarters of the State Statistical Bureau. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"Tough road ahead for China census\". *Straitstimes.com*.

After an eighteen-year gap, population specialists were given a wealth of reliable, up-to-date figures on which to reconstruct past demographic patterns, measure current population conditions, and predict future population trends. For example, Chinese and foreign demographers used the 1982 census age-sex structure as the base population for forecasting and making assumptions about future fertility trends. The data on age-specific fertility and mortality rates provided the necessary base-line information for making population projections. The census data also were useful for estimating future manpower potential, consumer needs, and utility, energy, and health-service requirements. The sudden abundance of demographic data helped population specialists immeasurably in their efforts to estimate world population. Previously, there had been no accurate information on these 21% of the Earth's inhabitants. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region\n | 1,506,200\n | 0.26\n | 2,107,500\n | 0.30\n | 3,895,578\n | 0.39\n | 4,655,451\n | 0.41\n | 5,620,000\n | 0.44\n | 6,301,350\n | 0.47\n | 7,202,654\n | 0.51\n |\n| Qinghai | 1,676,534\n | 0.29\n | 2,145,604\n | 0.31\n | 3,895,706\n | 0.39\n | 4,456,946\n | 0.39\n | 5,180,000\n | 0.41\n | 5,626,722\n | 0.42\n | 5,923,957\n | 0.42\n |\n| Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\n | 4,873,608\n | 0.84\n | 7,270,067\n | 1.05\n | 13,081,681\n | 1.30\n | 15,155,778\n | 1.34\n | 19,250,000\n | 1.52\n | 21,813,334\n | 1.63\n | 25,852,345\n | 1.83\n |\n| Military personnel\n |  |  |  |  | 4,238,210\n |  | 3,199,100\n |  | 2,500,000\n |  | 2,300,000\n |  | 2,000,000\n |  |\n| Population with permanent residence difficult to define\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 4,649,985\n |  |\n| Total China\n | 582,603,417\n | 694,581,759\n | 1,008,175,288\n | 1,133,682,501\n | 1,265,830,000\n | 1,339,724,852\n | 1,411,778,724\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01Bk2Cz2BHPMxsTpzjwGHL7T","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
