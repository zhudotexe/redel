These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990.

A research article on dog genomics published in Science/AAAS defines modern dog breeds as \"a recent invention defined by conformation to a physical ideal and purity of lineage\".[1]\n\n\nAccording to BigThink, over 40% of the world’s dog breeds come from the United Kingdom, France and Germany. It states: \"Great Britain and France are the ground zero of dog fancying, with 57 registered breeds each. Germany is not far behind, with 47 breeds. These three countries alone represent more than 40% of all dog breeds recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.\"[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Extant breeds, varieties and types[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Note:** not all dogs listed below are recognized breeds by an official breed registry that can certify the dog is a purebred, including The Kennel Club (TKC - 1873), the oldest and first official dog breed registry in the world, located in the United Kingdom,[3] and the three oldest breed registries in North America, and largest in the world, including the American Kennel Club (AKC - 1884),[4][5] United Kennel Club (UKC - 1898),[6] and Canadian Kennel Club (CKC - 1888).[7]\n\n\n\n### A–C[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDogs\n |\n| --- |\n| Types | * African village dogs\n* Feral dogs\n\t+ Pye-dogs\n\t+ Street dogs\n* Hairless dogs\n* Herding dogs\n\t+ Collies\n\t+ Livestock guardian dogs\n\t+ Sheepdogs\n* Hunting dogs\n\t+ Curs\n\t\t- Feists\n\t\t- Lurchers\n\t+ Gun dogs\n\t\t- Pointers\n\t\t- Retrievers\n\t\t- Setters\n\t\t- Spaniels\n\t\t- Water dogs\n\t+ Hounds\n\t\t- Scenthounds\n\t\t\t* Bassets\n\t\t\t* Coonhounds\n\t\t\t* Foxhounds\n\t\t- Sighthounds\n\t\t\t* Longdogs\n\t+ Terriers\n\t\t- Bull-type terriers\n\t\t- Pinschers\n\t\t- Schnauzers\n* Mastiffs\n\t+ Bulldogs\n* Spitz\n\t+ Huskies\n\t+ Laikas\n\t+ Tugous\n* Toy dogs\n\t+ Bichons\n* Turnspit dogs\n |\n| Breeds | * List of breeds\n* List of crossbreeds\n* Mixed-breed dogs\n* Crossbreeds\n* Extinct breeds\n* Most popular\n |\n| Roles | * Assistance dogs\n\t+ Autism dogs\n\t+ Guide dogs\n\t+ Hearing dogs\n\t+ Medical response dogs\n\t\t- Seizure dogs\n\t+ Mobility assistance dogs\n\t+ Therapy dogs\n\t\t- Psychiatric service dogs\n* Attack dogs\n* Bay dogs\n* Carriage dogs\n* Catch dogs\n* Companion dogs\n* Detection dogs\n* Fighting dogs\n* Guard dogs\n* Lap dogs\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Meat dogs\n* Mercy dogs\n* Pet dogs\n* Police dogs\n\t+ usage by country\n* Search and rescue dogs\n* Sled dogs\n* War dogs\n |\n| Behavior | * Communication\n\t+ Barking\n\t+ Howling\n* Human–canine bond\n* Intelligence\n* Dog–cat relationship\n |\n| Human–doginteraction | * Animal testing\n* Baiting\n* Breed-specific legislation\n* Dog bite\n* Dog fighting\n* Dog park\n* Dog show\n* Human–canine bond\n* Dog sports\n* Dog walking\n* Dog daycare\n* Dog grooming\n* Therapy\n* Fear of dogs\n* Dog licence\n* Dog meat\n* Dog food\n\t+ dog biscuit\n\t+ 2007 recalls\n* Dogs in religion\n* Dogs in space\n* Origin of the domestic dog\n |\n| Health | * Aging (List of longest-living dogs)\n* Anatomy\n* Breeding\n* Coat\n* Conformation\n* Diseases\n* Dog food\n* Odor\n* Rabies in animals\n* Rage syndrome\n* Reproduction\n* Skin disorders\n* Vaccination\n |\n| Training | * Clicker\n* Crate training\n* Training\n* Housebreaking\n* Socialization\n |\n| Related | * List of individual dogs\n* List of fictional dogs\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Portal\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Dachshund[121]\n* Dalmatian[122]\n* Dandie Dinmont Terrier[123]\n* Danish Spitz\n* Danish–Swedish Farmdog[124]\n* Denmark Feist[125]\n* Dikkulak[126]\n* Dingo [note 1]\n* Dobermann[50]\n* Dogo Argentino[128]\n* Dogo Sardesco\n* Dogue Brasileiro[128]\n* Dogue de Bordeaux[129]\n* Donggyeongi\n* Drentse Patrijshond[130]\n* Drever[131]\n* Dunker[132]\n* Dutch Shepherd[133]\n* Dutch Smoushond[134]\n* East Siberian Laika[135]\n* East European Shepherd[136]\n* Ecuadorian Hairless Dog[137]\n* English Cocker Spaniel[138]\n* English Foxhound[139]\n* English Mastiff[129]\n* English Setter[140]\n* English Shepherd[141]\n* English Springer Spaniel[142]\n* English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan)[143]\n* Entlebucher Mountain Dog[144]\n* Erbi Txakur\n* Estonian Hound[145]\n* Estrela Mountain Dog[99]\n* Eurasier[115]\n* Faroese Sheepdog\n* Field Spaniel[146]\n* Fila Brasileiro[128]\n* Finnish Hound[147]\n* Finnish Lapphund[148]\n* Finnish Spitz[149]\n* Flat-coated Retriever[150]\n* French Bulldog[151]\n* French Spaniel[152]\n* Galgo Español[153]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Volpino Italiano[232]\n* Weimaraner[271]\n* Welsh Hound\n* Welsh Sheepdog\n* Welsh Springer Spaniel[142]\n* Welsh Terrier[193]\n* West Country Harrier[272]\n* West Highland White Terrier[219]\n* West Siberian Laika[189]\n* Westphalian Dachsbracke[131]\n* Wetterhoun[233]\n* Whippet[207]\n* White Shepherd\n* White Swiss Shepherd Dog[69]\n* Wire Fox Terrier[256]\n* Wirehaired Pointing Griffon[273]\n* Wirehaired Vizsla\n* Xiasi Dog\n* Xoloitzcuintle[274]\n* Yakutian Laika\n* Yorkshire Terrier[275]\n* Zerdava\n\n## Extinct and Critically Endangered breeds, varieties and types[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Reznik, Allan (15 June 2020). \"What Are the Differences Between the AKC, CKC and UKC Registries? – Dogster\". *Dogster*.
