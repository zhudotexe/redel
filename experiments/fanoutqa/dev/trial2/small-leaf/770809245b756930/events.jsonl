The most recent to join the list were Leicester City (2015–16 champions) and before that, Nottingham Forest (1977–78) and Derby County (1971–72).\n\n\nFive teams have won the league title three seasons in a row: Huddersfield Town (1924–1926), Arsenal (1933–1935), Liverpool (1982–1984), Manchester United twice (1999–2001 & 2007–2009) and Manchester City (2021–2023).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeven teams have at some point held first or joint first place in the number of titles won: Preston North End (1889–1895), Sunderland (1893–1899 and 1936–1953), Aston Villa (1897–1953), Arsenal (1948–1976), Liverpool (1966–1971 and 1973–2011), Manchester United (1967–1971 and 2009–) and Everton (1970–1971).\n\n\nEight teams have finished as runners up without ever finishing top: Bristol City (1906–07), Oldham Athletic (1914–15), Cardiff City (1923–24), Charlton Athletic (1936–37), Blackpool (1955–56), Queens Park Rangers (1975–76), Watford (1982–83) and Southampton (1983–84). Of these, Cardiff City came closest to winning the league, matching champions Huddersfield Town in points but losing out on goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded), the precursor to goal difference.\n\n\nTeams in **bold** compete in the Premier League as of the 2023–24 season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nManchester United have won twenty titles,[11] the most of any club.[12] United's rivals Liverpool are second with nineteen. Liverpool dominated during the 1970s and 1980s (winning eleven league titles between 1973 and 1990), while Manchester United dominated in the 1990s and 2000s under manager Sir Alex Ferguson (eleven league titles between 1993\nand 2009). Arsenal are third with thirteen titles, having dominated during the 1930s (five league titles between 1931 and 1938). Everton and Manchester City are joint-fourth with nine titles, of which seven of City's have been won in the 2010s and 2020s. Aston Villa (seven) and Sunderland (six) secured the majority of their titles before the 1920s. Chelsea (six) won the majority of their titles in the 21st century (between 2005 and 2017).\n\n\nHuddersfield Town, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City are the only sides to have won the league title in three consecutive seasons; no team has been crowned champion four seasons in a row.[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about men's English football league champions.

This resulted in a shift of power towards bigger clubs.[7] Financial considerations became an even bigger influence from 1992, when the teams then in the First Division defected to form the FA Premier League. This supplanted the Football League First Division as the highest level of football in England,[8] and due to a series of progressively larger television contracts, put unprecedented wealth into the hands of top flight clubs.[9] The first five champions in the Premier League era – Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United – had all won the title at least once prior to 1992. Leicester City were champions for the first time in 2016, becoming the first team to win the Premier League without having previously won the First Division. Other than inaugural league champions Preston North End, Ipswich Town remain the only club to win the top flight division at their first ever attempt.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| City /

It was not until 1931 that a Southern club were crowned champions, when Herbert Chapman's Arsenal secured the title.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![Scotland](image) Alex Ferguson |\n| 2000–01 |

In 1925 the club signed Dixie Dean from Tranmere Rovers. In 1927–28, Dean set the record for top-flight league goals in a single season with 60 goals in 39 league games, which is a record that still stands. He helped Everton win their third League Championship that season.[10] However, Everton were relegated to the Second Division two years later during internal turmoil at the club. The club quickly rebounded and were promoted at the first attempt, while scoring a record number of goals in the Second Division. On return to the top flight in 1931–32, Everton wasted no time in reaffirming their status and won a fourth League Championship at the first opportunity.[11][12] Everton also won their second FA Cup in 1933 with a 3–0 win against Manchester City in the final. The era ended in 1938–39 with a fifth League Championship.[13][14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n157. **^** \"Everton Football Team 1986 – Everybody's Cheering The Blues\".

The late centre half and former captain Brian Labone comes in second with 534 matches. The longest serving player is goalkeeper Ted Sagar, who played for 23 years between 1929 and 1953. This tenure covered both sides of the Second World War and included a total of 495 appearances. Southall also previously held the record for the most league clean sheets during a season with 15. However, this record was beaten during the 2008–09 season by American goalkeeper Tim Howard, who ended the season with 17 clean sheets.[127] The club's top goalscorer, with 383 goals in all competitions, is Dixie Dean; the second-highest goalscorer is Graeme Sharp with 159. Dean still holds the English national record of most goals in a season with 60.[128]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe club's current manager is Sean Dyche.[125] There have also been four caretaker managers, and before 1939 the team was selected by either the club secretary or by committee. The club's longest-serving manager has been Harry Catterick, who was in charge of the team from 1961 to 1973 for 594 first team matches.[126] The Everton manager to win the most domestic and international trophies is Howard Kendall, who won two First Division championships, the 1984 FA Cup, the 1985 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, and three FA Charity Shields.\n\n\n\n## Records and statistics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Everton F.C. records and statistics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Premier League Handbook 2020/21\" (PDF).

They are one of six teams to have played in every season of the Premier League since its inception in August 1992 – the others being Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur.

Remarkably, there was only one injury at this game, which occurred when Tom Fleetwood was hit on the head by a coin thrown from the crowd whilst he marched around the perimeter and played the cornet with St Edward's Orphanage Band. Goodison Park, like all major English football grounds since the recommendations of the Taylor Report were implemented, is now an all-seater and only holds just under 40,000, meaning it is unlikely that this attendance record will ever be broken at Goodison.[128] Everton's record transfer paid was to Swansea City for the Icelandic midfielder Gylfi Sigurðsson for a sum of £45m in 2017.[129] The sale of Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United the same year was for an initial sum of £75m, the largest sum Everton has received for a player and then the largest transfer between two English clubs.[130]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Finishing positions in the top flight between 1955 and 2011\nEverton's second successful era started when Harry Catterick was made manager in 1961.

The club's first game was a 1–0 victory over Everton Church Club.[6] The club was renamed Everton in November 1879 after the local area, as people outside the congregation wished to participate.[6][7]\n\n\nThe club was a founding member of the Football League in 1888–89 and won their first League Championship title in the 1890–91 season. Everton won the FA Cup for the first time in 1906 and the League Championship again in 1914–15. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 interrupted the football programme while Everton were reigning champions, which was something that would again occur in 1939.[8][9]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Away colours**\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n**Third colours**\n |\n\n |\n|  |\n| ![](image) *Current season* |\n\n\n**Everton Football Club** (/ˈɛvərtən/) is an English professional association football club based in Liverpool that competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football.

With Arsenal he lifted the Premier League title, both the major domestic cup competitions, and the European Cup Winners Cup.[4] Known for his speed, agility, finishing and aggression,[5] he played 581 league games, scoring 287 goals for seven clubs in Scotland and England, while also earning 33 caps for the England national team, and scoring nine international goals.[4]\n\n\nWright also played in the Premier League for West Ham United, the Scottish Premier League for Celtic and the Football League for Burnley and Nottingham Forest. As of 2023[update], he is Arsenal's second-highest scorer of all time and Crystal Palace's third-highest.[6][7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| FW | * ![Argentina](image) Agüero\n* ![Netherlands](image) Bergkamp\n* ![France](image) Cantona\n* ![England](image) An.
