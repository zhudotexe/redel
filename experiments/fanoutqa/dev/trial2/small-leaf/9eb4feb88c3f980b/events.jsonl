Coming up with *The Writing's on the Wall*, they released it on July 27, 1999, and it eventually became their breakthrough album.[20] *The Writing's on the Wall* peaked at number five on the *Billboard* 200 and number two on R&B chart in early 2000.[18] \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" was released in 1999 as the album's lead single and reached the top spot of the *Billboard* Hot 100, becoming their first US number-one single.[8] *The Writing's on the Wall* has been credited as Destiny's Child's breakthrough album, spurring their career and introducing them to a wider audience.[13][21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThree years after the hiatus, members of Destiny's Child reunited to record their fourth and final studio album, *Destiny Fulfilled*.[8] The album introduces the trio to a harder, \"urban\" sound, and songs featured are conceptually interrelated.[55] *Destiny Fulfilled* saw equality in the trio:[20] each member contributed to writing on the majority songs,[56] as well as becoming executive producers aside from their manager.[57] Released on November 15, 2004, *Destiny Fulfilled* failed to top *Survivor*; the album reached number two the following week, selling 497,000 copies in its first week, compared to 663,000 for the previous album.[58] Certified three-time platinum in the United States,[19] it was still one of the best-selling albums of 2005, selling over eight million copies worldwide;[48] it pushed the group back into the position of the best-selling female group and American group of the year. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDestiny's Child has sold more than 60 million records as of 2013[update].[3] *Billboard* ranks the group as one of the greatest musical trios of all time,[4] the ninth most successful artist/band of the 2000s,[5] placed the group 68th in its All-Time Hot 100 Artists list in 2008[6] and in December 2016, the magazine ranked them as the 90th most successful dance club artist of all time.[7] The group was nominated for 14 Grammy Awards, winning twice for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and once for Best R&B Song.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1990–1997: Early beginnings and Girl's Tyme[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Destiny's Child** was an American musical girl group whose final line-up comprised Beyoncé Knowles, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams. The group began their musical career as **Girl's Tyme**, formed in 1990 in Houston, Texas.[1] After years of limited success, the original quartet comprising Knowles, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett were signed in 1997 to Columbia Records as Destiny's Child. The group was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of the song \"No, No, No\" and their best-selling second album, *The Writing's on the Wall* (1999), which contained the number-one singles \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" and \"Say My Name\". Despite critical and commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict and legal turmoil, as Roberson and Luckett attempted to split from the group's manager Mathew Knowles, citing favoritism of Knowles and Rowland.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Destiny's Child's Long Road To Fame (The Song Isn't Called 'Survivor' For Nothing)\".

Group members have claimed that the name was taken from a passage in the Bible: \"We got the word destiny out of the Bible, but we couldn't trademark the name, so we added child, which is like a rebirth of destiny,\" said Knowles.[15] The word *Destiny* was stated to have been chosen from the Book of Isaiah, by Tina Knowles.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** Vineyard, Jennifer (December 5, 2001). \"Destiny's Child, R.

The song became a global commercial success and the group's third US *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one single. Retitling the album *Survivor* in reference to the turmoil surrounding their line-up alterations, Destiny's Child enlisted producers such as Anthony Dent, Damon Elliott, Mark J. Feist, Rob Fusari and Keybeats alongside Beyoncé, who produced all and co-wrote nearly all of the album's tracks. Their final product was an R&B and pop record incorporating genres such as dance, funk and hip hop. Its lyrical themes explore dynamics between women, self-esteem, independence and romantic relationships.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe recording sessions for *Survivor* commenced in May 2000 at the SugarHill Recording Studios in Houston, where most of the album was recorded. \"Gospel Medley\", which Destiny's Child had previewed during several public appearances throughout 2000,[11] was also recorded there;[12] the group decided to record it due to their longtime affinity for gospel.[13] As on the group's previous records, their manager Mathew Knowles served as the executive producer.[14] Initial tracks recorded for the album were in the vein of \"Jumpin', Jumpin'\", which was released as the fourth and final single from *The Writing's on the Wall* within that period, to tremendous commercial success. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Survivor* produced four singles. Its title track peaked at number two on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 and reached the top ten in 18 additional countries. In 2002, it won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. \"Bootylicious\" became Destiny's Child's fourth US *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one single and attained international success. \"Emotion\" became a US *Billboard* Hot 100 top-ten hit in the wake of the September 11 attacks, while \"Nasty Girl\" was released only overseas and achieved moderate success. The album was further promoted with the co-headlining Total Request Live Tour (2001) and the Destiny's Child World Tour (2002). After the latter's conclusion, the group embarked on a two-year hiatus, during which each member released a solo studio album to varying levels of success.\n\n\n\n\n## Background and development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOriginally titled *Independent Women* after \"Independent Women Part I\", the album was later retitled *Survivors*, as Destiny's Child branded themselves \"survivors\" in reference to the turmoil that had coincided with the group throughout 2000.[28] The title was later altered to *Survivor*. Beyoncé further explained: \"I thought about this joke that this radio station had, and they were saying, 'Oh, Destiny's Child is like \"Survivor,\" trying to see which member is going to last the longest on the island,' and everyone laughed. I was like, 'Ah, that's cute, but you know what? I'm going to use that negative thing and turn it into a positive thing and try to write a great song out of it.'\"[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the United States, *Survivor* debuted atop the *Billboard* 200 chart dated May 19, 2001, with first-week sales of 663,000 units.[107] It also debuted atop the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, selling over 87,000 copies at the R&B core stores within its first week.[108] Destiny's Child's first number-one album on both charts, it registered the highest first-week sales for any Columbia Records artist at the time.[109] Despite a 46% sales decline to 358,979 units, the album remained at the summit in its second week, reaching the one-million sales mark.[110] In its third week, the album descended to number three, selling 221,884 copies; in total, it spent 14 consecutive weeks within the top ten.[111][112] By the end of 2001, *Survivor* had sold over 3.7 million copies, becoming the seventh best-selling album of the year.[113] It was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 7, 2002.[114] By November 2005, the album had sold over 4.7 million units in the US, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon its release, *Survivor* received generally positive reviews, mostly aimed at its production, while its balladry, length and lyrical content ignited criticism. Retrospective critical commentaries have credited the record for its impact on mainstream music of the 2000s and for serving as foundation for Beyoncé's solo career. A global commercial success, the album debuted atop the US *Billboard* 200 with first-week sales of 663,000 units, becoming Destiny's Child's first number-one album on the chart. It has gone on to be certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 44th Annual Grammy Awards (2002), the album was nominated for Best R&B Album.

It was released on November 16, 2004, by Columbia Records and Sony Urban Music. Following the conclusion of promotional activities for their globally successful third studio album *Survivor* (2001), Destiny's Child embarked on a two-year hiatus, during which each member released solo albums to varying levels of success. They reunited in the summer of 2004 to record *Destiny Fulfilled*, primarily at the Sony Music Studios in New York City. Unlike the group's previous recordings, the album saw each member equally contributing to the songwriting and production, drawing inspiration from the events in their lives while being apart.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* \"Columbia Records/Sony Urban Music/Music World Music Moves Street Date of New Destiny's Child Album, Destiny Fulfilled, up to Monday, November 15\" (Press release).
