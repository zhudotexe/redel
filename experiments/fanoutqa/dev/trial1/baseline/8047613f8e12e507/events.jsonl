This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA *World Factbook* and its previous iterations against the information for United States in *Encyclopædia Britannica*, particularly its footnote section.[13] In sum, according to older versions of the CIA *World Factbook* (from 1982 to 1996), the U.S. was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610 km2 (3,618,780 sq mi). However, in the 1997 edition, the U.S. added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091 km2 (3,717,813 sq mi)). And then again in 2007, U.S. added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517 km2 (3,796,742 sq mi)).

In March 2014, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping \"declared war\" on pollution during the opening of the National People's Congress.[186] In 2020, Xi announced that China aims to peak emissions before 2030 and go carbon-neutral by 2060 in accordance with the Paris Agreement,[187] which, according to Climate Action Tracker, if accomplished it would lower the expected rise in global temperature by 0.2 – 0.3 degrees – \"the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker\".[187] In September 2021 Xi Jinping announced that China will not build \"coal-fired power projects abroad\".

The chairman of the CMC is the commander-in-chief of the PLA, with the officeholder also generally being the CCP general secretary, making them the paramount leader of China.[303]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n515. **^** \"In Education, China Takes the Lead\". *The New York Times*. 16 January 2013.

However, such pathway still leads to 3 degree temperature rise.[158] Official government statistics about Chinese agricultural productivity are considered unreliable, due to exaggeration of production at subsidiary government levels.[159][160] Much of China has a climate very suitable for agriculture and the country has been the world's largest producer of rice, wheat, tomatoes, eggplant, grapes, watermelon, spinach, and many other crops.[161]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n293. **^** \"China\". *Global Slavery Index*. 2016.

As of 2020[update], 58.42 percent of secondary school graduates were enrolled in higher education.[512] Vocational education is available to students at the secondary and tertiary level.[511] More than 10 million Chinese students graduated from vocational colleges nationwide every year.[513]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMuch of current Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on Premier Zhou Enlai's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and is also driven by the concept of \"harmony without uniformity\", which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences.[235] This policy may have led China to support or maintain close ties with states that are regarded as dangerous or repressive by Western nations, such as Myanmar,[236] North Korea and Iran.[237] China has a close political, economic and military relationship with Russia,[238] and the two states often vote in unison in the United Nations Security Council.[239][240][241]\n\n\n\n#### Trade relations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBoard games such as go (known as *wéiqí* in Chinese), xiangqi, mahjong, and more recently chess, are also played at a professional level.[625] In addition, China is home to a huge number of cyclists, with an estimated 470 million bicycles as of 2012[update].[450] Many more traditional sports, such as dragon boat racing, Mongolian-style wrestling and horse racing are also popular.[626]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough some criticisms of government policies and the ruling CCP are tolerated, censorship of political speech and information are amongst the harshest in the world and routinely used to prevent collective action.[278] China also has the most comprehensive and sophisticated Internet censorship regime in the world, with numerous websites being blocked.[279] The government suppresses popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to \"social stability\", as was the case with the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.[280] China additionally uses a massive espionage network of cameras, facial recognition software, sensors, and surveillance of personal technology as a means of social control of persons living in the country.[281]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe territory of China lies between latitudes 18° and 54° N, and longitudes 73° and 135° E.

China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory. In the east, along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains, while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad grasslands predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the deltas of China's two major rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Other major rivers include the Xi, Mekong, Brahmaputra and Amur. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the Taklamakan and the Gobi Desert. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChina's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, is famed for having united the Warring States' walls to form the Great Wall of China.

The incumbent president is Xi Jinping, who is also the general secretary of the CCP and the chairman of the Central Military Commission, making him China's paramount leader. The premier is the head of government, with Li Qiang being the incumbent premier. The premier is officially nominated by the president and then elected by the NPC, and has generally been either the second or third-ranking member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC). The premier presides over the State Council, China's cabinet, composed of four vice premiers, state councilors, and the heads of ministries and commissions.[200] The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is a political advisory body that is critical in China's \"united front\" system, which aims to gather non-CCP voices to support the CCP. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n541. **^** \"Obesity Sickening China's Young Hearts\". 4 August 2000. *People's Daily*.

This makes China one of the world's last countries governed by a communist party.

Han involvement in Central Asia and Sogdia helped establish the land route of the Silk Road, replacing the earlier path over the Himalayas to India. Han China gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world.[58] Despite the Han's initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the Qin philosophy of Legalism in favor of Confucianism, Qin's legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the Han government and its successors.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent, and which was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago.\nChina has one of the oldest sporting cultures in the world.

Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BCE) constituted the earliest Chinese writing system.[41]\n\n\n\n### Early dynastic rule[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe region that is now China has been inhabited since the Paleolithic era. The earliest Chinese dynastic states, such as the Shang and the Zhou, emerged in the basin of the Yellow River before the late second millennium BCE. The eighth to third centuries BCE saw a breakdown in Zhou authority and significant conflict, as well as the emergence of Classical Chinese literature and philosophy. In 221 BCE, China was unified under an emperor for the first time, ushering in more than two millennia in which China was governed by one or more imperial dynasties, including the Han, Tang, Ming and Qing. Some of China's most notable achievements—such as the invention of gunpowder and paper, the establishment of the Silk Road, and the building of the Great Wall—occurred during this period. The Chinese culture—including languages, traditions, architecture, philosophy and more—has heavily influenced East Asia during this imperial period.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween the 10th and 11th century CE, the population of China doubled in size to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song dynasty also saw a revival of Confucianism, in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang,[68] and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts, as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity.[69][70] However, the military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jurchen Jin dynasty. In 1127, Emperor Huizong of Song and the capital Bianjing were captured during the Jin–Song Wars. The remnants of the Song retreated to southern China.[71]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 1 October 1949, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong formally proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China at the new nation's founding ceremony and inaugural military parade in Tiananmen Square, Beijing.[111] In 1950, the People's Liberation Army captured Hainan from the ROC[112] and annexed Tibet.[113] However, remaining Kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western China throughout the 1950s.[114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the 2007–08 financial crisis, Chinese authorities sought to actively wean off of its dependence on the U.S. dollar as a result of perceived weaknesses of the international monetary system.[369] To achieve those ends, China took a series of actions to further the internationalization of the Renminbi. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe situation of human rights in China has attracted significant criticism from a number of foreign governments, foreign press agencies, and non-governmental organizations, alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial, forced confessions, torture, restrictions of fundamental rights, and excessive use of the death penalty.[206][274] Since its inception, Freedom House has ranked China as \"not free\" in its *Freedom in the World* survey,[206] while Amnesty International has documented significant human rights abuses.[274] The Constitution of the People's Republic of China states that the \"fundamental rights\" of citizens include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, universal suffrage, and property rights. However, in practice, these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state.[275][276] China has limited protections regarding LGBT rights.[277]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Lihaozhai High School in Jianshui, Yunnan.

In 2009, the government began a 3-year large-scale healthcare provision initiative worth US$124 billion.[530] By 2011, the campaign resulted in 95% of China's population having basic health insurance coverage.[531] By 2022, China had established itself as a key producer and exporter of pharmaceuticals, with the country alone producing around 40 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients in 2017.[532]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n553. **^** Yin 殷, Haishan 海山; Li 李, Yaozong 耀宗; Guo 郭, Jie 洁, eds.

Chinese rap, Chinese hip hop and Hong Kong hip hop have become popular in contemporary times.[610]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChinese cuisine is highly diverse, drawing on several millennia of culinary history and geographical variety, in which the most influential are known as the \"Eight Major Cuisines\", including Sichuan, Cantonese, Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Hunan, Anhui, and Zhejiang cuisines.[593] Chinese cuisine is also known for its width of cooking methods and ingredients,[594] as well as food therapy that is emphasized by traditional Chinese medicine.[595][*better source needed*] Generally, China's staple food is rice in the south, wheat-based breads and noodles in the north. The diet of the common people in pre-modern times was largely grain and simple vegetables, with meat reserved for special occasions. The bean products, such as tofu and soy milk, remain as a popular source of protein. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe word \"China\" has been used in English since the 16th century; however, it was not a word used by the Chinese themselves during this period. Its origin has been traced through Portuguese, Malay, and Persian back to the Sanskrit word *Cīna*, used in ancient India.[16] \"China\" appears in Richard Eden's 1555 translation[o] of the 1516 journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa.[p][16] Barbosa's usage was derived from Persian *Chīn* (چین), which was in turn derived from Sanskrit *Cīna* (चीन).[21] *Cīna* was first used in early Hindu scripture, including the *Mahābhārata* (5th century BCE) and the *Laws of Manu* (2nd century BCE).[22] In 1655, Martino Martini suggested that the word China is derived ultimately from the name of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE).[23][22] Although usage in Indian sources precedes this dynasty, this derivation is still given in various sources.[24] The origin of the Sanskrit word is a matter of debate, according to the *Oxford English Dictionary*.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n190. **^** Grantham, H.

King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty. He enacted Qin's legalist reforms throughout China, notably the forced standardization of Chinese characters, measurements, road widths (i.e., the cart axles' length), and currency. His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi, Guangdong, and Northern Vietnam.[54] The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death, as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion.[55][56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Mongol conquest of China began in 1205 with the gradual conquest of Western Xia by Genghis Khan,[72] who also invaded Jin territories.[73] In 1271, the Mongol leader Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty, which conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty in 1279. Before the Mongol invasion, the population of Song China was 120 million citizens; this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300.[74] A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang led a rebellion that overthrew the Yuan in 1368 and founded the Ming dynasty as the Hongwu Emperor. Under the Ming dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that admiral Zheng He led the Ming treasure voyages throughout the Indian Ocean, reaching as far as East Africa.[75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nScholars note that in China there is no clear boundary between three teachings religions and local folk religious practice.[559] A 2015 poll conducted by Gallup International found that 61% of Chinese people self-identified as \"convinced atheist\",[566] though Chinese religions or some of their strands are definable as non-theistic and humanistic religions, since they do not believe that divine creativity is completely transcendent, but it is inherent in the world and in particular in the human being.[567] According to a 2014 study, approximately 74% are either non-religious or practice Chinese folk belief, 16% are Buddhists, 2% are Christians, 1% are Muslims, and 8% adhere to other religions including Taoists and folk salvationism.[568] In addition to Han people's local religious practices, there are also various ethnic minority groups in China who maintain their traditional autochthone religions. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_1sCxjZLhmZWSy34SpHfbAsX1","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA *World Factbook* and its previous iterations against the information for United States in *Encyclopædia Britannica*, particularly its footnote section.[13] In sum, according to older versions of the CIA *World Factbook* (from 1982 to 1996), the U.S. was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610 km2 (3,618,780 sq mi). However, in the 1997 edition, the U.S. added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091 km2 (3,717,813 sq mi)). And then again in 2007, U.S. added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517 km2 (3,796,742 sq mi)).

In March 2014, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping \"declared war\" on pollution during the opening of the National People's Congress.[186] In 2020, Xi announced that China aims to peak emissions before 2030 and go carbon-neutral by 2060 in accordance with the Paris Agreement,[187] which, according to Climate Action Tracker, if accomplished it would lower the expected rise in global temperature by 0.2 – 0.3 degrees – \"the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker\".[187] In September 2021 Xi Jinping announced that China will not build \"coal-fired power projects abroad\".

The chairman of the CMC is the commander-in-chief of the PLA, with the officeholder also generally being the CCP general secretary, making them the paramount leader of China.[303]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n515. **^** \"In Education, China Takes the Lead\". *The New York Times*. 16 January 2013.

However, such pathway still leads to 3 degree temperature rise.[158] Official government statistics about Chinese agricultural productivity are considered unreliable, due to exaggeration of production at subsidiary government levels.[159][160] Much of China has a climate very suitable for agriculture and the country has been the world's largest producer of rice, wheat, tomatoes, eggplant, grapes, watermelon, spinach, and many other crops.[161]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n293. **^** \"China\". *Global Slavery Index*. 2016.

As of 2020[update], 58.42 percent of secondary school graduates were enrolled in higher education.[512] Vocational education is available to students at the secondary and tertiary level.[511] More than 10 million Chinese students graduated from vocational colleges nationwide every year.[513]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMuch of current Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on Premier Zhou Enlai's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and is also driven by the concept of \"harmony without uniformity\", which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences.[235] This policy may have led China to support or maintain close ties with states that are regarded as dangerous or repressive by Western nations, such as Myanmar,[236] North Korea and Iran.[237] China has a close political, economic and military relationship with Russia,[238] and the two states often vote in unison in the United Nations Security Council.[239][240][241]\n\n\n\n#### Trade relations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBoard games such as go (known as *wéiqí* in Chinese), xiangqi, mahjong, and more recently chess, are also played at a professional level.[625] In addition, China is home to a huge number of cyclists, with an estimated 470 million bicycles as of 2012[update].[450] Many more traditional sports, such as dragon boat racing, Mongolian-style wrestling and horse racing are also popular.[626]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough some criticisms of government policies and the ruling CCP are tolerated, censorship of political speech and information are amongst the harshest in the world and routinely used to prevent collective action.[278] China also has the most comprehensive and sophisticated Internet censorship regime in the world, with numerous websites being blocked.[279] The government suppresses popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to \"social stability\", as was the case with the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.[280] China additionally uses a massive espionage network of cameras, facial recognition software, sensors, and surveillance of personal technology as a means of social control of persons living in the country.[281]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe territory of China lies between latitudes 18° and 54° N, and longitudes 73° and 135° E.

China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory. In the east, along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains, while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad grasslands predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the deltas of China's two major rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Other major rivers include the Xi, Mekong, Brahmaputra and Amur. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the Taklamakan and the Gobi Desert. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChina's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, is famed for having united the Warring States' walls to form the Great Wall of China.

The incumbent president is Xi Jinping, who is also the general secretary of the CCP and the chairman of the Central Military Commission, making him China's paramount leader. The premier is the head of government, with Li Qiang being the incumbent premier. The premier is officially nominated by the president and then elected by the NPC, and has generally been either the second or third-ranking member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC). The premier presides over the State Council, China's cabinet, composed of four vice premiers, state councilors, and the heads of ministries and commissions.[200] The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is a political advisory body that is critical in China's \"united front\" system, which aims to gather non-CCP voices to support the CCP. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n541. **^** \"Obesity Sickening China's Young Hearts\". 4 August 2000. *People's Daily*.

This makes China one of the world's last countries governed by a communist party.

Han involvement in Central Asia and Sogdia helped establish the land route of the Silk Road, replacing the earlier path over the Himalayas to India. Han China gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world.[58] Despite the Han's initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the Qin philosophy of Legalism in favor of Confucianism, Qin's legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the Han government and its successors.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent, and which was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago.\nChina has one of the oldest sporting cultures in the world.

Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BCE) constituted the earliest Chinese writing system.[41]\n\n\n\n### Early dynastic rule[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe region that is now China has been inhabited since the Paleolithic era. The earliest Chinese dynastic states, such as the Shang and the Zhou, emerged in the basin of the Yellow River before the late second millennium BCE. The eighth to third centuries BCE saw a breakdown in Zhou authority and significant conflict, as well as the emergence of Classical Chinese literature and philosophy. In 221 BCE, China was unified under an emperor for the first time, ushering in more than two millennia in which China was governed by one or more imperial dynasties, including the Han, Tang, Ming and Qing. Some of China's most notable achievements—such as the invention of gunpowder and paper, the establishment of the Silk Road, and the building of the Great Wall—occurred during this period. The Chinese culture—including languages, traditions, architecture, philosophy and more—has heavily influenced East Asia during this imperial period.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween the 10th and 11th century CE, the population of China doubled in size to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song dynasty also saw a revival of Confucianism, in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang,[68] and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts, as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity.[69][70] However, the military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jurchen Jin dynasty. In 1127, Emperor Huizong of Song and the capital Bianjing were captured during the Jin–Song Wars. The remnants of the Song retreated to southern China.[71]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 1 October 1949, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong formally proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China at the new nation's founding ceremony and inaugural military parade in Tiananmen Square, Beijing.[111] In 1950, the People's Liberation Army captured Hainan from the ROC[112] and annexed Tibet.[113] However, remaining Kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western China throughout the 1950s.[114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the 2007–08 financial crisis, Chinese authorities sought to actively wean off of its dependence on the U.S. dollar as a result of perceived weaknesses of the international monetary system.[369] To achieve those ends, China took a series of actions to further the internationalization of the Renminbi. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe situation of human rights in China has attracted significant criticism from a number of foreign governments, foreign press agencies, and non-governmental organizations, alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial, forced confessions, torture, restrictions of fundamental rights, and excessive use of the death penalty.[206][274] Since its inception, Freedom House has ranked China as \"not free\" in its *Freedom in the World* survey,[206] while Amnesty International has documented significant human rights abuses.[274] The Constitution of the People's Republic of China states that the \"fundamental rights\" of citizens include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, universal suffrage, and property rights. However, in practice, these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state.[275][276] China has limited protections regarding LGBT rights.[277]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Lihaozhai High School in Jianshui, Yunnan.

In 2009, the government began a 3-year large-scale healthcare provision initiative worth US$124 billion.[530] By 2011, the campaign resulted in 95% of China's population having basic health insurance coverage.[531] By 2022, China had established itself as a key producer and exporter of pharmaceuticals, with the country alone producing around 40 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients in 2017.[532]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n553. **^** Yin 殷, Haishan 海山; Li 李, Yaozong 耀宗; Guo 郭, Jie 洁, eds.

Chinese rap, Chinese hip hop and Hong Kong hip hop have become popular in contemporary times.[610]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChinese cuisine is highly diverse, drawing on several millennia of culinary history and geographical variety, in which the most influential are known as the \"Eight Major Cuisines\", including Sichuan, Cantonese, Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Hunan, Anhui, and Zhejiang cuisines.[593] Chinese cuisine is also known for its width of cooking methods and ingredients,[594] as well as food therapy that is emphasized by traditional Chinese medicine.[595][*better source needed*] Generally, China's staple food is rice in the south, wheat-based breads and noodles in the north. The diet of the common people in pre-modern times was largely grain and simple vegetables, with meat reserved for special occasions. The bean products, such as tofu and soy milk, remain as a popular source of protein. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe word \"China\" has been used in English since the 16th century; however, it was not a word used by the Chinese themselves during this period. Its origin has been traced through Portuguese, Malay, and Persian back to the Sanskrit word *Cīna*, used in ancient India.[16] \"China\" appears in Richard Eden's 1555 translation[o] of the 1516 journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa.[p][16] Barbosa's usage was derived from Persian *Chīn* (چین), which was in turn derived from Sanskrit *Cīna* (चीन).[21] *Cīna* was first used in early Hindu scripture, including the *Mahābhārata* (5th century BCE) and the *Laws of Manu* (2nd century BCE).[22] In 1655, Martino Martini suggested that the word China is derived ultimately from the name of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE).[23][22] Although usage in Indian sources precedes this dynasty, this derivation is still given in various sources.[24] The origin of the Sanskrit word is a matter of debate, according to the *Oxford English Dictionary*.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n190. **^** Grantham, H.

King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty. He enacted Qin's legalist reforms throughout China, notably the forced standardization of Chinese characters, measurements, road widths (i.e., the cart axles' length), and currency. His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi, Guangdong, and Northern Vietnam.[54] The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death, as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion.[55][56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Mongol conquest of China began in 1205 with the gradual conquest of Western Xia by Genghis Khan,[72] who also invaded Jin territories.[73] In 1271, the Mongol leader Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty, which conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty in 1279. Before the Mongol invasion, the population of Song China was 120 million citizens; this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300.[74] A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang led a rebellion that overthrew the Yuan in 1368 and founded the Ming dynasty as the Hongwu Emperor. Under the Ming dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that admiral Zheng He led the Ming treasure voyages throughout the Indian Ocean, reaching as far as East Africa.[75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nScholars note that in China there is no clear boundary between three teachings religions and local folk religious practice.[559] A 2015 poll conducted by Gallup International found that 61% of Chinese people self-identified as \"convinced atheist\",[566] though Chinese religions or some of their strands are definable as non-theistic and humanistic religions, since they do not believe that divine creativity is completely transcendent, but it is inherent in the world and in particular in the human being.[567] According to a 2014 study, approximately 74% are either non-religious or practice Chinese folk belief, 16% are Buddhists, 2% are Christians, 1% are Muslims, and 8% adhere to other religions including Taoists and folk salvationism.[568] In addition to Han people's local religious practices, there are also various ethnic minority groups in China who maintain their traditional autochthone religions. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_1sCxjZLhmZWSy34SpHfbAsX1","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023;[22][23] and from the time of its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.\n\n\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[27][28][29]\nTheir long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[30] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[31]\nBy 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[32][33] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the *Rigveda*. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the *Rigveda* records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[34] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[35]\nBy 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[36]\nand Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[37]\nEarly political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[38]\nTheir collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[39] but also marked by the declining status of women,[40] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[k][41] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[42]\n\n\nIn the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts.[43]\nMuslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,[44]\neventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[45]\nIn the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[46]\nIn the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[47]\nThe Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[48]\nleaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[l][49]\nGradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root.[53] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[54][55] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[56][57][58][59] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[60]\n\n\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 1.4 billion in 2022.[61]\nDuring the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[62] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[63] India has a space programme with several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. It is the fourth country to land a craft on the moon and the first to do so within 600 kilometres (370 mi) of the Lunar south pole.[64] Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[65] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[66] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[67] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[68] and rising levels of air pollution.[69] India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[70] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[71] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture,[72] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names for India\n\nAccording to the *Oxford English Dictionary* (third edition 2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin *India*, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn the name \"India\" derived successively from Hellenistic Greek *India* ( *Ἰνδία*), ancient Greek *Indos* ( *Ἰνδός*), Old Persian *Hindush* (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit *Sindhu*, or \"river\", specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[73][74] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as *Indoi* (*Ἰνδοί*), which translates as \"The people of the Indus\".[75]\n\n\nThe term *Bharat* (*Bhārat*; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] ⓘ), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[76][77] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name *Bharatavarsha*, which applied originally to North India,[78][79] *Bharat* gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[76][80]\n\n\n*Hindustan* ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] ⓘ) is a Middle Persian name for India that became popular by the 13th century,[81] and was used widely since the era of the Mughal Empire. The meaning of *Hindustan* has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.[76][80][82]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of India and History of the Republic of India\n\n### Ancient India[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Manuscript illustration, c. 1650, of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana, composed in story-telling fashion c. 400 BCE – c. 300 CE[83]\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or *Homo sapiens*, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[27][28][29] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[27] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[84] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[85][84] the first urban culture in South Asia,[86] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[87] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[86]\n\n\nDuring the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[88] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[89] were composed during this period,[90] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[88] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[89] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[91] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[88] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[92] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[92]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cave 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta Caves\nIn the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the *mahajanapadas*.[93][94] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[95] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[96][97][98] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[99] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[100] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[101][102] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist *dhamma*.[103][104]\n\n\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia.[105][106] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[107][100] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[108][109] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[110] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[109] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[109]\n\n\n\n### Medieval India[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nBrihadeshwara temple, Thanjavur, completed in 1010 CE\n![](image)\nThe Qutub Minar, 73 m (240 ft) tall, completed by the Sultan of Delhi, Iltutmish\n\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[111] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[112] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[112] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[112] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[111] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[113] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[113]\n\n\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[114] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[114] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[115] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[115] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[116] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[116]\n\n\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[117] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[118][119] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[120][121] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[122] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[123] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[122]\n\n\n\n### Early modern India[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[124] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[125] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[126][127] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[128] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[129] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[128] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[130] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[131] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[129] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[129] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[132] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[133] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[133] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[134]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA distant view of the Taj Mahal from the Agra Fort\n![](image)\nA two mohur Company gold coin, issued in 1835, the obverse inscribed \"William IV, King\"\n\nBy the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[135][136] The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[137][135][138][139] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[140] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.[135] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.[141]\n\n\n\n### Modern India[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Republic of India\n\nHistorians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[142][143][144][145] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[146][147] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[148][149] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[150][151][152][153]\n\n\nThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[154] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[155] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[156] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[157] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[158] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[158] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[157]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n1909 map of the British Indian Empire\n![](image)\nJawaharlal Nehru sharing a light moment with Mahatma Gandhi, Mumbai, 6 July 1946\n\nAfter World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[159] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[160] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[161] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.[162]\n\n\nVital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.[163] Per the London Declaration, India retained its membership of the Commonwealth, becoming the first republic within it.[164] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1980s and the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical know-how,[165] has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world's fastest-growing economies,[166] and increased its geopolitical clout. Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban;[167] by religious and caste-related violence;[168] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[169] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[170] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[171] and with Pakistan.[171] India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[172]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of India\n\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[173] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[173] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[173] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[173] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[174] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[175] The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.[176][177][178]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Tungabhadra, with rocky outcrops, flows into the peninsular Krishna river.[179]\n![](image)\nFishing boats lashed together in a tidal creek in Anjarle village, Maharashtra\n\nThe remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[180] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[181] the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude[m] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.[182]\n\n\nIndia's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[183] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[183]\n\n\nMajor Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal.[184] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[185][186] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;[187] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.[188] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[189] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[190]\n\n\nIndian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[191] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[192][193] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.[191] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.[194]\n\n\nTemperatures in India have risen by 0.7 °C (1.3 °F) between 1901 and 2018.[195] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[196] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[197]\n\n\n\n## Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Forestry in India and Wildlife of India\n\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[198] India is a habitat for 8.6% of all mammal species, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[199][200] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[201] India also contains four of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots,[70] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[n][202]\n\n\nAccording to official statistics, India's forest cover is 713,789 km2 (275,595 sq mi), which is 21.71% of the country's total land area.[71] It can be subdivided further into broad categories of *canopy density*, or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy.[203] *Very dense forest*, whose *canopy density* is greater than 70%, occupies 3.02% of India's land area.[203][204] It predominates in the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India. *Moderately dense forest*, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India's land area.[203][204] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous *sal* forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[205] *Open forest*, whose canopy density is between 10% and 40%, occupies 9.26% of India's land area.[203][204] India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.[206]\n\n\nAmong the Indian subcontinent's notable indigenous trees are the astringent *Azadirachta indica*, or *neem*, which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine,[207] and the luxuriant *Ficus religiosa*, or *peepul*,[208] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[209] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[210]\n\n\nMany Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago.[211] India's subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[212] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the Himalayas.[213] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India's mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[200] Among endemics are the vulnerable[214] hooded leaf monkey[215] and the threatened[216] Beddome's toad[216][217] of the Western Ghats.\n\n\nIndia contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[218] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.[219] Before they were extensively used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.[220] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act[221] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[222] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteen biosphere reserves,[223] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; seventy-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[224]\n\n\n\n* ![India has the majority of the world's wild tigers, approximately 3,170 in 2022.[225]](image)\n\nIndia has the majority of the world's wild tigers, approximately 3,170 in 2022.[225]\n* ![A chital (Axis axis) stag in the Nagarhole National Park in a region covered by a moderately dense[o] forest.](image)\n\nA chital (*Axis axis*) stag in the Nagarhole National Park in a region covered by a moderately dense[o] forest.\n* ![Three of the last Asiatic cheetahs in India were shot dead in 1948 in Surguja district, Madhya Pradesh, Central India by Maharajah Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo.

V.[226]\n\nA parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[227] India has six recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 50 regional parties.[228] The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian political culture,[229] and the BJP right-wing.[230][231][232] For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the Parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[233] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the centre.[234]\n\n\nIn the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; Morarji Desai and Charan Singh. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar.[235] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[236]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nUS president Barack Obama addresses the members of the Parliament of India in New Delhi in November 2010.\n\nA two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. There were two prime ministers during this period; H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.[237] Again in the 2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India's communist parties.[238] That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.[239] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.[240] In the 2019 general election, the BJP was victorious again. The incumbent prime minister is Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat. On 22 July 2022, Droupadi Murmu was elected India's 15th president and took the oath of office on 25 July 2022.[241]\n\n\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of India and Constitution of India\n\n![](image)\nRashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India, was designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker for the Viceroy of India, and constructed between 1911 and 1931 during the British Raj.[242]\n\nIndia is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India—the country's supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic.\n\n\nFederalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[243] originally stated India to be a \"sovereign, democratic republic;\" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to \"a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic\".[244] India's form of government, traditionally described as \"quasi-federal\" with a strong centre and weak states,[245] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[246][247]\n\n\n\n\n\nNational symbols[1]| Emblem | Sarnath Lion Capital |\n| Anthem | *Jana Gana Mana* |\n| Song | \"Vande Mataram\" |\n| Language | None[248][249][250] |\n| Currency | ₹ (Indian rupee) |\n| Calendar | Shaka |\n| Bird | Indian peafowl |\n| Flower | Lotus |\n| Fruit | Mango |\n| Mammal | * Bengal tiger\n* River dolphin\n |\n| Tree | Banyan |\n| River | Ganges |\n\n\nThe Government of India comprises three branches:[251]\n\n\n\n* Executive: The President of India is the ceremonial head of state,[252] who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures.[253][254] The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power.[255] Appointed by the president,[256] the prime minister is by convention supported by the party or political alliance having a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.[255] The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice-president, and the Union Council of Ministers—with the cabinet being its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.[252] In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them.[257]\n* Legislature: The legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People).[258] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered six-year terms.[259] Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population.[256] All but two of the Lok Sabha's 545 members are elected directly by popular vote; they represent single-member constituencies for five-year terms.[260] Two seats of parliament, reserved for Anglo-Indians in the article 331, have been scrapped.[261][262]\n* Judiciary: India has a three-tier unitary independent judiciary[263] comprising the supreme court, headed by the Chief Justice of India, 25 high courts, and a large number of trial courts.[263] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts.[264] It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution[265] and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.[266]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of India\n\nSee also: Political integration of India\n\nIndia is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[13] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[267] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.[268]\n\n\n\n![](image)A clickable map of the 28 states and 8 union territories of India\n  \n\n\n\n\n#### States[edit]\n\n\n1.

Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the third, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the independence of Bangladesh.[273] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d'état attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[274]\n\n\nAside from its ongoing special relationship with Russia,[275] India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[276] India has close economic ties with countries in South America,[277] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a \"Look East\" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.[278][279]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Indian Air Force contingent marching at the 221st Bastille Day military parade in Paris, on 14 July 2009. The parade at which India was the foreign guest was led by India's oldest regiment, the Maratha Light Infantry, founded in 1768.[280]\n\nChina's nuclear test of 1964, as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons.[281] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[282] India maintains a \"no first use\" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \"Minimum Credible Deterrence\" doctrine.[283][284] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[285][286] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of *Vikrant*-class aircraft carriers and *Arihant*-class nuclear submarines.[287]\n\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union.[288] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[289] India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[290] France,[291] the United Kingdom,[292] and Canada.[293]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India (left, background) in talks with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico during a visit to Mexico, 2016\n\nThe President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's armed forces; with 1.45 million active troops, they compose the world's second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard.[294] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03 billion, or 1.83% of GDP.[295] Defence expenditure was pegged at US$70.12 billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% than previous fiscal year.[296][297] India is the world's second-largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms imports.[298] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.[299] In May 2017, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the South Asia Satellite, a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC countries.[300] In October 2018, India signed a US$5.43 billion (over ₹400 billion) agreement with Russia to procure four S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence systems, Russia's most advanced long-range missile defence system.[301]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of India\n\n![](image)\nA farmer in northwestern Karnataka ploughs his field with a tractor even as another in a field beyond does the same with a pair of oxen. In 2019, 43% of India's total workforce was employed in agriculture.[302]\n![](image)\nIndia is the world's largest producer of milk, with the largest population of cattle. In 2018, nearly 80% of India's milk was sourced from small farms with herd size between one and two, the milk harvested by hand milking.[304]\n![](image)\nWomen tend to a recently planted rice field in Junagadh district in Gujarat. 55% of India's female workforce was employed in agriculture in 2019.[303]\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2022 was nominally worth $3.46 trillion; it was the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates and is, around $11.6 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).[305] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012,[306] India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.[307] However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP.[308] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[309] since then, it has moved increasingly towards a free-market system[310][311] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[312] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[313]\n\n\nThe 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world's second-largest, as of 2017[update].[294] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India's foreign exchange remittances of US$100 billion in 2022,[314] highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries.[315] Major agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[13] Major industries include textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[13] In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[310] In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.68%;[316] In 2021, India was the world's ninth-largest importer and the sixteenth-largest exporter.[317] Major exports include petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods.[13] Major imports include crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[13] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[318] India was the world's second-largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.[319]\n\n\nAveraging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007,[310] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century.[320] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India's middle classes are projected to number around 580 million by 2030.[321] Though ranking 68th in global competitiveness,[322] as of 2010[update], India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies.[323] With seven of the world's top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of 2009[update], the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States.[324] India is ranked 40th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[325] India's consumer market, the world's eleventh-largest,[*as of?*] is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030.[321]\n\n\nDriven by growth, India's nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$1,730 in 2016. It is expected to grow to US$2,466 by 2022.[17] However, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to remain so in the near future.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panorama of Bangalore, the centre of India's software development economy. In the 1980s, when the first multinational corporations began to set up centres in India, they chose Bangalore because of the large pool of skilled graduates in the area, in turn due to the many science and engineering colleges in the surrounding region.[326]\n\nAccording to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, India's GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045.[327] During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050.[327] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle-class.[327] The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.[328]\n\n\nAccording to the Worldwide Cost of Living Report 2017 released by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) which was created by comparing more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services, four of the cheapest cities were in India: Bangalore (3rd), Mumbai (5th), Chennai (5th) and New Delhi (8th).[329]\n\n\n\n### Industries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nA tea garden in Sikkim. India, the world's second-largest producer of tea, is a nation of one billion tea drinkers, who consume 70% of India's tea output.\n\nIndia's telecommunication industry is the second-largest in the world with over 1.2 billion subscribers. It contributes 6.5% to India's GDP.[330] After the third quarter of 2017, India surpassed the US to become the second-largest smartphone market in the world after China.[331]\n\n\nThe Indian automotive industry, the world's second-fastest growing, increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009–2010,[332] and exports by 36% during 2008–2009.[333] In 2022, India became the world's third-largest vehicle market after China and the United States, surpassing Japan.[334] At the end of 2011, the Indian IT industry employed 2.8 million professionals, generated revenues close to US$100 billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and contributed 26% of India's merchandise exports.[335]\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry in India emerged as a global player. As of 2021, with 3000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 manufacturing units India is the world's third-largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic medicines and supply up to 50—60% of global vaccines demand, these all contribute up to US$24.44 billions in exports and India's local pharmaceutical market is estimated up to US$42 billion.[336][337] India is among the top 12 biotech destinations in the world.[338][339] The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012–2013, increasing its revenues from ₹204.4 billion (Indian rupees) to ₹235.24 billion (US$3.94 billion at June 2013 exchange rates).[340]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Energy in India and Energy policy of India\n\nIndia's capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable.[341] The country's usage of coal is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions by India but its renewable energy is competing strongly.[342] India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average.[343][344] Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India.[345]\n\n\n\n### Socio-economic challenges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nHealth workers about to begin another day of immunisation against infectious diseases in 2006. Eight years later, and three years after India's last case of polio, the World Health Organization declared India to be polio-free.[346]\n\nDespite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day.[347] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005.[348] Under the World Bank's later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011.[p][350] 30.7% of India's children under the age of five are underweight.[351] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished.[352][353] The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates.[354]\n\n\nA 2018 Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8 million people in India were living in different forms of modern slavery, such as bonded labour, child labour, human trafficking, and forced begging, among others.[355] According to the 2011 census, there were 10.1 million child labourers in the country, a decline of 2.6 million from 12.6 million in 2001.[356]\n\n\nSince 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.[357] Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100, an improvement from 85th in 2014.[358][359]\n\n\nEpidemic and pandemic diseases have long been a major factor, including COVID-19 recently.[360]\n\n\n\n## Demographics, languages and religion[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of India, Languages of India, and Religion in India\n\nSee also: South Asian ethnic groups\n\nIndia by language\n![](image)\nThe language families of South Asia\n\nWith 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census report,[361] India was the world's second-most populous country.[q] Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011,[363] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991–2001).[363] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males.[361] The median age was 28.7 as of 2020[update].[294] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361 million people.[364] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the \"Green Revolution\" have caused India's population to grow rapidly.[365]\n\n\nThe life expectancy in India is at 70 years—71.5 years for women, 68.7 years for men.[294] There are around 93 physicians per 100,000 people.[366] Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India's recent history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[367] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas.[368][369] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[370] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[371] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males.[372] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas.[370] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.[372]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe interior of San Thome Basilica, Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Christianity is believed to have been introduced to India by the late 2nd century by Syriac-speaking Christians.\n\nAmong speakers of the Indian languages, 74% speak Indo-Aryan languages, the easternmost branch of the Indo-European languages; 24% speak Dravidian languages, indigenous to South Asia and spoken widely before the spread of Indo-Aryan languages and 2% speak Austroasiatic languages or the Sino-Tibetan languages. India has no national language.[373] Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government.[374][375] English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a \"subsidiary official language\";[6] it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 \"scheduled languages\".\n\n\nThe 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others[r] (0.9%).[12] India has the third-largest Muslim population—the largest for a non-Muslim majority country.[376][377]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of India\n\n![](image)\nA Sikh pilgrim at the Harmandir Sahib, or Golden Temple, in Amritsar, Punjab\n\nIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[378] During the Vedic period (c. 1700 BCE – c. 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as *dhárma*, *kárma*, *yóga*, and *mokṣa*, were established.[75] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions.[379] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the *Upanishads*,[380] the *Yoga Sutras*, the *Bhakti* movement,[379] and by Buddhist philosophy.[381]\n\n\n\n### Visual art[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian art\n\nIndia has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[382] Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The \"Pashupati\" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known.[383][384] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[384][385] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[386][387][388] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[389] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing *prana* (\"breath\" or life-force).[390][391] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[392][393]\n\n\nMost of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[394] or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[395][396] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[397] Gupta art, at its peak c. 300 CE – c. 500 CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[398][399] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c. 800 CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[400] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[401][402]\n\n\nAncient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[403][404] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings.[405] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[406][407] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh.[408][409] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[410][411] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.[412][413]\n\n\n\n* ![Bhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd century CE](image)\n\nBhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd century CE\n* ![Gupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century](image)\n\nGupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century\n* ![Elephanta Caves, triple-bust (trimurti) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5 m) tall, c. 550](image)\n\nElephanta Caves, triple-bust (*trimurti*) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5 m) tall, c. 550\n* ![Chola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century](image)\n\nChola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century\n* ![Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign, Balchand, c. 1635](image)\n\n*Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign*, Balchand, c. 1635\n* ![Krishna Fluting to the Milkmaids, Kangra painting, 1775–1785](image)\n\n*Krishna Fluting to the Milkmaids*, Kangra painting, 1775–1785\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of India\n\n![](image)\nThe Taj Mahal from across the Yamuna river showing two outlying red sandstone buildings, a mosque on the right (west) and a *jawab* (response) thought to have been built for architectural balance\n\nMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[414] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours. *Vastu shastra*, literally \"science of construction\" or \"architecture\" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[415] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[416] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.[417] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the *Shilpa Shastras*, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the *Vastu-Purusha mandala*, a square that embodied the \"absolute\".[418] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\".[419] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.[420]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian literature\n\nThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500 BCE and 1200 CE, was in the Sanskrit language.[421] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the *Rigveda* (c. 1500 BCE – c. 1200 BCE), the epics: *Mahābhārata* (c. 400 BCE – c. 400 CE) and the *Ramayana* (c. 300 BCE and later); *Abhijñānaśākuntalam* (*The Recognition of Śakuntalā*, and other dramas of Kālidāsa (c. 5th century CE) and *Mahākāvya* poetry.[422][423][424] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c. 600 BCE – c. 300 BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[425][426][427][428] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.[429] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore,[430] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n\n\n### Performing arts and media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of India, Dance in India, Cinema of India, and Television in India\n\n![](image)\nIndia's National Academy of Performance Arts has recognised eight Indian dance styles to be *classical*. One such is Kuchipudi shown here.\n\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and the southern Carnatic schools.[431] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the *bauls* is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: *bhangra* of Punjab, *bihu* of Assam, *Jhumair* and *chhau* of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, *garba* and *dandiya* of Gujarat, *ghoomar* of Rajasthan, and *lavani* of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: *bharatanatyam* of the state of Tamil Nadu, *kathak* of Uttar Pradesh, *kathakali* and *mohiniyattam* of Kerala, *kuchipudi* of Andhra Pradesh, *manipuri* of Manipur, *odissi* of Odisha, and the *sattriya* of Assam.[432]\n\n\nTheatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[433] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the *bhavai* of Gujarat, the *jatra* of West Bengal, the *nautanki* and *ramlila* of North India, *tamasha* of Maharashtra, *burrakatha* of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, *terukkuttu* of Tamil Nadu, and the *yakshagana* of Karnataka.[434] India has a theatre training institute the National School of Drama (NSD) that is situated at New Delhi. It is an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of culture, Government of India.[435]\nThe Indian film industry produces the world's most-watched cinema.[436] Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages.[437] The Hindi language film industry (*Bollywood*) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue, followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined.[438]\n\n\nTelevision broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades.[439][440] The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society.[441] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012[update] there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462 million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press (350 million), radio (156 million) or internet (37 million).[442]\n\n\n\n### Society[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nMuslims offer *namaz* at a mosque in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nTraditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as *jātis*, or \"castes\".[443] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.\n\n\nFamily values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[444] An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders.[445] Marriage is thought to be for life,[445] and the divorce rate is extremely low,[446] with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[447] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[448] Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period, and constituting 20 percent of India's female electorate.[449] According to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care.[450] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society.[451] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[452] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[453]\n\n\nMany Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[454][455]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in India, Literacy in India, and History of education in the Indian subcontinent\n\n![](image)Children awaiting school lunch in Rayka (also Raika), a village in rural Gujarat. The salutation *Jai Bhim* written on the blackboard honours the jurist, social reformer, and Dalit leader B. R. Ambedkar.\nIn the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[456][457] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.[458]\n\n\nThe education system of India is the world's second-largest.[459] India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[460] and 1.5 million schools.[461] In India's higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[462][463]\n\n\n\n### Clothing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Clothing in India\n\n![](image)\nWomen in sari at an adult literacy class in Tamil Nadu\n![](image)\nA man in dhoti and wearing a woollen shawl, in Varanasi\n\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped.[464] For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long.[464] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder.[464] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end—passing over the shoulder—serving to cover the midriff and obscure the upper body's contours.[464] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[465]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nWomen (from left to right) in churidars and kameez (with back to the camera), jeans and sweater, and pink shalwar kameez\n\nThe use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (c. 1300 CE) and then continued by the Mughal Empire (c. 1525 CE).[466] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[466] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[466]\n\n\nShalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[467] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[468] its side seams left open below the waist-line.[469] The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer's knees.[470]\n\n\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[471] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[471] In white-collar office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[471] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear bandgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[471] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[472]\nis seldom seen in the cities.[471]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian cuisine\n\n![](image)\nSouth Indian vegetarian thali, or platter\n![](image)\nRailway mutton curry from Odisha\n\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[473] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread made from wheat flour, or occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry;[474] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake, or dosa, a griddled pancake, both leavened and made from a batter of rice- and gram meal.[475] The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions.[473] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking.[476]\n\n\nA platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments, which are often served in small bowls. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables or lentils.[473]\n\n\n\nA tandoor chef in the Turkman Gate, Old Delhi, makes Khameeri roti (a Muslim-influenced style of leavened bread).[477]\nIndia has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[478] The appearance of *ahimsa*, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India's Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as among Jains.[478] Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[479] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.[480]\n\n\nThe most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf,[481] developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[482] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[483] To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India.[483] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become the Indian biryani,[483] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[484] In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken—cooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from Central Asia—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition of India.[478]\n\n\n\n### Sports and recreation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in India\n\n![](image)\nGirls play hopscotch in Jaora, Madhya Pradesh. Hopscotch has been commonly played by girls in rural India.[485]\n\nSeveral traditional indigenous sports such as *kabaddi*, *kho kho*, *pehlwani* and *gilli-danda*, and also martial arts such as *Kalarippayattu* and *marma adi*, remain popular. Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as *chaturaṅga*;[486] in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters.[487] Viswanathan Anand became the Chess World Champion in 2007 and held the status until 2013. He also won the Chess World Cup in 2000 and 2002. In 2023, R Praggnanandhaa finished as runners up in the tournament. [488] Parcheesi is derived from *Pachisi*, another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great.[489]\n\n\nCricket is the most popular sport in India.[490] Major domestic leagues include the Indian Premier League. Professional leagues in other sports include the Indian Super League (football) and the Pro Kabaddi league.[491][492][493]\n\n\n\n![](image)Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar about to score a record 14,000 runs in Test cricket while playing against Australia in Bangalore, 2010\nIndia has won two Cricket World Cups, the 1983 edition and the 2011 edition, as well as becoming the inaugural T20 World Cup Champions in 2007. India has also won the Champions Trophy twice, in 2002 and 2013. The only edition of the World Championship of Cricket was won by India in 1985. \n\n\nIndia also has eight field hockey gold medals in the summer olympics.[494]\nThe improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other tennis players in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country.[495] India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth Games.[496][497] Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton[498] (Saina Nehwal and P. V. Sindhu are two of the top-ranked female badminton players in the world), boxing,[499] and wrestling.[500] Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.India has traditionally been the dominant country at the South Asian Games. An example of this dominance is the basketball competition where the Indian team won four out of five tournaments to date.[501][502]\n\n\nIndia has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1951 and 1982 Asian Games; the 1987, 1996, 2011 and 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup tournaments (and is also scheduled to host it in 2031); the 1978, 1997 and 2013 ICC Women's Cricket World Cup tournaments (and is also scheduled to host it in 2025); the 1987, 1985 and 2016 South Asian Games; the 1990-91 Men's Asia Cup; the 2002 Chess World Cup; the 2003 Afro-Asian Games; the 2006 ICC Cricket Champion's Trophy (and is also scheduled to host it in 2029); the 2006 Women's Asia Cup; the 2009 World Badminton Championships; the 2010 Hockey World Cup; the 2010 Commonwealth Games; the 2016 ICC Men's Cricket T20 World Cup (and is also scheduled to host it in 2026); the 2016 ICC Women's Cricket T20 World Cup and the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Major international sporting events held annually in India include the Maharashtra Open, the Mumbai Marathon, the Delhi Half Marathon, and the Indian Masters. The first Formula 1 Indian Grand Prix featured in late 2011 but has been discontinued from the F1 season calendar since 2014.[503]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n\n\n* Administrative divisions of India\n* Outline of India\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Originally written in Sanskritised Bengali and adopted as the national anthem in its Hindi translation.\n2. **^** \"[...] *Jana Gana Mana* is the National Anthem of India, subject to such alterations in the words as the Government may authorise as occasion arises; and the song *Vande Mataram*, which has played a historic part in the struggle for Indian freedom, shall be honoured equally with *Jana Gana Mana* and shall have equal status with it.\"[5]\n3. **^** Written in a mixture of Sanskrit and Sanskritised Bengali.\n4. **^** According to Part XVII of the Constitution of India, Hindi in the Devanagari script is the official language of the Union, along with English as an additional official language.[1][6][7] States and union territories can have a different official language of their own other than Hindi or English.\n5. **^** Not all the state-level official languages are in the eighth schedule and not all the scheduled languages are state-level official languages.

It is known from internal evidence that the Vedic texts were orally composed in northern India, at first in the Greater Punjab and later on also in more eastern areas, including northern Bihar, between ca. 1500 BCE and ca. 500–400 BCE. The oldest text, the Rgveda, must have been more or less contemporary with the Mitanni texts of northern Syria/Iraq (1450–1350 BCE); ... The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalised early on. This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is in fact something of a *tape-recording* of ca. 1500–500 BCE. Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present. (pp. 68–69) ...

Its elite called itself Arya (pure) and distinguished themselves sharply from others. Aryans led kin groups organized as nomadic horse-herding tribes. Their ritual texts are called Vedas, composed in Sanskrit. Vedic Sanskrit is recorded only in hymns that were part of Vedic rituals to Aryan gods. To be Aryan apparently meant to belong to the elite among pastoral tribes. Texts that record Aryan culture are not precisely datable, but they seem to begin around 1200 BCE with four collections of Vedic hymns (Rg, Sama, Yajur, and Artharva).\"\n  \n(d) Dyson 2018, pp. 14–15, \"Although the collapse of the Indus valley civilization is no longer believed to have been due to an 'Aryan invasion' it is widely thought that, at roughly the same time, or perhaps a few centuries later, new Indo-Aryan-speaking people and influences began to enter the subcontinent from the north-west. Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, a predecessor of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of these languages belonged to the Indo-European language family. ... It seems likely that various small-scale migrations were involved in the gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics. However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the one hand, and changes in language and culture on the other. Moreover, the process whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose—a people with a distinct ideology who eventually seem to have referred to themselves as 'Arya'—was certainly two-way. That is, it involved a blending of new features which came from outside with other features—probably including some surviving Harappan influences—that were already present. Anyhow, it would be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and stories of the Arya people—especially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and Ramayana epics—are poor guides as to historical events. Of course, the emerging Arya were to have a huge impact on the history of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, little is known about their early presence.\";   \n (e) Robb 2011, pp. 46–, \"The expansion of Aryan culture is supposed to have begun around 1500 BCE.

Geographical location, personal and popular sentiment, and substantial pressure and incentives from the new governments led almost all princes eventually to merge their domains into either Pakistan or India. ... Each new government asserted its exclusive sovereignty within its borders, realigning all territories, animals, plants, minerals, and all other natural and human-made resources as either Pakistani or Indian property, to be used for its national development... Simultaneously, the central civil and military services and judiciary split roughly along religious 'communal' lines, even as they divided movable government assets according to a negotiated formula: 22.7 percent for Pakistan and 77.3 percent for India.\"\n57. **^** Chatterji, Joya; Washbrook, David (2013), \"Introduction: Concepts and Questions\", in Chatterji, Joya; Washbrook, David (eds.), *Routledge Handbook of the South Asian Diaspora*, London and New York: Routledge, ISBN 978-0-415-48010-9, Joya Chatterji describes how the partition of the British Indian empire into the new nation states of India and Pakistan produced new diaspora on a vast, and hitherto unprecedented, scale, but hints that the sheer magnitude of refugee movements in South Asia after 1947 must be understood in the context of pre-existing migratory flows within the partitioned regions (see also Chatterji 2013). She also demonstrates that the new national states of India and Pakistan were quickly drawn into trying to stem this migration. As they put into place laws designed to restrict the return of partition emigrants, this produced new dilemmas for both new nations in their treatment of 'overseas Indians'; and many of them lost their right to return to their places of origin in the subcontinent, and also their claims to full citizenship in host countries.\n58. **^** Talbot, Ian; Singh, Gurharpal (2009), *The Partition of India*, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-85661-4, archived from the original on 13 December 2016, retrieved 15 November 2015, When the British divided and quit India in August 1947, they not only partitioned the subcontinent with the emergence of the two nations of India and Pakistan but also the provinces of Punjab and Bengal. ...

They heard about it on the radio, from relations and friends, by reading newspapers and, later, through government pamphlets. Among a population of almost four hundred million, where the vast majority live in the countryside, ploughing the land as landless peasants or sharecroppers, it is hardly surprising that many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, did not hear the news for many weeks afterwards. For some, the butchery and forced relocation of the summer months of 1947 may have been the first that they knew about the creation of the two new states rising from the fragmentary and terminally weakened British empire in India\n60. **^** (a) Copland 2001, pp. 71–78;  \n(b) Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, p. 222.\n61. **^** Dyson 2018, pp. 219, 262\n62. **^** Fisher 2018, p. 8\n63. **^** Metcalf & Metcalf 2012, pp. 265–266\n64. **^** Kumar, Hari; Travelli, Alex; Mashal, Mujib; Chang, Kenneth (23 August 2023), \"'India Is on the Moon': Lander's Success Moves Nation to Next Space Chapter\", *The New York Times*, Two visitors from India — a lander named Vikram and a rover named Pragyan — landed in the southern polar region of the moon on Wednesday.

The term Hindu originated as a geographical term and did not refer to a religion. Later, Hindu was taken by European languages from the Arabic term al-Hind, which referred to the people who lived across the Indus River. This Arabic term was itself taken from the Persian term Hindū, which refers to all Indians.

The PLA's decisive victories in the 1962 war not only humiliated the Indian Army, they also entrenched a status quo in Ladakh that was highly unfavourable for India, in which China controls almost all of the disputed territory.

The outcome of this conflict had far-reaching consequences for Indian foreign and defence policies. The harsh defeat that the Chinese PLA had inflicted on the Indian Army called into question some of the most deeply held precepts of Nehru's foreign and defence policies.\n  \n(f) Raghavan, Srinath (2019), \"A Missed Opportunity?

The skewed ratio of men to women is largely the result of sex-selective abortions, and better nutrition and medical care for boys, according to the government's annual economic survey, which was released on Monday.

In this manner, Central Asian cooking merged with older traditions within the subcontinent, to create such signature dishes as biryani (a fusion of the Persian pilau and the spice-laden dishes of Hindustan), and the Kashmiri meat stew of Rogan Josh. It not only generated new dishes and entire cuisines, but also fostered novel modes of eating. Such newer trends included the consumption of Persian condiments, which relied heavily on almonds, pastries and quince jams, alongside Indian achars made from sweet limes, green vegetables and curds as side relishes during Mughlai meals.\n477. **^** Panjabi, Camellia (1995), *The Great Curries of India*, Simon and Schuster, pp. 158–, ISBN 978-0-684-80383-8, The Muslim influenced breads of India are leavened, like *naan*, *Khamiri roti*, ...\n478. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Davidson, Alan (2014), *The Oxford Companion to Food*, Oxford University Press, p. 410, ISBN 978-0-19-967733-7\n479. **^** Sahakian, Marlyne; Saloma, Czarina; Erkman, Suren (2016), *Food Consumption in the City: Practices and patterns in urban Asia and the Pacific*, Taylor & Francis, p. 50, ISBN 978-1-317-31050-1\n480. **^** OECD; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2018), *OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2018–2027*, OECD Publishing, p. 21, ISBN 978-92-64-06203-0\n481. **^** Roger 2000.\n482. **^** Sengupta, Jayanta (2014), \"India\", in Freedman, Paul; Chaplin, Joyce E.; Albala, Ken (eds.), *Food in Time and Place: The American Historical Association Companion to Food History*, University of California Press, p. 74, ISBN 978-0-520-27745-8\n483. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Collingham, Elizabeth M.

It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023;[22][23] and from the time of its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.\n\n\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[27][28][29]\nTheir long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[30] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[31]\nBy 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[32][33] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the *Rigveda*. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the *Rigveda* records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[34] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[35]\nBy 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[36]\nand Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[37]\nEarly political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[38]\nTheir collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[39] but also marked by the declining status of women,[40] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[k][41] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[42]\n\n\nIn the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts.[43]\nMuslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,[44]\neventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[45]\nIn the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[46]\nIn the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[47]\nThe Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[48]\nleaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[l][49]\nGradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root.[53] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[54][55] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[56][57][58][59] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[60]\n\n\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 1.4 billion in 2022.[61]\nDuring the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[62] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[63] India has a space programme with several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. It is the fourth country to land a craft on the moon and the first to do so within 600 kilometres (370 mi) of the Lunar south pole.[64] Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[65] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[66] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[67] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[68] and rising levels of air pollution.[69] India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[70] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[71] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture,[72] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names for India\n\nAccording to the *Oxford English Dictionary* (third edition 2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin *India*, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn the name \"India\" derived successively from Hellenistic Greek *India* ( *Ἰνδία*), ancient Greek *Indos* ( *Ἰνδός*), Old Persian *Hindush* (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit *Sindhu*, or \"river\", specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[73][74] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as *Indoi* (*Ἰνδοί*), which translates as \"The people of the Indus\".[75]\n\n\nThe term *Bharat* (*Bhārat*; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] ⓘ), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[76][77] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name *Bharatavarsha*, which applied originally to North India,[78][79] *Bharat* gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[76][80]\n\n\n*Hindustan* ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] ⓘ) is a Middle Persian name for India that became popular by the 13th century,[81] and was used widely since the era of the Mughal Empire. The meaning of *Hindustan* has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.[76][80][82]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of India and History of the Republic of India\n\n### Ancient India[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Manuscript illustration, c. 1650, of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana, composed in story-telling fashion c. 400 BCE – c. 300 CE[83]\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or *Homo sapiens*, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[27][28][29] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[27] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[84] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[85][84] the first urban culture in South Asia,[86] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[87] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[86]\n\n\nDuring the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[88] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[89] were composed during this period,[90] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[88] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[89] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[91] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[88] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[92] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[92]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cave 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta Caves\nIn the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the *mahajanapadas*.[93][94] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[95] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[96][97][98] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[99] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[100] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[101][102] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist *dhamma*.[103][104]\n\n\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia.[105][106] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[107][100] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[108][109] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[110] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[109] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[109]\n\n\n\n### Medieval India[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nBrihadeshwara temple, Thanjavur, completed in 1010 CE\n![](image)\nThe Qutub Minar, 73 m (240 ft) tall, completed by the Sultan of Delhi, Iltutmish\n\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[111] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[112] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[112] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[112] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[111] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[113] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[113]\n\n\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[114] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[114] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[115] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[115] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[116] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[116]\n\n\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[117] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[118][119] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[120][121] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[122] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[123] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[122]\n\n\n\n### Early modern India[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[124] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[125] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[126][127] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[128] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[129] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[128] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[130] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[131] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[129] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[129] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[132] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[133] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[133] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[134]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA distant view of the Taj Mahal from the Agra Fort\n![](image)\nA two mohur Company gold coin, issued in 1835, the obverse inscribed \"William IV, King\"\n\nBy the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[135][136] The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[137][135][138][139] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[140] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.[135] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.[141]\n\n\n\n### Modern India[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Republic of India\n\nHistorians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[142][143][144][145] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[146][147] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[148][149] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[150][151][152][153]\n\n\nThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[154] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[155] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[156] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[157] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[158] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[158] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[157]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n1909 map of the British Indian Empire\n![](image)\nJawaharlal Nehru sharing a light moment with Mahatma Gandhi, Mumbai, 6 July 1946\n\nAfter World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[159] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[160] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[161] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.[162]\n\n\nVital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.[163] Per the London Declaration, India retained its membership of the Commonwealth, becoming the first republic within it.[164] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1980s and the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical know-how,[165] has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world's fastest-growing economies,[166] and increased its geopolitical clout. Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban;[167] by religious and caste-related violence;[168] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[169] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[170] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[171] and with Pakistan.[171] India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[172]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of India\n\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[173] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[173] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[173] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[173] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[174] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[175] The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.[176][177][178]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Tungabhadra, with rocky outcrops, flows into the peninsular Krishna river.[179]\n![](image)\nFishing boats lashed together in a tidal creek in Anjarle village, Maharashtra\n\nThe remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[180] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[181] the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude[m] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.[182]\n\n\nIndia's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[183] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[183]\n\n\nMajor Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal.[184] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[185][186] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;[187] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.[188] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[189] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[190]\n\n\nIndian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[191] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[192][193] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.[191] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.[194]\n\n\nTemperatures in India have risen by 0.7 °C (1.3 °F) between 1901 and 2018.[195] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[196] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[197]\n\n\n\n## Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Forestry in India and Wildlife of India\n\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[198] India is a habitat for 8.6% of all mammal species, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[199][200] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[201] India also contains four of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots,[70] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[n][202]\n\n\nAccording to official statistics, India's forest cover is 713,789 km2 (275,595 sq mi), which is 21.71% of the country's total land area.[71] It can be subdivided further into broad categories of *canopy density*, or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy.[203] *Very dense forest*, whose *canopy density* is greater than 70%, occupies 3.02% of India's land area.[203][204] It predominates in the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India. *Moderately dense forest*, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India's land area.[203][204] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous *sal* forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[205] *Open forest*, whose canopy density is between 10% and 40%, occupies 9.26% of India's land area.[203][204] India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.[206]\n\n\nAmong the Indian subcontinent's notable indigenous trees are the astringent *Azadirachta indica*, or *neem*, which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine,[207] and the luxuriant *Ficus religiosa*, or *peepul*,[208] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[209] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[210]\n\n\nMany Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago.[211] India's subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[212] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the Himalayas.[213] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India's mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[200] Among endemics are the vulnerable[214] hooded leaf monkey[215] and the threatened[216] Beddome's toad[216][217] of the Western Ghats.\n\n\nIndia contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[218] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.[219] Before they were extensively used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.[220] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act[221] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[222] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteen biosphere reserves,[223] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; seventy-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[224]\n\n\n\n* ![India has the majority of the world's wild tigers, approximately 3,170 in 2022.[225]](image)\n\nIndia has the majority of the world's wild tigers, approximately 3,170 in 2022.[225]\n* ![A chital (Axis axis) stag in the Nagarhole National Park in a region covered by a moderately dense[o] forest.](image)\n\nA chital (*Axis axis*) stag in the Nagarhole National Park in a region covered by a moderately dense[o] forest.\n* ![Three of the last Asiatic cheetahs in India were shot dead in 1948 in Surguja district, Madhya Pradesh, Central India by Maharajah Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo.

V.[226]\n\nA parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[227] India has six recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 50 regional parties.[228] The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian political culture,[229] and the BJP right-wing.[230][231][232] For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the Parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[233] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the centre.[234]\n\n\nIn the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; Morarji Desai and Charan Singh. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar.[235] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[236]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nUS president Barack Obama addresses the members of the Parliament of India in New Delhi in November 2010.\n\nA two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. There were two prime ministers during this period; H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.[237] Again in the 2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India's communist parties.[238] That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.[239] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.[240] In the 2019 general election, the BJP was victorious again. The incumbent prime minister is Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat. On 22 July 2022, Droupadi Murmu was elected India's 15th president and took the oath of office on 25 July 2022.[241]\n\n\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of India and Constitution of India\n\n![](image)\nRashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India, was designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker for the Viceroy of India, and constructed between 1911 and 1931 during the British Raj.[242]\n\nIndia is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India—the country's supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic.\n\n\nFederalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[243] originally stated India to be a \"sovereign, democratic republic;\" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to \"a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic\".[244] India's form of government, traditionally described as \"quasi-federal\" with a strong centre and weak states,[245] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[246][247]\n\n\n\n\n\nNational symbols[1]| Emblem | Sarnath Lion Capital |\n| Anthem | *Jana Gana Mana* |\n| Song | \"Vande Mataram\" |\n| Language | None[248][249][250] |\n| Currency | ₹ (Indian rupee) |\n| Calendar | Shaka |\n| Bird | Indian peafowl |\n| Flower | Lotus |\n| Fruit | Mango |\n| Mammal | * Bengal tiger\n* River dolphin\n |\n| Tree | Banyan |\n| River | Ganges |\n\n\nThe Government of India comprises three branches:[251]\n\n\n\n* Executive: The President of India is the ceremonial head of state,[252] who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures.[253][254] The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power.[255] Appointed by the president,[256] the prime minister is by convention supported by the party or political alliance having a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.[255] The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice-president, and the Union Council of Ministers—with the cabinet being its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.[252] In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them.[257]\n* Legislature: The legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People).[258] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered six-year terms.[259] Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population.[256] All but two of the Lok Sabha's 545 members are elected directly by popular vote; they represent single-member constituencies for five-year terms.[260] Two seats of parliament, reserved for Anglo-Indians in the article 331, have been scrapped.[261][262]\n* Judiciary: India has a three-tier unitary independent judiciary[263] comprising the supreme court, headed by the Chief Justice of India, 25 high courts, and a large number of trial courts.[263] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts.[264] It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution[265] and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.[266]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of India\n\nSee also: Political integration of India\n\nIndia is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[13] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[267] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.[268]\n\n\n\n![](image)A clickable map of the 28 states and 8 union territories of India\n  \n\n\n\n\n#### States[edit]\n\n\n1.

Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the third, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the independence of Bangladesh.[273] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d'état attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[274]\n\n\nAside from its ongoing special relationship with Russia,[275] India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[276] India has close economic ties with countries in South America,[277] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a \"Look East\" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.[278][279]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Indian Air Force contingent marching at the 221st Bastille Day military parade in Paris, on 14 July 2009. The parade at which India was the foreign guest was led by India's oldest regiment, the Maratha Light Infantry, founded in 1768.[280]\n\nChina's nuclear test of 1964, as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons.[281] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[282] India maintains a \"no first use\" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \"Minimum Credible Deterrence\" doctrine.[283][284] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[285][286] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of *Vikrant*-class aircraft carriers and *Arihant*-class nuclear submarines.[287]\n\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union.[288] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[289] India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[290] France,[291] the United Kingdom,[292] and Canada.[293]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India (left, background) in talks with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico during a visit to Mexico, 2016\n\nThe President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's armed forces; with 1.45 million active troops, they compose the world's second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard.[294] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03 billion, or 1.83% of GDP.[295] Defence expenditure was pegged at US$70.12 billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% than previous fiscal year.[296][297] India is the world's second-largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms imports.[298] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.[299] In May 2017, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the South Asia Satellite, a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC countries.[300] In October 2018, India signed a US$5.43 billion (over ₹400 billion) agreement with Russia to procure four S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence systems, Russia's most advanced long-range missile defence system.[301]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of India\n\n![](image)\nA farmer in northwestern Karnataka ploughs his field with a tractor even as another in a field beyond does the same with a pair of oxen. In 2019, 43% of India's total workforce was employed in agriculture.[302]\n![](image)\nIndia is the world's largest producer of milk, with the largest population of cattle. In 2018, nearly 80% of India's milk was sourced from small farms with herd size between one and two, the milk harvested by hand milking.[304]\n![](image)\nWomen tend to a recently planted rice field in Junagadh district in Gujarat. 55% of India's female workforce was employed in agriculture in 2019.[303]\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2022 was nominally worth $3.46 trillion; it was the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates and is, around $11.6 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).[305] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012,[306] India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.[307] However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP.[308] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[309] since then, it has moved increasingly towards a free-market system[310][311] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[312] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[313]\n\n\nThe 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world's second-largest, as of 2017[update].[294] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India's foreign exchange remittances of US$100 billion in 2022,[314] highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries.[315] Major agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[13] Major industries include textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[13] In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[310] In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.68%;[316] In 2021, India was the world's ninth-largest importer and the sixteenth-largest exporter.[317] Major exports include petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods.[13] Major imports include crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[13] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[318] India was the world's second-largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.[319]\n\n\nAveraging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007,[310] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century.[320] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India's middle classes are projected to number around 580 million by 2030.[321] Though ranking 68th in global competitiveness,[322] as of 2010[update], India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies.[323] With seven of the world's top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of 2009[update], the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States.[324] India is ranked 40th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[325] India's consumer market, the world's eleventh-largest,[*as of?*] is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030.[321]\n\n\nDriven by growth, India's nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$1,730 in 2016. It is expected to grow to US$2,466 by 2022.[17] However, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to remain so in the near future.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panorama of Bangalore, the centre of India's software development economy. In the 1980s, when the first multinational corporations began to set up centres in India, they chose Bangalore because of the large pool of skilled graduates in the area, in turn due to the many science and engineering colleges in the surrounding region.[326]\n\nAccording to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, India's GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045.[327] During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050.[327] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle-class.[327] The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.[328]\n\n\nAccording to the Worldwide Cost of Living Report 2017 released by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) which was created by comparing more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services, four of the cheapest cities were in India: Bangalore (3rd), Mumbai (5th), Chennai (5th) and New Delhi (8th).[329]\n\n\n\n### Industries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nA tea garden in Sikkim. India, the world's second-largest producer of tea, is a nation of one billion tea drinkers, who consume 70% of India's tea output.\n\nIndia's telecommunication industry is the second-largest in the world with over 1.2 billion subscribers. It contributes 6.5% to India's GDP.[330] After the third quarter of 2017, India surpassed the US to become the second-largest smartphone market in the world after China.[331]\n\n\nThe Indian automotive industry, the world's second-fastest growing, increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009–2010,[332] and exports by 36% during 2008–2009.[333] In 2022, India became the world's third-largest vehicle market after China and the United States, surpassing Japan.[334] At the end of 2011, the Indian IT industry employed 2.8 million professionals, generated revenues close to US$100 billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and contributed 26% of India's merchandise exports.[335]\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry in India emerged as a global player. As of 2021, with 3000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 manufacturing units India is the world's third-largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic medicines and supply up to 50—60% of global vaccines demand, these all contribute up to US$24.44 billions in exports and India's local pharmaceutical market is estimated up to US$42 billion.[336][337] India is among the top 12 biotech destinations in the world.[338][339] The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012–2013, increasing its revenues from ₹204.4 billion (Indian rupees) to ₹235.24 billion (US$3.94 billion at June 2013 exchange rates).[340]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Energy in India and Energy policy of India\n\nIndia's capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable.[341] The country's usage of coal is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions by India but its renewable energy is competing strongly.[342] India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average.[343][344] Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India.[345]\n\n\n\n### Socio-economic challenges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nHealth workers about to begin another day of immunisation against infectious diseases in 2006. Eight years later, and three years after India's last case of polio, the World Health Organization declared India to be polio-free.[346]\n\nDespite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day.[347] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005.[348] Under the World Bank's later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011.[p][350] 30.7% of India's children under the age of five are underweight.[351] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished.[352][353] The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates.[354]\n\n\nA 2018 Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8 million people in India were living in different forms of modern slavery, such as bonded labour, child labour, human trafficking, and forced begging, among others.[355] According to the 2011 census, there were 10.1 million child labourers in the country, a decline of 2.6 million from 12.6 million in 2001.[356]\n\n\nSince 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.[357] Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100, an improvement from 85th in 2014.[358][359]\n\n\nEpidemic and pandemic diseases have long been a major factor, including COVID-19 recently.[360]\n\n\n\n## Demographics, languages and religion[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of India, Languages of India, and Religion in India\n\nSee also: South Asian ethnic groups\n\nIndia by language\n![](image)\nThe language families of South Asia\n\nWith 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census report,[361] India was the world's second-most populous country.[q] Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011,[363] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991–2001).[363] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males.[361] The median age was 28.7 as of 2020[update].[294] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361 million people.[364] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the \"Green Revolution\" have caused India's population to grow rapidly.[365]\n\n\nThe life expectancy in India is at 70 years—71.5 years for women, 68.7 years for men.[294] There are around 93 physicians per 100,000 people.[366] Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India's recent history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[367] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas.[368][369] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[370] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[371] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males.[372] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas.[370] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.[372]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe interior of San Thome Basilica, Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Christianity is believed to have been introduced to India by the late 2nd century by Syriac-speaking Christians.\n\nAmong speakers of the Indian languages, 74% speak Indo-Aryan languages, the easternmost branch of the Indo-European languages; 24% speak Dravidian languages, indigenous to South Asia and spoken widely before the spread of Indo-Aryan languages and 2% speak Austroasiatic languages or the Sino-Tibetan languages. India has no national language.[373] Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government.[374][375] English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a \"subsidiary official language\";[6] it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 \"scheduled languages\".\n\n\nThe 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others[r] (0.9%).[12] India has the third-largest Muslim population—the largest for a non-Muslim majority country.[376][377]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of India\n\n![](image)\nA Sikh pilgrim at the Harmandir Sahib, or Golden Temple, in Amritsar, Punjab\n\nIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[378] During the Vedic period (c. 1700 BCE – c. 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as *dhárma*, *kárma*, *yóga*, and *mokṣa*, were established.[75] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions.[379] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the *Upanishads*,[380] the *Yoga Sutras*, the *Bhakti* movement,[379] and by Buddhist philosophy.[381]\n\n\n\n### Visual art[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian art\n\nIndia has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[382] Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The \"Pashupati\" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known.[383][384] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[384][385] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[386][387][388] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[389] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing *prana* (\"breath\" or life-force).[390][391] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[392][393]\n\n\nMost of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[394] or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[395][396] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[397] Gupta art, at its peak c. 300 CE – c. 500 CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[398][399] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c. 800 CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[400] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[401][402]\n\n\nAncient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[403][404] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings.[405] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[406][407] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh.[408][409] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[410][411] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.[412][413]\n\n\n\n* ![Bhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd century CE](image)\n\nBhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd century CE\n* ![Gupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century](image)\n\nGupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century\n* ![Elephanta Caves, triple-bust (trimurti) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5 m) tall, c. 550](image)\n\nElephanta Caves, triple-bust (*trimurti*) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5 m) tall, c. 550\n* ![Chola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century](image)\n\nChola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century\n* ![Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign, Balchand, c. 1635](image)\n\n*Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign*, Balchand, c. 1635\n* ![Krishna Fluting to the Milkmaids, Kangra painting, 1775–1785](image)\n\n*Krishna Fluting to the Milkmaids*, Kangra painting, 1775–1785\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of India\n\n![](image)\nThe Taj Mahal from across the Yamuna river showing two outlying red sandstone buildings, a mosque on the right (west) and a *jawab* (response) thought to have been built for architectural balance\n\nMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[414] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours. *Vastu shastra*, literally \"science of construction\" or \"architecture\" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[415] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[416] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.[417] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the *Shilpa Shastras*, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the *Vastu-Purusha mandala*, a square that embodied the \"absolute\".[418] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\".[419] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.[420]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian literature\n\nThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500 BCE and 1200 CE, was in the Sanskrit language.[421] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the *Rigveda* (c. 1500 BCE – c. 1200 BCE), the epics: *Mahābhārata* (c. 400 BCE – c. 400 CE) and the *Ramayana* (c. 300 BCE and later); *Abhijñānaśākuntalam* (*The Recognition of Śakuntalā*, and other dramas of Kālidāsa (c. 5th century CE) and *Mahākāvya* poetry.[422][423][424] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c. 600 BCE – c. 300 BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[425][426][427][428] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.[429] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore,[430] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n\n\n### Performing arts and media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of India, Dance in India, Cinema of India, and Television in India\n\n![](image)\nIndia's National Academy of Performance Arts has recognised eight Indian dance styles to be *classical*. One such is Kuchipudi shown here.\n\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and the southern Carnatic schools.[431] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the *bauls* is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: *bhangra* of Punjab, *bihu* of Assam, *Jhumair* and *chhau* of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, *garba* and *dandiya* of Gujarat, *ghoomar* of Rajasthan, and *lavani* of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: *bharatanatyam* of the state of Tamil Nadu, *kathak* of Uttar Pradesh, *kathakali* and *mohiniyattam* of Kerala, *kuchipudi* of Andhra Pradesh, *manipuri* of Manipur, *odissi* of Odisha, and the *sattriya* of Assam.[432]\n\n\nTheatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[433] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the *bhavai* of Gujarat, the *jatra* of West Bengal, the *nautanki* and *ramlila* of North India, *tamasha* of Maharashtra, *burrakatha* of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, *terukkuttu* of Tamil Nadu, and the *yakshagana* of Karnataka.[434] India has a theatre training institute the National School of Drama (NSD) that is situated at New Delhi. It is an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of culture, Government of India.[435]\nThe Indian film industry produces the world's most-watched cinema.[436] Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages.[437] The Hindi language film industry (*Bollywood*) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue, followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined.[438]\n\n\nTelevision broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades.[439][440] The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society.[441] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012[update] there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462 million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press (350 million), radio (156 million) or internet (37 million).[442]\n\n\n\n### Society[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nMuslims offer *namaz* at a mosque in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nTraditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as *jātis*, or \"castes\".[443] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.\n\n\nFamily values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[444] An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders.[445] Marriage is thought to be for life,[445] and the divorce rate is extremely low,[446] with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[447] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[448] Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period, and constituting 20 percent of India's female electorate.[449] According to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care.[450] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society.[451] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[452] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[453]\n\n\nMany Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[454][455]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in India, Literacy in India, and History of education in the Indian subcontinent\n\n![](image)Children awaiting school lunch in Rayka (also Raika), a village in rural Gujarat. The salutation *Jai Bhim* written on the blackboard honours the jurist, social reformer, and Dalit leader B. R. Ambedkar.\nIn the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[456][457] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.[458]\n\n\nThe education system of India is the world's second-largest.[459] India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[460] and 1.5 million schools.[461] In India's higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[462][463]\n\n\n\n### Clothing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Clothing in India\n\n![](image)\nWomen in sari at an adult literacy class in Tamil Nadu\n![](image)\nA man in dhoti and wearing a woollen shawl, in Varanasi\n\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped.[464] For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long.[464] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder.[464] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end—passing over the shoulder—serving to cover the midriff and obscure the upper body's contours.[464] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[465]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nWomen (from left to right) in churidars and kameez (with back to the camera), jeans and sweater, and pink shalwar kameez\n\nThe use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (c. 1300 CE) and then continued by the Mughal Empire (c. 1525 CE).[466] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[466] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[466]\n\n\nShalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[467] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[468] its side seams left open below the waist-line.[469] The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer's knees.[470]\n\n\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[471] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[471] In white-collar office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[471] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear bandgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[471] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[472]\nis seldom seen in the cities.[471]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian cuisine\n\n![](image)\nSouth Indian vegetarian thali, or platter\n![](image)\nRailway mutton curry from Odisha\n\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[473] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread made from wheat flour, or occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry;[474] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake, or dosa, a griddled pancake, both leavened and made from a batter of rice- and gram meal.[475] The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions.[473] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking.[476]\n\n\nA platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments, which are often served in small bowls. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables or lentils.[473]\n\n\n\nA tandoor chef in the Turkman Gate, Old Delhi, makes Khameeri roti (a Muslim-influenced style of leavened bread).[477]\nIndia has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[478] The appearance of *ahimsa*, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India's Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as among Jains.[478] Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[479] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.[480]\n\n\nThe most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf,[481] developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[482] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[483] To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India.[483] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become the Indian biryani,[483] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[484] In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken—cooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from Central Asia—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition of India.[478]\n\n\n\n### Sports and recreation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in India\n\n![](image)\nGirls play hopscotch in Jaora, Madhya Pradesh. Hopscotch has been commonly played by girls in rural India.[485]\n\nSeveral traditional indigenous sports such as *kabaddi*, *kho kho*, *pehlwani* and *gilli-danda*, and also martial arts such as *Kalarippayattu* and *marma adi*, remain popular. Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as *chaturaṅga*;[486] in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters.[487] Viswanathan Anand became the Chess World Champion in 2007 and held the status until 2013.

(The Rigveda) consists of 1,028 hymns (suktas), highly crafted poetic compositions originally intended for recital during rituals and for the invocation of and communication with the Indo-Aryan gods.

It is known from internal evidence that the Vedic texts were orally composed in northern India, at first in the Greater Punjab and later on also in more eastern areas, including northern Bihar, between ca. 1500 BCE and ca. 500–400 BCE. The oldest text, the Rgveda, must have been more or less contemporary with the Mitanni texts of northern Syria/Iraq (1450–1350 BCE); ... The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalised early on. This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is in fact something of a *tape-recording* of ca. 1500–500 BCE. Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present. (pp. 68–69) ...

The culture is called Aryan, and evidence in its texts indicates that it spread slowly south-east, following the course of the Yamuna and Ganga Rivers. Its elite called itself Arya (pure) and distinguished themselves sharply from others. Aryans led kin groups organized as nomadic horse-herding tribes. Their ritual texts are called Vedas, composed in Sanskrit. Vedic Sanskrit is recorded only in hymns that were part of Vedic rituals to Aryan gods. To be Aryan apparently meant to belong to the elite among pastoral tribes. Texts that record Aryan culture are not precisely datable, but they seem to begin around 1200 BCE with four collections of Vedic hymns (Rg, Sama, Yajur, and Artharva).\"\n  \n(d) Dyson 2018, pp. 14–15, \"Although the collapse of the Indus valley civilization is no longer believed to have been due to an 'Aryan invasion' it is widely thought that, at roughly the same time, or perhaps a few centuries later, new Indo-Aryan-speaking people and influences began to enter the subcontinent from the north-west. Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, a predecessor of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of these languages belonged to the Indo-European language family. ... It seems likely that various small-scale migrations were involved in the gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics. However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the one hand, and changes in language and culture on the other. Moreover, the process whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose—a people with a distinct ideology who eventually seem to have referred to themselves as 'Arya'—was certainly two-way. That is, it involved a blending of new features which came from outside with other features—probably including some surviving Harappan influences—that were already present. Anyhow, it would be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and stories of the Arya people—especially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and Ramayana epics—are poor guides as to historical events. Of course, the emerging Arya were to have a huge impact on the history of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, little is known about their early presence.\";   \n (e) Robb 2011, pp. 46–, \"The expansion of Aryan culture is supposed to have begun around 1500 BCE. It should not be thought that this Aryan emergence (though it implies some migration) necessarily meant either a sudden invasion of new peoples, or a complete break with earlier traditions.

Most other rituals have lost their popularity, are combined with other rites of passage, or are drastically shortened.

As they put into place laws designed to restrict the return of partition emigrants, this produced new dilemmas for both new nations in their treatment of 'overseas Indians'; and many of them lost their right to return to their places of origin in the subcontinent, and also their claims to full citizenship in host countries.\n58. **^** Talbot, Ian; Singh, Gurharpal (2009), *The Partition of India*, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-85661-4, archived from the original on 13 December 2016, retrieved 15 November 2015, When the British divided and quit India in August 1947, they not only partitioned the subcontinent with the emergence of the two nations of India and Pakistan but also the provinces of Punjab and Bengal. ...

They heard about it on the radio, from relations and friends, by reading newspapers and, later, through government pamphlets. Among a population of almost four hundred million, where the vast majority live in the countryside, ploughing the land as landless peasants or sharecroppers, it is hardly surprising that many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, did not hear the news for many weeks afterwards. For some, the butchery and forced relocation of the summer months of 1947 may have been the first that they knew about the creation of the two new states rising from the fragmentary and terminally weakened British empire in India\n60. **^** (a) Copland 2001, pp. 71–78;  \n(b) Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, p. 222.\n61. **^** Dyson 2018, pp. 219, 262\n62. **^** Fisher 2018, p. 8\n63. **^** Metcalf & Metcalf 2012, pp. 265–266\n64. **^** Kumar, Hari; Travelli, Alex; Mashal, Mujib; Chang, Kenneth (23 August 2023), \"'India Is on the Moon': Lander's Success Moves Nation to Next Space Chapter\", *The New York Times*, Two visitors from India — a lander named Vikram and a rover named Pragyan — landed in the southern polar region of the moon on Wednesday.

The term Hindu originated as a geographical term and did not refer to a religion. Later, Hindu was taken by European languages from the Arabic term al-Hind, which referred to the people who lived across the Indus River. This Arabic term was itself taken from the Persian term Hindū, which refers to all Indians. By the 13th century, Hindustan emerged as a popular alternative name for India, meaning the \"land of Hindus.\"\n82. **^** \"Hindustan\", *Encyclopædia Britannica*, retrieved 17 July 2011\n83. **^** Lowe, John J.

The PLA's decisive victories in the 1962 war not only humiliated the Indian Army, they also entrenched a status quo in Ladakh that was highly unfavourable for India, in which China controls almost all of the disputed territory. A nationalistic press and commentariat have kept 1962 vivid in India's popular consciousness.\n  \n(c) Lintner, Bertil (2018), *China's India War: Collision Course on the Roof of the World*, Oxford University Press, ISBN 978-0-19-909163-8, Lin Biao was put in charge of the operation and that alliance between Mao and his loyal de facto chief of the PLA made the attack on India possible.

The outcome of this conflict had far-reaching consequences for Indian foreign and defence policies. The harsh defeat that the Chinese PLA had inflicted on the Indian Army called into question some of the most deeply held precepts of Nehru's foreign and defence policies.\n  \n(f) Raghavan, Srinath (2019), \"A Missed Opportunity? The Nehru-Zhou Enlai Summit of 1960\", in Bhagavan, Manu (ed.), *India and the Cold War*, University of North Carolina Press, p. 121, ISBN 978-1-4696-5117-0, The 'forward policy' adopted by India to prevent the Chinese from occupying territory claimed by them was undertaken in the mistaken belief that Beijing would be cautious in dealing with India owing to Moscow's stance on the dispute and its growing proximity to India. These misjudgments would eventually culminate in India's humiliating defeat in the war of October–November 1962.\n272. **^** Brahma Chellaney (2006). *Asian Juggernaut: The Rise of China, India, and Japan*.

In the last 50 years of Indian democracy, the absolute number of missing women has increased fourfold from 15 million to 68 million. This is not merely a reflection of the growth in the overall population, but, rather, of the fact that this dangerous trend has worsened with time. As a percentage of the female electorate, missing women have gone up significantly — from 13 per cent to approximately 20 per cent\n450. **^** \"More than 63 million women 'missing' in India, statistics show\". *Associated Press via The Guardian*. 30 January 2018. Retrieved 17 November 2019. Quote: \"More than 63 million women are \"missing\" statistically across India, and more than 21 million girls are unwanted by their families, government officials say. The skewed ratio of men to women is largely the result of sex-selective abortions, and better nutrition and medical care for boys, according to the government's annual economic survey, which was released on Monday. In addition, the survey found that \"families where a son is born are more likely to stop having children than families where a girl is born\".\n451. **^** Trivedi, Ira (15 August 2019). \"A Generation of Girls Is Missing in India – Sex-selective abortion fuels a cycle of patriarchy and abuse\". *Foreign Policy*.

In this manner, Central Asian cooking merged with older traditions within the subcontinent, to create such signature dishes as biryani (a fusion of the Persian pilau and the spice-laden dishes of Hindustan), and the Kashmiri meat stew of Rogan Josh. It not only generated new dishes and entire cuisines, but also fostered novel modes of eating. Such newer trends included the consumption of Persian condiments, which relied heavily on almonds, pastries and quince jams, alongside Indian achars made from sweet limes, green vegetables and curds as side relishes during Mughlai meals.\n477. **^** Panjabi, Camellia (1995), *The Great Curries of India*, Simon and Schuster, pp. 158–, ISBN 978-0-684-80383-8, The Muslim influenced breads of India are leavened, like *naan*, *Khamiri roti*, ...\n478. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Davidson, Alan (2014), *The Oxford Companion to Food*, Oxford University Press, p. 410, ISBN 978-0-19-967733-7\n479. **^** Sahakian, Marlyne; Saloma, Czarina; Erkman, Suren (2016), *Food Consumption in the City: Practices and patterns in urban Asia and the Pacific*, Taylor & Francis, p. 50, ISBN 978-1-317-31050-1\n480. **^** OECD; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2018), *OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2018–2027*, OECD Publishing, p. 21, ISBN 978-92-64-06203-0\n481. **^** Roger 2000.\n482. **^** Sengupta, Jayanta (2014), \"India\", in Freedman, Paul; Chaplin, Joyce E.; Albala, Ken (eds.), *Food in Time and Place: The American Historical Association Companion to Food History*, University of California Press, p. 74, ISBN 978-0-520-27745-8\n483. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Collingham, Elizabeth M.

It is the world's third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations.[j] With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous country in the Americas and the third-most populous in the world. The national capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and principal financial center is New York City.\n\n\nIndigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years. Beginning in 1607, British colonization led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States. They clashed with the British Crown over taxation and political representation, which led to the American Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary War. The United States declared independence on July 4, 1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and liberal democracy. The country began expanding across North America, spanning the continent by 1848. Sectional division over slavery (primarily of Africans) led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861–1865). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. However, racial discrimination and inequality continued into subsequent centuries. By 1900, the United States had established itself as a great power, becoming the world's largest economy. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the side of the Allies. The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence but avoided direct military conflict. During the Space Race, the United States landed the first humans on the Moon, notably with the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower.\n\n\nThe United States government is a federal presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction which may not conflict with the Constitution.[26][27] The U.S. ranks very highly in international measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption. It has higher levels of incarceration and inequality than most other liberal democracies and is the only liberal democracy without universal healthcare. As a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the U.S. has been extensively shaped by the world's largest immigrant population.\n\n\nHighly developed, the U.S. has by far the largest amount of wealth of any country. The American economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP and is the world's largest by nominal GDP. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter, as well as the largest consumer market. It is a founding member of the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, NATO and WHO, and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is the world's foremost political, cultural, economic, military, and scientific power.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of the United States and Demonyms for the United States\n\nThe first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his desire to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[28][29][30] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in *The Virginia Gazette* newspaper in Williamsburg, on April 6, 1776.[31]\n\n\nBy June 1776, the name \"United States of America\" appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, authored by John Dickinson, a Founding Father from the Province of Pennsylvania,[32][33] and in the Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776.[32]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States\n\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of United States history.\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Native Americans in the United States and Pre-Columbian era\n\n![](image)Cliff Palace, located in present-day Colorado, was built by Ancestral Puebloans.\nThe first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia across the Bering land bridge at least 12,000 years ago; some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.[34][35][36] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000BC, is believed to represent the first widespread culture in the Americas.[37][38] The Clovis culture was replaced by several more localized regional societies from the Younger Dryas cold-climate period onward.[39]\n\n\nOver time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[40] The city-state of Cahokia was the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in present-day United States.[41] In the Four Corners region in present-day Southwestern United States, the culture of Ancestral Puebloans developed over centuries of agricultural experimentation.[42] The Algonquian were historically prominent along the Atlantic Coast and in the Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes regions. Before European immigrants made contact, most of the Algonquian relied on hunting and fishing, and many supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans, and squash, known as the \"Three Sisters\". By the time of European contact in the 17th century, they practiced slash and burn agriculture, using controlled fire to extend farmlands' productivity and manage land.[43][44][45][46][47][48] The Ojibwe cultivated wild rice.[49] The Iroquois confederation Haudenosaunee, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established between the 12th and 15th centuries.[50] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants[51][52] range from around 500,000[53][51] to nearly 10 million.[51][52]\n\n\n\n### Colonization (1492–1763)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colonial history of the United States\n\n![](image)British North America in 1775 with the 13 colonies shown in red\nChristopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean in 1492, and Spain soon established Spanish Florida on the mainland.[54][55] \nThe Spanish Empire set up their first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, including in Saint Augustine (1565), which is often considered the nation's oldest city,[56] and Santa Fe (1598). The Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, sent by France to the New World in 1525, encountered Native American inhabitants in the present-day New York Bay region.[57] The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico, including in New Orleans (1718) and Mobile (1702).[58]\nBritish colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and Plymouth Colony (1620).[59][60] Many English settlers were dissenting Christians who fled England seeking religious freedom.[61] The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[62][63]\n\n\nDuring 17th-century European colonization, settlers experienced food shortages, disease, and conflicts with Native Americans, particularly in King Philip's War, but often came to develop a mutual dependency. Settlers traded guns, tools, and European goods for food and animal pelts.[64] Native Americans taught settlers to cultivate local foods. Colonial authorities often pursued policies to to \"civilize\" the Native Americans and urge or force them to adopt European lifestyles.[65][66] The native population of America declined after European arrival,[67][68][69] primarily as a result of infectious diseases brought from Europe such as smallpox and measles,[70][71] and native peoples were displaced by European expansion.[72]\n\n\nEuropean settlers trafficked African slaves into the colonial United States via the transatlantic slave trade.[73] By the turn of the 18th century, slavery supplanted indentured servitude as the main source of agricultural labor for the cash crops in the Southern Colonies.[74] Southern tobacco colonies passed laws designed to keep African Americans subservient.[75][76][77]\n\n\nThe original Thirteen Colonies[l] were administered by Great Britain.[78] All colonies had local governments with elections open to white male property owners except Jews and, in some areas, Catholics.[79][80] With very high birth rates, low death rates, and steadily growing settlements, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations.[81] By the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[82] The colonies' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance, [83] and the First Great Awakening—a series of Christian revivals—fueled colonial interest in religious liberty.[84]\n\n\n\n### Revolution and the new nation (1763–1789)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1776–1789)\n\nFurther information: American Enlightenment\n\n![See caption](image)*Declaration of Independence*, a portrait by John Trumbull depicting the Committee of Five presenting the draft of the Declaration to the Continental Congress on June 28, 1776, in Philadelphia\nAfter the British victory in the French and Indian War, won largely through the support from the colonies, the British began to assert greater control in local colonial affairs, fomenting colonial political resistance. In 1774, to demonstrate colonial dissatisfaction with the lack of representation in the British government that extracted taxes from them, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia and passed the Continental Association, which mandated a colonies-wide boycott of British goods. The British attempted to disarm the Americans, resulting in the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and charged a committee led by Thomas Jefferson with writing a Declaration of Independence.[85]\n\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, which famously stated: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" The adoption of the Declaration of Independence is celebrated annually on July 4 in the United States as Independence Day.[86] After the surrender of a second British Army at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty gained international recognition, and the new nation took possession of substantial territory east of the Mississippi River, from what is present-day Canada in the north to Florida in the south.[87] Washington resigned his commission, returned to private life, and the Continental Army was disbanded. \n\n\n\n![](image)*The Old Plantation*, a c. 1790 painting of a plantation by a South Carolina slaveholder\nRatified by the states in 1781 and based on the concept of \"consent of the governed\", the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[86] Considered one of the most important legislative acts of the Confederation Congress,[88] the Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the national government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states.[89] The prohibition of slavery in the Northwest Territory had the practical effect of establishing the Ohio River as an extension of the Mason–Dixon line, the geographic and political divide between slave states and free states.[90][91]\n\n\nAs it became increasingly apparent that the Confederation was insufficient to govern the new country, nationalists advocated for and led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, where the United States Constitution was drafted. The U.S. Constitution is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force today.[92] Ratified by the states, it went into effect in 1789, reorganizing the government into a federation administered by three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative), on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. George Washington was elected the nation's first President under the new constitution and returned to public life. The Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay concerns by sceptics of the more centralized national government.[93][94]\n\n\n\n### Expansion (1789–1860)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1789–1849)\n ![](image)Animated map of the territorial evolution of the United States (click to view full size image)\nDuring the colonial period, slavery was legal in the American colonies. However, during the American Revolution, many began to question the practice.[95] Founding Fathers in the northern United States advocated for the abolition of slavery, and slavery was abolished in Northern states.[96] The increased profitability for southern elites after the cotton gin lowered production costs entrenched support for slavery in the southern United States.[97][98][99]\n\n\nIn the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, with a sense of manifest destiny.[100] The Louisiana Purchase (1803) nearly doubled the territory of the United States, and effectively ended French opposition to America's westward expansion.[101] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a virtual draw but established the United States as capable of defending itself.[102] Spain ceded Florida and their Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[103] The Missouri Compromise (1820) admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, dividing the country into free states, which forbade slavery, and slave states, which protected the institution.[104] [105]\n\n\nAs Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[106][107] The displacement prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River.[108][109] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[105] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[110] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, resulting in the U.S. stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans.[100][111]\n\n\n\n### Civil War and Reconstruction (1860–1876)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1849–1865) and 1865–1918\n\n![](image)Division of the states during the American Civil War\n * Union states\n* Border states\n* Confederate states\n* Territories\nSectional conflict regarding slavery[112] culminated in the American Civil War.[113] Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the remaining states (the Union) maintained that secession was unconstitutional and illegitimate.[114] On April 12, 1861, the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter, a federal garrison in Charleston, South Carolina. The ensuing Civil War (1861–1865) became the deadliest military conflict in American history.[115] In 1863, the Civil War began to turn in the Union's favor following the Siege of Vicksburg led by General Ulysses S. Grant, which gave them control of the Mississippi River, and the Battle of Gettysburg, where the Union Army halted Confederate Army general Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North. In April 1865, following the Union Army's victory at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, the Confederacy surrendered.[116]\n\n\n![](image)Sketch of Chinese railroad workers on the Central Pacific Railroad, 1870\nThe Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Radical Republicans passed the Reconstruction Amendments to ensure the rights of African Americans. The biracial Southern governments were opposed by terrorist and paramilitary organizations. To encourage additional westward settlement the Homestead Acts allowed an applicant to acquire ownership of government land, by residing there. More than 160 million acres (650 thousand km2; 250 thousand sq mi)—nearly 10 percent of the total area of the United States—were given away free to 1.6 million homesteaders. The Southern Homestead Act of 1866 was enacted to break a cycle of debt during Reconstruction. This act attempted to sell land at low prices so marginalized Southerners could buy it, but many were still too poor to afford the lower prices.[117] National infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred growth in the American Old West. New transcontinental railways made relocation easier, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[118]\n\n\n\n### Development of the modern United States (1876–1914)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1865–1918)\n\n![](image)An October 24th, 1874 Harper's Magazine editorial cartoon by Thomas Nast denouncing Ku Klux Klan and White League murders of African Americans\nThe Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[119][120] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[121] From 1890 to 1910, the Southern States established Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising almost all African Americans. Racial segregation was prevalent nationwide and discrimination was codified, especially in the South,[122] while well into the 20th century lynching and other forms of unjustified vigilante violence often went unprosecuted.[123][124]\n\n\nTerritorial expansion continued apace. Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[125] Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain following the Spanish–American War.[126] Puerto Ricans did not gain citizenship either through the Foraker Act (1900) or the Insular Cases (1901), but through the Jones–Shafroth Act in 1917,[127] allowing for the conscription of 20,000 Puerto Ricans, which began two months later.[128] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War.[129] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[130]\n\n\n\nAn Edison Studios film showing immigrants arriving at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, a major point of entry for European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries[131][132]\nFrom 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe including Great Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, Russia, and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.[133] Most came through the port of New York City, and from 1892 specifically through the now iconic Ellis Island. New York and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[134] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[135]\n\n\nRapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[136] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, and the United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[137] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, which prompted the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[138][139][140] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[141]\n\n\n\n### World Wars period (1914–1945)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1918–1945)\n\n![](image)The Trinity nuclear test in the Jornada del Muerto desert on July 16, 1945, part of the Manhattan Project and the first detonation of a nuclear weapon\nThe early 20th century was a time of industrial expansion and social change in the United States.[142][143] The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.[144] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage.[145] During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for mass communication and ultimately the invention of early television transformed communications in the United States.[146] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to with New Deal social and economic policies.[147][148]\n\n\nAt first neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.[149][150] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them again the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war.[151][152] The United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\" who met to plan the postwar world, alongside the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China.[153][154] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic and military influence.[155]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary United States (1945–present)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1945–1964), 1964–1980, 1980–1991, and 1991–2008\n\n![See caption](image)Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963.\nAfter World War II, the United States entered the Cold War, where geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union led the two countries to dominate the affairs of other countries.[156] The U.S. engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with the Soviet Union, and competed in the Space Race, culminating in the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.[157][158][159][160][161] Domestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following World War II.[162]\n\n\nThe civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s.[163] The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes towards what substances are acceptable for recreational drug use, sexuality[164][165] and the beginning of the modern gay rights movement as well as open defiance of the military draft and opposition to intervention in Vietnam.[166] The presidency of Richard Nixon saw the American withdrawal from Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, which led to a decline in public trust in government.[167]\n\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s saw economic stagflation and President Ronald Reagan responded with neoliberal reforms and a rollback strategy towards the Soviet Union.[168][169][170][171] By 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[172] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War and solidified the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.[173][174][175][176]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Twin Towers in New York City during the September 11 attacks, 2001\nIn the first decades of the 21st century, the U.S. faced challenges from terrorism, with the September 11 attacks in 2001 leading to the war on terror and military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.[177][178] The U.S. housing bubble in 2006 culminated in the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[179] Amid the financial crisis, Barack Obama, the first multiracial president, was elected in 2008.[180][181]\n\n\nPolitical polarization increased as sociopolitical debates on cultural issues dominated political discussion.[182] The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in over 100 million confirmed cases and 1 million deaths,[183] making it the most deadly pandemic in U.S. history.[184] Attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election culminated in the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol that attempted to prevent the peaceful transition of power.[185]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of the United States\n\n![](image)A topographic map of the United States\nThe United States is the world's third-largest nation by land and total area behind Russia and Canada.[c][186][187] The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km2).[188][189] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region.[190]\n\n\nThe Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[191] The Mississippi River System—the world's fourth longest river system—runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[191]\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[192] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts.[193] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[194] about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[195] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and continent.[196] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[197]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Köppen climate types of the United States\nMain articles: Climate of the United States and Climate change in the United States\n\nWith its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types. East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[198] The western Great Plains are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[199]\n\n\nStates bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley.[200] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country.[201] Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. In the American Southwest, droughts became more persistent and more severe.[202]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States\n\n![A bald eagle](image)The bald eagle, the national bird of the United States since 1782[203]\nThe U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[204] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, 295 amphibians,[205] and 91,000 insect species.[206]\n\n\nThere are 63 national parks, and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas, managed by the National Park Service and other agencies.[207] About 28% of the country's land is publicly owned and federally managed,[208] primarily in the western states.[209] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for industrial use, and less than one percent is used for military purposes.[210][211]\n\n\nEnvironmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, biological diversity, logging and deforestation,[212][213] and climate change.[214][215] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency charged with addressing most environmental-related issues.[216] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[217] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a way to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service implements and enforces the Act.[218] As of 2020, the U.S. ranked 24th among 180 nations in the Environmental Performance Index.[219] The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and has many other environmental commitments.[220]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Constitution of the United States, Politics of the United States, and Government of the United States\n\nFurther information: Political parties in the United States, Elections in the United States, Political ideologies in the United States, American patriotism, and American civil religion\n\n![](image)The Capitol and its two legislative chambers, the Senate (left) and the House of Representatives (right)\n![](image)The White House, the residence and workplace of the U.S. President and the offices of the presidential staff\n![](image)The Supreme Court Building, which houses the nation's highest court\nThe United States was founded on the principles of the American Enlightenment.

The House of Representatives has 435 members from single member congressional districts allocated to each state on the basis of population, elected for a two-year term.\n* The U.S. President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies through their respective agencies.[229] The president and the vice president are elected together in a presidential election.[230] It is an indirect election, with the winner being determined by votes cast by electors of the Electoral College. The President and Vice President serve a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice.\n* The U.S. federal judiciary, whose judges are all appointed for life by the President with Senate approval, consists primarily of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. District Courts. The U.S. Supreme Court interprets laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[231] The Supreme Court is led by the chief justice of the United States. It has nine members who serve for life.

People in the states are also represented by local elected governments, which are administrative divisions of the states. States are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington.[233] The territories and the District of Columbia are administrative divisions of the federal government.[234]\n\n![](image)\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States\n\n![see caption](image)The United Nations headquarters has been situated along the East River in Midtown Manhattan since 1952; in 1945, the United States was a founding member of the UN.\nThe United States has an established structure of foreign relations, and it had the world's second-largest diplomatic corps in 2019.[235] It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,[236] and home to the United Nations headquarters.[237] The United States is a member of the G7,[238] G20,[239] and OECD intergovernmental organizations.[240] Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran,[241] North Korea,[242] and Bhutan.[243] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations.[244] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[245]\n\n\nThe United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom[246] and strong ties with Canada,[247] Australia,[248] New Zealand,[249] the Philippines,[250] Japan,[251] South Korea,[252] Israel,[253] and several European Union countries (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland).[254] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with nations in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United States–Mexico–Canada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States.[255] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[256] It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with India,[257] and its ties with China have steadily deteriorated.[258][259] Since 2014, the U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine.[260][261]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Armed Forces and Military history of the United States\n\n![](image)The Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense\nThe President is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Department of Defense, which is headquartered at the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., administers five of the six service branches, which are made up of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force. The Coast Guard is administered by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and can be transferred to the Department of the Navy in wartime.[262]\n\n\nThe United States spent $877 billion on its military in 2022, which is by far the largest amount of any country, making up 39% of global military spending and accounting for 3.5% of the country's GDP.***[263]***[264] The U.S. has more than 40% of the world's nuclear weapons, the second-largest amount after Russia.[265]\n\n\nThe United States has the third-largest combined armed forces in the world, behind the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Indian Armed Forces.[266] The military operates about 800 bases and facilities abroad,[267] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[268]\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement and crime[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law enforcement in the United States, Crime in the United States, and Censorship in the United States\n\n![](image)J. Edgar Hoover Building, the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nThere are about 18,000 U.S. police agencies from local to federal level in the United States.[269] Law in the United States is mainly enforced by local police departments and sheriff departments in their municipal or county jurisdictions. The state police departments have authority in their respective state, and federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have national jurisdiction and specialized duties, such as protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws.[270] State courts conduct most civil and criminal trials,[271] and federal courts handle designated crimes and appeals of state court decisions.[272]\n\n\nAs of January 2023, the United States has the sixth highest per-capita incarceration rate in the world, at 531 people per 100,000; and the largest prison and jail population in the world with almost 2 million people incarcerated.[273][274][275] A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States homicide rates \"were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher.\"[276]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of the United States\n\nFurther information: Economic history of the United States and Tourism in the United States\n\n![see caption](image)The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and is the world's foremost reserve currency.[277]\n![](image)The New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street, the world's largest stock exchange by market capitalization[278]\n![](image)Apple Park, in Cupertino, California, within Silicon Valley, is the headquarters of Apple Inc., the world's biggest company by market capitalization.[279]\nThe U.S. has been the world's largest economy since at least 1900.[280] The U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) of $25.5 trillion is the largest of any country in the world, constituting over 25% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 15% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).[281][13] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the Group of Seven.[282] The country ranks first in the world by disposable income per capita, nominal GDP,[283] second by GDP (PPP),[13] seventh by nominal GDP per capita,[281] and eighth by GDP (PPP) per capita.[13]\n\n\nOf the world's 500 largest companies, 136 are headquartered in the U.S.[284] The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and is the world's foremost reserve currency, backed by the country's dominant economy, its military, the petrodollar system, and its linked eurodollar and large U.S. treasuries market.[277] Several countries use it as their official currency and in others it is the *de facto* currency.[285][286] It has free trade agreements with several countries, including the USMCA.[287] The U.S. ranked second in the Global Competitiveness Report in 2019, after Singapore.[288] While its economy has reached a post-industrial level of development, the United States remains an industrial power.[289] As of 2018, the U.S. is the second-largest manufacturing nation after China.[290] In 2021, the U.S. was both the world's largest exporter and importer of engines.[291]\n\n\nNew York City is the world's principal financial center, with the largest economic output, and the epicenter of the principal American metropolitan economy.[292][293][294] The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, both located in New York City, are the world's two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and trade volume.[295][296] The United States is at or near the forefront of technological advancement and innovation[297] in many economic fields, especially in artificial intelligence; computers; pharmaceuticals; and medical, aerospace and military equipment.[298] The nation's economy is fueled by abundant natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure, and high productivity.[299] It has the second-highest total-estimated value of natural resources after Russia.[300] The largest U.S. trading partners are the European Union, Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, India, and Taiwan.[301] The United States is the world's largest importer and the second-largest exporter after China.[302] It is by far the world's largest exporter of services.[303]\n\n\nAmericans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD member states,[304] and the fourth-highest median household income,[305] up from sixth-highest in 2013.[306] Wealth in the United States is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population own 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom 50% own just 2%.[307] Income inequality in the U.S. remains at record highs,[308] with the top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all income[309] and giving the U.S. one of the widest income distributions among OECD members.[310] The U.S. ranks first in the number of dollar billionaires and millionaires, with 724 billionaires[311] and nearly 22 million millionaires (as of 2021).[312] There were about 582,500 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in 2022, with 60% staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.[313] In 2018 six million children experience food insecurity.[314] Feeding America estimates that around one in seven, or approximately 11 million, children experience hunger and do not know where they will get their next meal or when.[315] As of June 2018,[update] 40 million people, roughly 12.7% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty, including 13.3 million children.[316]\n\n\nThe United States has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than most other high-income countries.[317][318] It is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation nationally[319] and is one of a few countries in the world without federal paid family leave as a legal right.[320] The United States has a higher percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation, largely because of a weak collective bargaining system and lack of government support for at-risk workers.[321]\n\n\n\n### Science, technology, and energy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Science and technology in the United States, Science policy of the United States, Telecommunications in the United States, and Energy in the United States\n\n![](image)U.S. astronaut Buzz Aldrin saluting the flag on the Moon during the 1969 Apollo 11 mission. The United States is the only country that has sent crewed missions to the lunar surface.\nThe United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts and the establishment of a machine tool industry enabled America's large-scale manufacturing of consumer products in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, factory electrification, the introduction of the assembly line, and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production.[322] In 2022, the United States was the country with the second-highest number of published scientific papers.[323] As of 2021, the U.S. ranked second by the number of patent applications, and third by trademark and industrial design applications.[324] In 2022, the United States ranked 3rd in the Global Innovation Index.[325]\n\n\nAs of 2021[update], the United States receives approximately 79.1% of its energy from fossil fuels.[326] In 2021, the largest source of the country's energy came from petroleum (36.1%), followed by natural gas (32.2%), coal (10.8%), renewable sources (12.5%), and nuclear power (8.4%).[326] The United States constitutes less than 5% of the world's population, but consumes 17% of the world's energy.[327][328] The U.S. ranks as the second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases.[329]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in the United States\n\n![](image)Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, serving the Atlanta metropolitan area, is the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic with over 93 million passengers annually in 2022.[330]\nPersonal transportation in the United States is dominated by automobiles,[331][332] which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads, making it the longest network in the world.[333][334] The Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the Ford Model T, both American cars, are considered the first mass-produced[335] and mass-affordable[336] cars, respectively. As of 2022, the United States is the second-largest manufacturer of motor vehicles.[337] Currently, the American automotive industry is the world's second-largest automobile market by sales,[338] and the U.S. has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, [339] with 910 vehicles per 1000 people.[340] The United States's rail network, the longest in the world,[341] handles mostly freight.[342][343]\n\n\nThe American civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[344] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[345] Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the top five and the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.[346][347] As of 2020[update], there are 19,919 airports in the United States, of which 5,217 are designated as \"public use\", including for general aviation and other activities.[348]\n\n\nOf the fifty busiest container ports, four are located in the United States, of which the busiest is the Port of Los Angeles.[349] The country's inland waterways are the world's fifth-longest, and total 41,009 km (25,482 mi).[350]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of the United States\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Americans and Race and ethnicity in the United States\n\nSee also: List of U.S. states by population\n\n![](image)United States population density map based on Census 2010 data\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents as of April 1, 2020,[m][351] making the United States the third-most populous nation in the world, after China and India.[352] According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock, on January 28, 2021, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 100 seconds, or about 864 people per day.[353] In 2018, 52% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 32% had never been married.[354] In 2021, the total fertility rate for the U.S. stood at 1.7 children per woman,[355] and it had the world's highest rate of children (23%) living in single-parent households in 2019.[356]\n\n\nThe United States has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[357] White Americans with ancestry from Europe, the Middle East or North Africa, form the largest racial and ethnic group at 57.8% of the United States population.[358][359] Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and are 18.7% of the United States population. African Americans constitute the nation's third-largest ancestry group and are 12.1% of the total United States population.[357] Asian Americans are the country's fourth-largest group, composing 5.9% of the United States population, while the country's 3.7 million Native Americans account for about 1%.[357] In 2020, the median age of the United States population was 38.5 years.[352]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of the United States\n\n![](image)Most spoken languages in USA\nWhile many languages are spoken in the United States, English is overwhelmingly the most commonly spoken in a majority of the country.[360] Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English, and most states have declared English as the official language.[361] Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English, including Hawaii (Hawaiian),[362] Alaska (twenty Native languages),[n][363] South Dakota (Sioux),[364] American Samoa (Samoan), Puerto Rico (Spanish), Guam (Chamorro), and the Northern Mariana Islands (Carolinian and Chamorro). In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English.[365]\n\n\nAccording to the American Community Survey, in 2010 some 229 million people (out of the total U.S. population of 308 million) spoke only English at home. More than 37 million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (2.8 million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), Korean (1.1 million), and German (1 million).[366]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to the United States\n\nAmerica's immigrant population, numbering more than 50 million, is by far the world's largest in absolute terms.[367][368] In 2022, there were 87.7 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for nearly 27% of the overall U.S. population.[369] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants.[370] In 2019, the top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico (24% of immigrants), India (6%), China (5%), the Philippines (4.5%), and El Salvador (3%).[371] The United States has led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[372]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligious affiliation in USA, per Gallup, Inc.

New England and the Western United States tend to be less religious,[385] although Mormonism—a Restorationist Christian movement started in New York in the 19th century—is the predominant religious affiliation in Utah.[386]\n\n\nAround 6% of Americans claim a non-Christian faith.[387] the largest of which are Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.[388] \"Ceremonial deism\" is common in American culture.[389] Religious belief and interest has remained relatively stable in recent years; organizational participation, in contrast, has decreased.[390] Other notable faiths include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, many New Age movements, and a large variety of Native American religions.[391]\n\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Urbanization in the United States and List of United States cities by population\n\nAbout 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[186] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[392] In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston) had populations exceeding two million.[393] Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[394]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in the United States2023 MSA population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau[395]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region | Pop. |  |\n| ![New York](image)New York![Los Angeles](image)Los Angeles | 1 | New York | Northeast | 19,498,249 | 11 | Boston | Northeast | 4,919,179\n | ![Chicago](image)Chicago![Dallas–Fort Worth](image)Dallas–Fort Worth |\n| 2 | Los Angeles | West | 12,799,100 | 12 | Riverside–San Bernardino | West | 4,688,053\n |\n| 3 | Chicago | Midwest | 9,262,825 | 13 | San Francisco | West | 4,566,961\n |\n| 4 | Dallas–Fort Worth | South | 8,100,037 | 14 | Detroit | Midwest | 4,342,304\n |\n| 5 | Houston | South | 7,510,253 | 15 | Seattle | West | 4,044,837\n |\n| 6 | Atlanta | South | 6,307,261 | 16 | Minneapolis–Saint Paul | Midwest | 3,712,020\n |\n| 7 | Washington, D.C. | South | 6,304,975 | 17 | Tampa–St. Petersburg | South | 3,342,963\n |\n| 8 | Philadelphia | Northeast | 6,246,160 | 18 | San Diego | West | 3,269,973\n |\n| 9 | Miami | South | 6,183,199 | 19 | Denver | West | 3,005,131\n |\n| 10 | Phoenix | West | 5,070,110 | 20 | Baltimore | South | 2,834,316\n |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Healthcare in the United States, Healthcare reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States\n\n![The Texas Medical Center, a cluster of contemporary skyscrapers, at night](image)Texas Medical Center in Houston is the largest medical complex in the world, employing 106,000 people and treating 10 million patients annually as of 2016.[396]\nIn a preliminary report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that U.S. life expectancy at birth was 76.4 years in 2021 (73.2 years for men and 79.1 years for women), down 0.9 years from 2020. The chief causes listed were the COVID-19 pandemic, accidents, drug overdoses, heart and liver disease, and suicides.[397][398] Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among Black and American Indian–Alaskan Native (AIAN) peoples.[399][400] Starting in 1998, the life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since.[401] The U.S. has one of the highest suicide rates among high-income countries.[402] Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight.[403] Poverty is the 4th leading risk factor for premature death in the United States annually, according to a 2023 study published in *JAMA*.[404][405]\n\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system far outspends that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer nations.[406] The United States is the only developed nation without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance.[407]\n\n\nGovernment-funded healthcare coverage for the poor (Medicaid) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA,[o][408] with the law roughly halving the uninsured share of the population according to the CDC.[409] Its legacy remains controversial.[410]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in the United States and Higher education in the United States\n\n![Photograph of the University of Virginia](image)The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of many public colleges and universities in the United States.\nAmerican public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or six (beginning with kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[411] Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[412] The basic literacy rate is near-universal.[186][413] The country has the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 403 (having won 406 awards).[414][415]\n\n\nThe United States has many private and public institutions of higher education including many of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25.[416][417][418] There are local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[419] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world,[420] spending an average of $12,794 per year on public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016–2017 school year.[421]\n\n\nAs for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[422] Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place,[423] student loan debt has increased by 102% in the last decade,[424] and exceeded 1.7 trillion dollars as of 2022.[425]\n\n\n\n## Culture and society[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of the United States and Society of the United States\n\n![The Statue of Liberty, a large teal bronze sculpture on a stone pedestal](image)The Statue of Liberty (*Liberty Enlightening the World*) on Liberty Island in New York Harbor was an 1866 gift from France that has become an iconic symbol of the American Dream.[426]\nAmericans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying political belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.[427][428] Culturally, the country has been described as having the values of individualism and personal autonomy,[429][430] having a strong work ethic,[431] competitiveness,[432] and voluntary altruism towards others.[433][434][435] According to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity, the highest in the world by a large margin.[436] Part of both the Anglosphere and Western World, the United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values,[437][438] and exerts major cultural influence on a global scale,[439][440] with the phenomenon being termed *Americanization*.[441] As such, the U.S. is considered a cultural superpower.[442]\n\n\nNearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Eurafrasia (\"the Old World\") within the past five centuries.[443] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[437][444] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture.[437] The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[445] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[446][447][448][449] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[450] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[451] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[452]\n\n\nThe United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country under the First Amendment,[453] which protects flag desecration, hate speech, blasphemy, and lese-majesty as forms of protected expression.[454][455][456] A 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured.[457] They are the \"most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the Internet without government censorship.\"[458] It is a socially progressive country[459] with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality.[460] LGBT rights in the United States are among the most advanced in the world.[460][461][462]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American literature and American philosophy\n\n![Photograph of Mark Twain](image)Mark Twain, who William Faulkner called \"the father of American literature\"[463]\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of their cues from Europe. Writers such as Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is recognized as an essential American poet.[464]\n\n\nAlmost until the 20th century pervasive anti-literacy laws prevented most people of color from learning to read or write.[465][466] In the 1920s, the New Negro Movement coalesced in Harlem, where many writers had migrated from the Southern United States and West Indies. Its pan-African perspective was a significant cultural export during the Jazz Age in Paris and as such was a key early influence on the *négritude* philosophy.[467]\n\n\nSince its first use in the 19th century, the term \"Great American Novel\" has been applied to many books, including Herman Melville's *Moby-Dick* (1851), Harriet Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* (1852), Twain's *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby* (1925), John Steinbeck's *The Grapes of Wrath* (1939), Harper Lee's *To Kill a Mockingbird* (1960), Toni Morrison's *Beloved* (1987), and David Foster Wallace's *Infinite Jest* (1996).[468][469][470]\n\n\nThirteen U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Louise Glück, Bob Dylan, and Toni Morrison.[471] Earlier laureates William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck have been recognized as influential 20th century writers.[472]\n\n\n\n### Mass media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mass media in the United States\n\nSee also: Newspapers in the United States, Television in the United States, Internet in the United States, Radio in the United States, and Video games in the United States\n\n![](image)Comcast Center in Philadelphia, headquarters of Comcast, the world's largest telecommunications and media conglomerate\nThe four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[473] As of 2021[update], about 83% of Americans over age 12 listen to broadcast radio, while about 41% listen to podcasts.[474] As of September 30, 2014[update], there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[475] Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.[476]\n\n\nGlobally-recognized newspapers in the United States include *The Wall Street Journal*, *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, and *USA Today*.[477] More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[478][479] With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as *The Village Voice* in New York City and *LA Weekly* in Los Angeles. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Amazon, Yahoo, and Facebook, with all of them being American companies.[480]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the video game market of the United States is the world's largest by revenue.[481] Major video game publishers and developers headquartered in the United States are Sony Interactive Entertainment, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda Softworks, Epic Games, Valve, Warner Bros., Riot Games, and others.[482][483] There are 444 publishers, developers, and hardware companies in California alone.[484]\n\n\n\n### Theater[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Theater in the United States\n\n![](image)Broadway theatres in Theater District, Manhattan, New York City\nThe United States is well known for its cinema and theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater.[485] In the 19th century, America had created new dramatic forms in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show.[486]\n\n\nThe central hub of the American theater scene is Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.[487] Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active community theater culture.[488]\n\n\nAlthough earlier styles of theater such as minstrel shows and Vaudeville acts have disappeared from the landscape,[489] theater still remains a popular contemporary American art form. Broadway productions still entertain millions of theatergoers even as productions have become more elaborate and expensive.[490] The Theater District is an internationally prominent tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, for the 2018–19 season total attendance was 14,768,254 and $1,829,312,140 in grosses.[491]\n\n\nThe Tony Awards recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre and are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League[492] at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.[493]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of the United States\n\n![](image)The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee\nAmerican folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, Mainland Europe, or Africa.[494]\n\n\nThe rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have significantly influenced American music at large. The Smithsonian Institution states, \"African-American influences are so fundamental to American music that there would be no American music without them.\"[495] One instrument first mass-produced in the United States was the banjo, which had originally been crafted from gourds covered by animal skins by African slaves.[496][497] Banjos became widely popular in the 19th century due to their use in minstrel shows.[496] Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century.[498]\n\n\nThe United States has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of $4.9 billion in 2014.[499] Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[500] Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the pioneers of rock and roll in the mid-1950s. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing musical acts in worldwide sales.[501][502][503] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters.[504] Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra,[505] and Elvis Presley became global celebrities,[498] as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Prince, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey,[506][507] and of the early 21th century, such as Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, and Lady Gaga.[508] The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States.[509] American professional opera singers have reached the highest level of success in that form, including Renée Fleming, Leontyne Price, Beverly Sills, Nelson Eddy, and many others.[510]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Visual art of the United States and Architecture of the United States\n\n![](image)*Nighthawks* (1942) by Edward Hopper is one of his best-known works, Art Institute of Chicago.\nIn the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[511] Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles, which would become known as American modernism. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.[512]\n\n\nThe uniquely American \"Chicago School\" refers to two architectural styles derived from the architecture of Chicago. In the history of architecture, the first Chicago School was a school of architects active in Chicago in the late 19th, and at the turn of the 20th century. They were among the first to promote the new technologies of steel-frame construction in commercial buildings, and developed a spatial aesthetic which co-evolved with, and then came to influence, parallel developments in European modernism. Much of its early work is known as \"Commercial Style\".[513] A \"Second Chicago School\" with a modernist aesthetic emerged in the 1940s through 1970s, which pioneered new building technologies and structural systems, such as the tube-frame structure.[514] The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[515]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of the United States\n\n![](image)The iconic Hollywood Sign, in the Hollywood Hills, often regarded as the symbol of the American film industry\nThe U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is the leader in motion picture production and the most recognizable movie industry in the world.[516][517][518] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[519][520] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[521] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[522] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[523]\n\n\nDirector D. W. Griffith's film adaptation of *The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan* was the first American blockbuster, earning the equivalent of $1.8 billion in current dollars. The technical achievements of the film revolutionized film grammar, while its subject matter caused both strident protest and a revitalization of the Klan.[524] Producer and entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[525] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[526] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[527][528] In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\"[529] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[530] The 21st century has been marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, and Apple TV+, which came to rival traditional cinema.[531][532]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American cuisine\n\nFurther information: List of American regional and fusion cuisines\n\n![](image)A bacon cheeseburger served with french fries, fried onions and ketchup\nEarly settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour,[533] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[534][535] New World crops, especially corn and potatoes, and the native turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when many Americans make or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[536]\n\n\nCharacteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[537][538][539][540] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[541]\n\n\nThe American fast food industry, the world's first and largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s[542] and is often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. Companies such as McDonald's,[543] Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Domino's Pizza, among others, have numerous outlets around the world,[544]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in the United States\n\nSee also: Professional sports leagues in the United States, National Collegiate Athletic Association, and United States at the Olympics\n\n![](image)American football is the most popular sport in the United States; in this September 2022 National Football League game, the Jacksonville Jaguars play the Washington Commanders at FedExField.\nThe most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey, according to a 2017 *Gallup* poll.[545] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide.[546] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[547] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69 billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[548]\n\n\nAmerican football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[549] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[550] Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball being the top league. Basketball, soccer and ice hockey are the country's next three most popular professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League, which are the premier leagues worldwide for these sports. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[551][552]\n\n\nOn the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[553] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA Final Four is one of the most watched national sporting events.[554] In many respects, the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system to the professional level, as the elite college athletes are chosen to compete at the next level. This system differs greatly from nearly all other countries in the world, which generally have government-funded sports organizations that serve as a feeder system for professional competition.[555]\n\n\nEight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[556] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games, by far the most of any country.[557][558][559]\n\n\nIn international soccer, the men's national soccer team qualified for eleven World Cups, and the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[560] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[561]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lists of U.S. state topics\n* Outline of the United States\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 30 of 50 states recognize only English as an official language.

It is the world's third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations.[j] With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous country in the Americas and the third-most populous in the world. The national capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and principal financial center is New York City.\n\n\nIndigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years. Beginning in 1607, British colonization led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States. They clashed with the British Crown over taxation and political representation, which led to the American Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary War. The United States declared independence on July 4, 1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and liberal democracy. The country began expanding across North America, spanning the continent by 1848. Sectional division over slavery (primarily of Africans) led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861–1865). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. However, racial discrimination and inequality continued into subsequent centuries. By 1900, the United States had established itself as a great power, becoming the world's largest economy. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the side of the Allies. The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence but avoided direct military conflict. During the Space Race, the United States landed the first humans on the Moon, notably with the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower.\n\n\nThe United States government is a federal presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction which may not conflict with the Constitution.[26][27] The U.S. ranks very highly in international measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption. It has higher levels of incarceration and inequality than most other liberal democracies and is the only liberal democracy without universal healthcare. As a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the U.S. has been extensively shaped by the world's largest immigrant population.\n\n\nHighly developed, the U.S. has by far the largest amount of wealth of any country. The American economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP and is the world's largest by nominal GDP. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter, as well as the largest consumer market. It is a founding member of the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, NATO and WHO, and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is the world's foremost political, cultural, economic, military, and scientific power.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of the United States and Demonyms for the United States\n\nThe first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his desire to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[28][29][30] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in *The Virginia Gazette* newspaper in Williamsburg, on April 6, 1776.[31]\n\n\nBy June 1776, the name \"United States of America\" appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, authored by John Dickinson, a Founding Father from the Province of Pennsylvania,[32][33] and in the Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776.[32]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States\n\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of United States history.\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Native Americans in the United States and Pre-Columbian era\n\n![](image)Cliff Palace, located in present-day Colorado, was built by Ancestral Puebloans.\nThe first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia across the Bering land bridge at least 12,000 years ago; some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.[34][35][36] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000BC, is believed to represent the first widespread culture in the Americas.[37][38] The Clovis culture was replaced by several more localized regional societies from the Younger Dryas cold-climate period onward.[39]\n\n\nOver time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[40] The city-state of Cahokia was the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in present-day United States.[41] In the Four Corners region in present-day Southwestern United States, the culture of Ancestral Puebloans developed over centuries of agricultural experimentation.[42] The Algonquian were historically prominent along the Atlantic Coast and in the Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes regions. Before European immigrants made contact, most of the Algonquian relied on hunting and fishing, and many supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans, and squash, known as the \"Three Sisters\". By the time of European contact in the 17th century, they practiced slash and burn agriculture, using controlled fire to extend farmlands' productivity and manage land.[43][44][45][46][47][48] The Ojibwe cultivated wild rice.[49] The Iroquois confederation Haudenosaunee, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established between the 12th and 15th centuries.[50] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants[51][52] range from around 500,000[53][51] to nearly 10 million.[51][52]\n\n\n\n### Colonization (1492–1763)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colonial history of the United States\n\n![](image)British North America in 1775 with the 13 colonies shown in red\nChristopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean in 1492, and Spain soon established Spanish Florida on the mainland.[54][55] \nThe Spanish Empire set up their first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, including in Saint Augustine (1565), which is often considered the nation's oldest city,[56] and Santa Fe (1598). The Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, sent by France to the New World in 1525, encountered Native American inhabitants in the present-day New York Bay region.[57] The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico, including in New Orleans (1718) and Mobile (1702).[58]\nBritish colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and Plymouth Colony (1620).[59][60] Many English settlers were dissenting Christians who fled England seeking religious freedom.[61] The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[62][63]\n\n\nDuring 17th-century European colonization, settlers experienced food shortages, disease, and conflicts with Native Americans, particularly in King Philip's War, but often came to develop a mutual dependency. Settlers traded guns, tools, and European goods for food and animal pelts.[64] Native Americans taught settlers to cultivate local foods. Colonial authorities often pursued policies to to \"civilize\" the Native Americans and urge or force them to adopt European lifestyles.[65][66] The native population of America declined after European arrival,[67][68][69] primarily as a result of infectious diseases brought from Europe such as smallpox and measles,[70][71] and native peoples were displaced by European expansion.[72]\n\n\nEuropean settlers trafficked African slaves into the colonial United States via the transatlantic slave trade.[73] By the turn of the 18th century, slavery supplanted indentured servitude as the main source of agricultural labor for the cash crops in the Southern Colonies.[74] Southern tobacco colonies passed laws designed to keep African Americans subservient.[75][76][77]\n\n\nThe original Thirteen Colonies[l] were administered by Great Britain.[78] All colonies had local governments with elections open to white male property owners except Jews and, in some areas, Catholics.[79][80] With very high birth rates, low death rates, and steadily growing settlements, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations.[81] By the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[82] The colonies' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance, [83] and the First Great Awakening—a series of Christian revivals—fueled colonial interest in religious liberty.[84]\n\n\n\n### Revolution and the new nation (1763–1789)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1776–1789)\n\nFurther information: American Enlightenment\n\n![See caption](image)*Declaration of Independence*, a portrait by John Trumbull depicting the Committee of Five presenting the draft of the Declaration to the Continental Congress on June 28, 1776, in Philadelphia\nAfter the British victory in the French and Indian War, won largely through the support from the colonies, the British began to assert greater control in local colonial affairs, fomenting colonial political resistance. In 1774, to demonstrate colonial dissatisfaction with the lack of representation in the British government that extracted taxes from them, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia and passed the Continental Association, which mandated a colonies-wide boycott of British goods. The British attempted to disarm the Americans, resulting in the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and charged a committee led by Thomas Jefferson with writing a Declaration of Independence.[85]\n\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, which famously stated: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" The adoption of the Declaration of Independence is celebrated annually on July 4 in the United States as Independence Day.[86] After the surrender of a second British Army at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty gained international recognition, and the new nation took possession of substantial territory east of the Mississippi River, from what is present-day Canada in the north to Florida in the south.[87] Washington resigned his commission, returned to private life, and the Continental Army was disbanded. \n\n\n\n![](image)*The Old Plantation*, a c. 1790 painting of a plantation by a South Carolina slaveholder\nRatified by the states in 1781 and based on the concept of \"consent of the governed\", the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[86] Considered one of the most important legislative acts of the Confederation Congress,[88] the Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the national government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states.[89] The prohibition of slavery in the Northwest Territory had the practical effect of establishing the Ohio River as an extension of the Mason–Dixon line, the geographic and political divide between slave states and free states.[90][91]\n\n\nAs it became increasingly apparent that the Confederation was insufficient to govern the new country, nationalists advocated for and led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, where the United States Constitution was drafted. The U.S. Constitution is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force today.[92] Ratified by the states, it went into effect in 1789, reorganizing the government into a federation administered by three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative), on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. George Washington was elected the nation's first President under the new constitution and returned to public life. The Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay concerns by sceptics of the more centralized national government.[93][94]\n\n\n\n### Expansion (1789–1860)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1789–1849)\n ![](image)Animated map of the territorial evolution of the United States (click to view full size image)\nDuring the colonial period, slavery was legal in the American colonies. However, during the American Revolution, many began to question the practice.[95] Founding Fathers in the northern United States advocated for the abolition of slavery, and slavery was abolished in Northern states.[96] The increased profitability for southern elites after the cotton gin lowered production costs entrenched support for slavery in the southern United States.[97][98][99]\n\n\nIn the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, with a sense of manifest destiny.[100] The Louisiana Purchase (1803) nearly doubled the territory of the United States, and effectively ended French opposition to America's westward expansion.[101] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a virtual draw but established the United States as capable of defending itself.[102] Spain ceded Florida and their Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[103] The Missouri Compromise (1820) admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, dividing the country into free states, which forbade slavery, and slave states, which protected the institution.[104] [105]\n\n\nAs Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[106][107] The displacement prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River.[108][109] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[105] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[110] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, resulting in the U.S. stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans.[100][111]\n\n\n\n### Civil War and Reconstruction (1860–1876)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1849–1865) and 1865–1918\n\n![](image)Division of the states during the American Civil War\n * Union states\n* Border states\n* Confederate states\n* Territories\nSectional conflict regarding slavery[112] culminated in the American Civil War.[113] Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the remaining states (the Union) maintained that secession was unconstitutional and illegitimate.[114] On April 12, 1861, the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter, a federal garrison in Charleston, South Carolina. The ensuing Civil War (1861–1865) became the deadliest military conflict in American history.[115] In 1863, the Civil War began to turn in the Union's favor following the Siege of Vicksburg led by General Ulysses S. Grant, which gave them control of the Mississippi River, and the Battle of Gettysburg, where the Union Army halted Confederate Army general Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North. In April 1865, following the Union Army's victory at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, the Confederacy surrendered.[116]\n\n\n![](image)Sketch of Chinese railroad workers on the Central Pacific Railroad, 1870\nThe Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Radical Republicans passed the Reconstruction Amendments to ensure the rights of African Americans. The biracial Southern governments were opposed by terrorist and paramilitary organizations. To encourage additional westward settlement the Homestead Acts allowed an applicant to acquire ownership of government land, by residing there. More than 160 million acres (650 thousand km2; 250 thousand sq mi)—nearly 10 percent of the total area of the United States—were given away free to 1.6 million homesteaders. The Southern Homestead Act of 1866 was enacted to break a cycle of debt during Reconstruction. This act attempted to sell land at low prices so marginalized Southerners could buy it, but many were still too poor to afford the lower prices.[117] National infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred growth in the American Old West. New transcontinental railways made relocation easier, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[118]\n\n\n\n### Development of the modern United States (1876–1914)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1865–1918)\n\n![](image)An October 24th, 1874 Harper's Magazine editorial cartoon by Thomas Nast denouncing Ku Klux Klan and White League murders of African Americans\nThe Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[119][120] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[121] From 1890 to 1910, the Southern States established Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising almost all African Americans. Racial segregation was prevalent nationwide and discrimination was codified, especially in the South,[122] while well into the 20th century lynching and other forms of unjustified vigilante violence often went unprosecuted.[123][124]\n\n\nTerritorial expansion continued apace. Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[125] Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain following the Spanish–American War.[126] Puerto Ricans did not gain citizenship either through the Foraker Act (1900) or the Insular Cases (1901), but through the Jones–Shafroth Act in 1917,[127] allowing for the conscription of 20,000 Puerto Ricans, which began two months later.[128] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War.[129] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[130]\n\n\n\nAn Edison Studios film showing immigrants arriving at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, a major point of entry for European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries[131][132]\nFrom 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe including Great Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, Russia, and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.[133] Most came through the port of New York City, and from 1892 specifically through the now iconic Ellis Island. New York and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[134] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[135]\n\n\nRapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[136] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, and the United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[137] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, which prompted the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[138][139][140] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[141]\n\n\n\n### World Wars period (1914–1945)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1918–1945)\n\n![](image)The Trinity nuclear test in the Jornada del Muerto desert on July 16, 1945, part of the Manhattan Project and the first detonation of a nuclear weapon\nThe early 20th century was a time of industrial expansion and social change in the United States.[142][143] The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.[144] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage.[145] During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for mass communication and ultimately the invention of early television transformed communications in the United States.[146] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to with New Deal social and economic policies.[147][148]\n\n\nAt first neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.[149][150] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them again the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war.[151][152] The United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\" who met to plan the postwar world, alongside the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China.[153][154] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic and military influence.[155]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary United States (1945–present)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1945–1964), 1964–1980, 1980–1991, and 1991–2008\n\n![See caption](image)Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963.\nAfter World War II, the United States entered the Cold War, where geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union led the two countries to dominate the affairs of other countries.[156] The U.S. engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with the Soviet Union, and competed in the Space Race, culminating in the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.[157][158][159][160][161] Domestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following World War II.[162]\n\n\nThe civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s.[163] The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes towards what substances are acceptable for recreational drug use, sexuality[164][165] and the beginning of the modern gay rights movement as well as open defiance of the military draft and opposition to intervention in Vietnam.[166] The presidency of Richard Nixon saw the American withdrawal from Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, which led to a decline in public trust in government.[167]\n\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s saw economic stagflation and President Ronald Reagan responded with neoliberal reforms and a rollback strategy towards the Soviet Union.[168][169][170][171] By 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[172] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War and solidified the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.[173][174][175][176]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Twin Towers in New York City during the September 11 attacks, 2001\nIn the first decades of the 21st century, the U.S. faced challenges from terrorism, with the September 11 attacks in 2001 leading to the war on terror and military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.[177][178] The U.S. housing bubble in 2006 culminated in the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[179] Amid the financial crisis, Barack Obama, the first multiracial president, was elected in 2008.[180][181]\n\n\nPolitical polarization increased as sociopolitical debates on cultural issues dominated political discussion.[182] The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in over 100 million confirmed cases and 1 million deaths,[183] making it the most deadly pandemic in U.S. history.[184] Attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election culminated in the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol that attempted to prevent the peaceful transition of power.[185]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of the United States\n\n![](image)A topographic map of the United States\nThe United States is the world's third-largest nation by land and total area behind Russia and Canada.[c][186][187] The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km2).[188][189] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region.[190]\n\n\nThe Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[191] The Mississippi River System—the world's fourth longest river system—runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[191]\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[192] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts.[193] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[194] about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[195] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and continent.[196] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[197]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Köppen climate types of the United States\nMain articles: Climate of the United States and Climate change in the United States\n\nWith its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types. East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[198] The western Great Plains are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[199]\n\n\nStates bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley.[200] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country.[201] Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. In the American Southwest, droughts became more persistent and more severe.[202]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States\n\n![A bald eagle](image)The bald eagle, the national bird of the United States since 1782[203]\nThe U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[204] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, 295 amphibians,[205] and 91,000 insect species.[206]\n\n\nThere are 63 national parks, and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas, managed by the National Park Service and other agencies.[207] About 28% of the country's land is publicly owned and federally managed,[208] primarily in the western states.[209] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for industrial use, and less than one percent is used for military purposes.[210][211]\n\n\nEnvironmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, biological diversity, logging and deforestation,[212][213] and climate change.[214][215] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency charged with addressing most environmental-related issues.[216] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[217] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a way to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service implements and enforces the Act.[218] As of 2020, the U.S. ranked 24th among 180 nations in the Environmental Performance Index.[219] The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and has many other environmental commitments.[220]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Constitution of the United States, Politics of the United States, and Government of the United States\n\nFurther information: Political parties in the United States, Elections in the United States, Political ideologies in the United States, American patriotism, and American civil religion\n\n![](image)The Capitol and its two legislative chambers, the Senate (left) and the House of Representatives (right)\n![](image)The White House, the residence and workplace of the U.S. President and the offices of the presidential staff\n![](image)The Supreme Court Building, which houses the nation's highest court\nThe United States was founded on the principles of the American Enlightenment. It is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[221][222] It is the world's oldest surviving federation, and, according to the World Economic Forum, the oldest democracy as well.[223] It is a liberal representative democracy \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law.\"[224] The U.S. Constitution serves as the country's supreme legal document, establishing the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states.[225]\n\n\nThe federal government comprises three branches, which are headquartered in Washington, D.C. and regulated by a system of checks and balances.[226]\n\n\n\n* The U.S. Congress, a bicameral legislature, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[227] and has the power of impeachment.[228] The Senate has 100 members (2 from each state), elected for a six-year term. The House of Representatives has 435 members from single member congressional districts allocated to each state on the basis of population, elected for a two-year term.\n* The U.S. President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies through their respective agencies.[229] The president and the vice president are elected together in a presidential election.[230] It is an indirect election, with the winner being determined by votes cast by electors of the Electoral College. The President and Vice President serve a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice.\n* The U.S. federal judiciary, whose judges are all appointed for life by the President with Senate approval, consists primarily of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. District Courts. The U.S. Supreme Court interprets laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[231] The Supreme Court is led by the chief justice of the United States. It has nine members who serve for life. The members are appointed by the sitting president when a vacancy becomes available.[232]\n\n\n### Political subdivisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Political divisions of the United States, State government in the United States, Local government in the United States, and U.S. state\n\nFurther information: List of states and territories of the United States, Indian reservation, and Territories of the United States\n\nSee also: Territorial evolution of the United States\n\nIn the American federal system, sovereignty is shared between two levels of government: federal and state. Each of the 50 states has territory where it shares sovereignty with the federal government. People in the states are also represented by local elected governments, which are administrative divisions of the states. States are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington.[233] The territories and the District of Columbia are administrative divisions of the federal government.[234]\n\n![](image)\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States\n\n![see caption](image)The United Nations headquarters has been situated along the East River in Midtown Manhattan since 1952; in 1945, the United States was a founding member of the UN.\nThe United States has an established structure of foreign relations, and it had the world's second-largest diplomatic corps in 2019.[235] It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,[236] and home to the United Nations headquarters.[237] The United States is a member of the G7,[238] G20,[239] and OECD intergovernmental organizations.[240] Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran,[241] North Korea,[242] and Bhutan.[243] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations.[244] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[245]\n\n\nThe United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom[246] and strong ties with Canada,[247] Australia,[248] New Zealand,[249] the Philippines,[250] Japan,[251] South Korea,[252] Israel,[253] and several European Union countries (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland).[254] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with nations in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United States–Mexico–Canada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States.[255] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[256] It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with India,[257] and its ties with China have steadily deteriorated.[258][259] Since 2014, the U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine.[260][261]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Armed Forces and Military history of the United States\n\n![](image)The Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense\nThe President is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (2.8 million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), Korean (1.1 million), and German (1 million).[366]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to the United States\n\nAmerica's immigrant population, numbering more than 50 million, is by far the world's largest in absolute terms.[367][368] In 2022, there were 87.7 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for nearly 27% of the overall U.S. population.[369] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants.[370] In 2019, the top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico (24% of immigrants), India (6%), China (5%), the Philippines (4.5%), and El Salvador (3%).[371] The United States has led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[372]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligious affiliation in USA, per Gallup, Inc. (2022)[373]\n\n\n\nProtestantism (34%)\nCatholicism (23%)\nNon-specific Christian (11%)\nMormonism (2%)\nJudaism (2%)\nOther religions (6%)\nUnaffiliated (21%)\nNo answer (1%)\n\nMain articles: Religion in the United States and Irreligion in the United States\n\nSee also: List of religious movements that began in the United States\n\nThe First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment.[374][375] Religious practice is widespread, among the most diverse in the world,[376] and vibrant, with the country being far more religious than other wealthy Western nations.[377] An overwhelming majority of Americans believe in a higher power,[378] engage in spiritual practices such as prayer,[379] and consider themselves religious or spiritual.[380][381] The country has the world's largest Christian population.[382] A majority of the global Jewish population lives in the United States, as measured by the Law of Return.[383]\n\n\nA 2022 *Gallup* poll found that 31% reported \"attending a church, synagogue, mosque or temple weekly or nearly weekly\".[384] Religious practice varies significantly by region.[385] In the \"Bible Belt\", located within the Southern United States, evangelical Protestantism plays a significant role culturally. New England and the Western United States tend to be less religious,[385] although Mormonism—a Restorationist Christian movement started in New York in the 19th century—is the predominant religious affiliation in Utah.[386]\n\n\nAround 6% of Americans claim a non-Christian faith.[387] the largest of which are Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.[388] \"Ceremonial deism\" is common in American culture.[389] Religious belief and interest has remained relatively stable in recent years; organizational participation, in contrast, has decreased.[390] Other notable faiths include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, many New Age movements, and a large variety of Native American religions.[391]\n\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Urbanization in the United States and List of United States cities by population\n\nAbout 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[186] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[392] In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston) had populations exceeding two million.[393] Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[394]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in the United States2023 MSA population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau[395]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region | Pop. |  |\n| ![New York](image)New York![Los Angeles](image)Los Angeles | 1 | New York | Northeast | 19,498,249 | 11 | Boston | Northeast | 4,919,179\n | ![Chicago](image)Chicago![Dallas–Fort Worth](image)Dallas–Fort Worth |\n| 2 | Los Angeles | West | 12,799,100 | 12 | Riverside–San Bernardino | West | 4,688,053\n |\n| 3 | Chicago | Midwest | 9,262,825 | 13 | San Francisco | West | 4,566,961\n |\n| 4 | Dallas–Fort Worth | South | 8,100,037 | 14 | Detroit | Midwest | 4,342,304\n |\n| 5 | Houston | South | 7,510,253 | 15 | Seattle | West | 4,044,837\n |\n| 6 | Atlanta | South | 6,307,261 | 16 | Minneapolis–Saint Paul | Midwest | 3,712,020\n |\n| 7 | Washington, D.C. | South | 6,304,975 | 17 | Tampa–St. Petersburg | South | 3,342,963\n |\n| 8 | Philadelphia | Northeast | 6,246,160 | 18 | San Diego | West | 3,269,973\n |\n| 9 | Miami | South | 6,183,199 | 19 | Denver | West | 3,005,131\n |\n| 10 | Phoenix | West | 5,070,110 | 20 | Baltimore | South | 2,834,316\n |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Healthcare in the United States, Healthcare reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States\n\n![The Texas Medical Center, a cluster of contemporary skyscrapers, at night](image)Texas Medical Center in Houston is the largest medical complex in the world, employing 106,000 people and treating 10 million patients annually as of 2016.[396]\nIn a preliminary report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that U.S. life expectancy at birth was 76.4 years in 2021 (73.2 years for men and 79.1 years for women), down 0.9 years from 2020. The chief causes listed were the COVID-19 pandemic, accidents, drug overdoses, heart and liver disease, and suicides.[397][398] Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among Black and American Indian–Alaskan Native (AIAN) peoples.[399][400] Starting in 1998, the life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since.[401] The U.S. has one of the highest suicide rates among high-income countries.[402] Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight.[403] Poverty is the 4th leading risk factor for premature death in the United States annually, according to a 2023 study published in *JAMA*.[404][405]\n\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system far outspends that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer nations.[406] The United States is the only developed nation without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance.[407]\n\n\nGovernment-funded healthcare coverage for the poor (Medicaid) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA,[o][408] with the law roughly halving the uninsured share of the population according to the CDC.[409] Its legacy remains controversial.[410]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in the United States and Higher education in the United States\n\n![Photograph of the University of Virginia](image)The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of many public colleges and universities in the United States.\nAmerican public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or six (beginning with kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[411] Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[412] The basic literacy rate is near-universal.[186][413] The country has the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 403 (having won 406 awards).[414][415]\n\n\nThe United States has many private and public institutions of higher education including many of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25.[416][417][418] There are local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[419] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world,[420] spending an average of $12,794 per year on public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016–2017 school year.[421]\n\n\nAs for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[422] Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place,[423] student loan debt has increased by 102% in the last decade,[424] and exceeded 1.7 trillion dollars as of 2022.[425]\n\n\n\n## Culture and society[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of the United States and Society of the United States\n\n![The Statue of Liberty, a large teal bronze sculpture on a stone pedestal](image)The Statue of Liberty (*Liberty Enlightening the World*) on Liberty Island in New York Harbor was an 1866 gift from France that has become an iconic symbol of the American Dream.[426]\nAmericans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying political belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.[427][428] Culturally, the country has been described as having the values of individualism and personal autonomy,[429][430] having a strong work ethic,[431] competitiveness,[432] and voluntary altruism towards others.[433][434][435] According to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity, the highest in the world by a large margin.[436] Part of both the Anglosphere and Western World, the United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values,[437][438] and exerts major cultural influence on a global scale,[439][440] with the phenomenon being termed *Americanization*.[441] As such, the U.S. is considered a cultural superpower.[442]\n\n\nNearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Eurafrasia (\"the Old World\") within the past five centuries.[443] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[437][444] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture.[437] The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[445] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[446][447][448][449] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[450] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[451] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[452]\n\n\nThe United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country under the First Amendment,[453] which protects flag desecration, hate speech, blasphemy, and lese-majesty as forms of protected expression.[454][455][456] A 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured.[457] They are the \"most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the Internet without government censorship.\"[458] It is a socially progressive country[459] with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality.[460] LGBT rights in the United States are among the most advanced in the world.[460][461][462]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American literature and American philosophy\n\n![Photograph of Mark Twain](image)Mark Twain, who William Faulkner called \"the father of American literature\"[463]\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of their cues from Europe. Writers such as Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is recognized as an essential American poet.[464]\n\n\nAlmost until the 20th century pervasive anti-literacy laws prevented most people of color from learning to read or write.[465][466] In the 1920s, the New Negro Movement coalesced in Harlem, where many writers had migrated from the Southern United States and West Indies. Its pan-African perspective was a significant cultural export during the Jazz Age in Paris and as such was a key early influence on the *négritude* philosophy.[467]\n\n\nSince its first use in the 19th century, the term \"Great American Novel\" has been applied to many books, including Herman Melville's *Moby-Dick* (1851), Harriet Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* (1852), Twain's *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby* (1925), John Steinbeck's *The Grapes of Wrath* (1939), Harper Lee's *To Kill a Mockingbird* (1960), Toni Morrison's *Beloved* (1987), and David Foster Wallace's *Infinite Jest* (1996).[468][469][470]\n\n\nThirteen U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Louise Glück, Bob Dylan, and Toni Morrison.[471] Earlier laureates William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck have been recognized as influential 20th century writers.[472]\n\n\n\n### Mass media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mass media in the United States\n\nSee also: Newspapers in the United States, Television in the United States, Internet in the United States, Radio in the United States, and Video games in the United States\n\n![](image)Comcast Center in Philadelphia, headquarters of Comcast, the world's largest telecommunications and media conglomerate\nThe four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[473] As of 2021[update], about 83% of Americans over age 12 listen to broadcast radio, while about 41% listen to podcasts.[474] As of September 30, 2014[update], there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[475] Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.[476]\n\n\nGlobally-recognized newspapers in the United States include *The Wall Street Journal*, *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, and *USA Today*.[477] More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[478][479] With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as *The Village Voice* in New York City and *LA Weekly* in Los Angeles. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Amazon, Yahoo, and Facebook, with all of them being American companies.[480]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the video game market of the United States is the world's largest by revenue.[481] Major video game publishers and developers headquartered in the United States are Sony Interactive Entertainment, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda Softworks, Epic Games, Valve, Warner Bros., Riot Games, and others.[482][483] There are 444 publishers, developers, and hardware companies in California alone.[484]\n\n\n\n### Theater[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Theater in the United States\n\n![](image)Broadway theatres in Theater District, Manhattan, New York City\nThe United States is well known for its cinema and theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater.[485] In the 19th century, America had created new dramatic forms in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show.[486]\n\n\nThe central hub of the American theater scene is Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.[487] Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active community theater culture.[488]\n\n\nAlthough earlier styles of theater such as minstrel shows and Vaudeville acts have disappeared from the landscape,[489] theater still remains a popular contemporary American art form. Broadway productions still entertain millions of theatergoers even as productions have become more elaborate and expensive.[490] The Theater District is an internationally prominent tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, for the 2018–19 season total attendance was 14,768,254 and $1,829,312,140 in grosses.[491]\n\n\nThe Tony Awards recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre and are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League[492] at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.[493]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of the United States\n\n![](image)The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee\nAmerican folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, Mainland Europe, or Africa.[494]\n\n\nThe rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have significantly influenced American music at large. The Smithsonian Institution states, \"African-American influences are so fundamental to American music that there would be no American music without them.\"[495] One instrument first mass-produced in the United States was the banjo, which had originally been crafted from gourds covered by animal skins by African slaves.[496][497] Banjos became widely popular in the 19th century due to their use in minstrel shows.[496] Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century.[498]\n\n\nThe United States has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of $4.9 billion in 2014.[499] Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[500] Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the pioneers of rock and roll in the mid-1950s. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing musical acts in worldwide sales.[501][502][503] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters.[504] Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra,[505] and Elvis Presley became global celebrities,[498] as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Prince, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey,[506][507] and of the early 21th century, such as Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, and Lady Gaga.[508] The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States.[509] American professional opera singers have reached the highest level of success in that form, including Renée Fleming, Leontyne Price, Beverly Sills, Nelson Eddy, and many others.[510]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Visual art of the United States and Architecture of the United States\n\n![](image)*Nighthawks* (1942) by Edward Hopper is one of his best-known works, Art Institute of Chicago.\nIn the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[511] Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles, which would become known as American modernism. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.[512]\n\n\nThe uniquely American \"Chicago School\" refers to two architectural styles derived from the architecture of Chicago. In the history of architecture, the first Chicago School was a school of architects active in Chicago in the late 19th, and at the turn of the 20th century. They were among the first to promote the new technologies of steel-frame construction in commercial buildings, and developed a spatial aesthetic which co-evolved with, and then came to influence, parallel developments in European modernism. Much of its early work is known as \"Commercial Style\".[513] A \"Second Chicago School\" with a modernist aesthetic emerged in the 1940s through 1970s, which pioneered new building technologies and structural systems, such as the tube-frame structure.[514] The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[515]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of the United States\n\n![](image)The iconic Hollywood Sign, in the Hollywood Hills, often regarded as the symbol of the American film industry\nThe U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is the leader in motion picture production and the most recognizable movie industry in the world.[516][517][518] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[519][520] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[521] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[522] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[523]\n\n\nDirector D. W. Griffith's film adaptation of *The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan* was the first American blockbuster, earning the equivalent of $1.8 billion in current dollars. The technical achievements of the film revolutionized film grammar, while its subject matter caused both strident protest and a revitalization of the Klan.[524] Producer and entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[525] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[526] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[527][528] In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\"[529] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[530] The 21st century has been marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, and Apple TV+, which came to rival traditional cinema.[531][532]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American cuisine\n\nFurther information: List of American regional and fusion cuisines\n\n![](image)A bacon cheeseburger served with french fries, fried onions and ketchup\nEarly settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour,[533] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[534][535] New World crops, especially corn and potatoes, and the native turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when many Americans make or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[536]\n\n\nCharacteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[537][538][539][540] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[541]\n\n\nThe American fast food industry, the world's first and largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s[542] and is often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. Companies such as McDonald's,[543] Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Domino's Pizza, among others, have numerous outlets around the world,[544]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in the United States\n\nSee also: Professional sports leagues in the United States, National Collegiate Athletic Association, and United States at the Olympics\n\n![](image)American football is the most popular sport in the United States; in this September 2022 National Football League game, the Jacksonville Jaguars play the Washington Commanders at FedExField.\nThe most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey, according to a 2017 *Gallup* poll.[545] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide.[546] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[547] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69 billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[548]\n\n\nAmerican football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[549] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[550] Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball being the top league. Basketball, soccer and ice hockey are the country's next three most popular professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League, which are the premier leagues worldwide for these sports. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[551][552]\n\n\nOn the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[553] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA Final Four is one of the most watched national sporting events.[554] In many respects, the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system to the professional level, as the elite college athletes are chosen to compete at the next level. This system differs greatly from nearly all other countries in the world, which generally have government-funded sports organizations that serve as a feeder system for professional competition.[555]\n\n\nEight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[556] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games, by far the most of any country.[557][558][559]\n\n\nIn international soccer, the men's national soccer team qualified for eleven World Cups, and the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[560] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[561]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lists of U.S. state topics\n* Outline of the United States\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 30 of 50 states recognize only English as an official language.

It consists of over 17,000 islands, including Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, and parts of Borneo and New Guinea. Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic state and the 14th-largest country by area, at 1,904,569 square kilometres (735,358 square miles). With around 279 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth-most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority country. Java, the world's most populous island, is home to more than half of the country's population.\n\n\nIndonesia is a presidential republic with an elected legislature. It has 38 provinces, of which nine have special status. The country's capital, Jakarta, is the world's second-most populous urban area. Indonesia shares land borders with Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and the eastern part of Malaysia, as well as maritime borders with Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, Palau, and India. Despite its large population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity.\n\n\nThe Indonesian archipelago has been a valuable region for trade since at least the seventh century when the Srivijaya and later Majapahit Kingdoms traded with entities from mainland China and the Indian subcontinent. Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign influences from the early centuries, and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished. Muslim traders later brought Islam, and European powers fought one another to monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery. Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism, Indonesia secured its independence after World War II. Indonesia's history has since been turbulent, with challenges posed by natural disasters, corruption, separatism, a democratisation process, and periods of rapid economic change.\n\n\nIndonesia consists of thousands of distinct native ethnic and hundreds of linguistic groups, with Javanese being the largest. A shared identity has developed with the motto *\"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\"* (\"Unity in Diversity\" *literally*, \"many, yet one\"), defined by a national language, cultural diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. The economy of Indonesia is the world's 16th-largest by nominal GDP and the 7th-largest by PPP. It is the world's third-largest democracy, a regional power and is considered a middle power in global affairs. The country is a member of several multilateral organisations, including the United Nations, World Trade Organization, G20, and a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, East Asia Summit, D-8 and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of Indonesia\n\nThe name *Indonesia* derives from the Greek words *Indos* (Ἰνδός) and *nesos* (νῆσος), meaning \"Indian islands\".[12] The name dates back to the 19th century, far predating the formation of independent Indonesia.[13] In 1850, George Windsor Earl, an English ethnologist, proposed the terms *Indunesians*—and, his preference, *Malayunesians*—for the inhabitants of the \"Indian Archipelago or Malay Archipelago\".[14] In the same publication, one of his students, James Richardson Logan, used *Indonesia* as a synonym for *Indian Archipelago*.[15][16] Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use *Indonesia*. They preferred *Malay Archipelago* (Dutch: *Maleische Archipel*); the *Netherlands East Indies* (*Nederlandsch Oost Indië*), popularly *Indië*; *the East* (*de Oost*); and *Insulinde*.[17]\n\n\nAfter 1900, *Indonesia* became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands, and native nationalist groups adopted it for political expression.[17] Adolf Bastian of the University of Berlin popularized the name through his book *Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayischen Archipels, 1884–1894*. The first native scholar to use the name was Ki Hajar Dewantara when in 1913, he established a press bureau in the Netherlands, *Indonesisch Pers-bureau*.[13]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Indonesia\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Borobudur ship carved on Borobudur temple, c. 800 CE. Outrigger boats from the archipelago may have made trade voyages to the east coast of Africa and Madagascar as early as the 1st century CE.[18]\nFossilised remains of *Homo erectus*, popularly known as the \"Java Man\", suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago.[19][20][21] *Homo sapiens* reached the region around 43,000 BCE.[22] Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population, migrated to Southeast Asia from what is now Taiwan. They arrived in the archipelago around 2,000 BCE and confined the native Melanesians to the far eastern regions as they spread east.[23]\n\n\nIdeal agricultural conditions and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE[24] allowed villages, towns, and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE. The archipelago's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade, including with Indian kingdoms and Chinese dynasties, from several centuries BCE.[25] Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history.[26][27]\n\n\nFrom the seventh century CE, the Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished due to trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism.[28][29] Between the eighth and tenth centuries CE, the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java, leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra's Borobudur and Mataram's Prambanan. The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century, and under Gajah Mada, its influence stretched over much of present-day Indonesia. This period is often referred to as a \"Golden Age\" in Indonesian history.[30]\n\n\nThe earliest evidence of Islamized populations in the archipelago dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra.[31] Other parts of the archipelago gradually adopted Islam, and it was the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century. For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia, particularly in Java.[32]\n\n\n\n### Colonial era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dutch East Indies\n\n![](image)The submission of Prince Diponegoro to General De Kock at the end of the Java War in 1830\nThe first Europeans arrived in the archipelago in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by Francisco Serrão, sought to monopolise the sources of nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in the Maluku Islands.[33] Dutch and British traders followed. In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and became the dominant European power for almost 200 years. The VOC was dissolved in 1799 following bankruptcy, and the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalised colony.[34]\n\n\nFor most of the colonial period, Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous. Dutch forces were engaged continuously in quelling rebellions on and off Java. The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java, Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra, Pattimura in Maluku, and the bloody thirty-year Aceh War weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces.[35][36][37] Only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia's current boundaries.[37][38][39][40]\n\n\nThe Japanese invasion and occupation during World War II ended Dutch rule[41][42][43] and encouraged the independence movement.[44] Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta issued the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence. Then, Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta and Sutan Sjahrir, influential nationalist leaders, were appointed president, vice-president and prime minister respectively.[45][46][47][45]\n\n\nThe Netherlands attempted to re-establish their rule, beginning the Indonesian National Revolution which ended in December 1949 when the Dutch recognised Indonesian independence in the face of international pressure.[48][47] Despite extraordinary political, social, and sectarian divisions, Indonesians, on the whole, found unity in their fight for independence.[49][50]\n\n\n\n### Post-World War II[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSukarno (*left*) and Hatta (*right*), Indonesia's founding fathers and the first President and Vice President respectively\n\nAs president, Sukarno moved Indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism and maintained power by balancing the opposing forces of the military, political Islam, and the increasingly powerful Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI).[51] Tensions between the military and the PKI culminated in an attempted coup in 1965. The army, led by Major General Suharto, countered by instigating a violent anti-communist purge that killed between 500,000 and one million people and incarcerated roughly a million more in concentration camps.[52][53][54][55] The PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed.[56][57][58] Suharto capitalised on Sukarno's weakened position, and following a drawn-out power play with Sukarno, Suharto was appointed president in March 1968. His \"New Order\" administration,[59] supported by the United States,[60][61][62] encouraged foreign direct investment,[63][64][65] which was a crucial factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth.\n\n\nIndonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[66] It brought out popular discontent with the New Order's corruption and suppression of political opposition and ultimately ended Suharto's presidency.[41][67][68][69] In 1999, East Timor seceded from Indonesia, following its 1975 invasion by Indonesia[70] and a 25-year occupation marked by international condemnation of human rights abuses.[71]\n\n\nSince 1998, democratic processes have been strengthened by enhancing regional autonomy and instituting the country's first direct presidential election in 2004.[72] Political, economic and social instability, corruption, and instances of terrorism remained problems in the 2000s; however, the economy has performed strongly since 2007. Although relations among the diverse population are mostly harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problematic in some areas.[73] A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005.[74]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Indonesia and List of islands of Indonesia\n\n![](image)Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java. Indonesia's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world's highest.\nIndonesia lies between latitudes 11°S and 6°N and longitudes 95°E and 141°E. A transcontinental country spanning Southeast Asia and Oceania, it is the world's largest archipelagic state, extending 5,120 kilometres (3,181 mi) from east to west and 1,760 kilometres (1,094 mi) from north to south.[75] The country's Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investments Affairs says Indonesia has 17,504 islands (with 16,056 registered at the UN)[76] scattered over both sides of the equator, around 6,000 of which are inhabited.[77] The largest are Sumatra, Java, Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia), Sulawesi, and New Guinea (shared with Papua New Guinea).[78] Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on Borneo and Sebatik, Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea, East Timor on the island of Timor, and maritime borders with Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Palau, and Australia.\n\n\nAt 4,884 metres (16,024 ft), Puncak Jaya is Indonesia's highest peak, and Lake Toba in Sumatra is the largest lake, with an area of 1,145 km2 (442 sq mi). Indonesia's largest rivers are in Kalimantan and New Guinea and include Kapuas, Barito, Mamberamo, Sepik and Mahakam. They serve as communication and transport links between the island's river settlements.[79]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Climate of Indonesia and Climate change in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Rainforest in Mount Palung National Park, West Kalimantan\nIndonesia lies along the equator, and its climate tends to be relatively even year-round.[80] Indonesia has two seasons—a wet season and a dry season—with no extremes of summer or winter.[81] For most of Indonesia, the dry season falls between May and October, with the wet season between November and April.[81] Indonesia's climate is almost entirely tropical, dominated by the tropical rainforest climate found on every large island of Indonesia. More cooling climate types do exist in mountainous regions that are 1,300 to 1,500 metres (4,300 to 4,900 feet) above sea level. The oceanic climate (Köppen *Cfb*) prevails in highland areas adjacent to rainforest climates, with reasonably uniform precipitation year-round. In highland areas near the tropical monsoon and tropical savanna climates, the subtropical highland climate (Köppen *Cwb*) is prevalent with a more pronounced dry season.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Köppen-Geiger climate classification map of Indonesia[82]\nSome regions, such as Kalimantan and Sumatra, experience only slight differences in rainfall and temperature between the seasons, whereas others, such as Nusa Tenggara, experience far more pronounced differences with droughts in the dry season and floods in the wet. Rainfall varies across regions, with more in western Sumatra, Java, and the interiors of Kalimantan and Papua, and less in areas closer to Australia, such as Nusa Tenggara, which tends to be dry. The almost uniformly warm waters that constitute 81% of Indonesia's area ensure that land temperatures remain relatively constant. Humidity is quite high, at between 70 and 90%. Winds are moderate and generally predictable, with monsoons usually blowing in from the south and east in June through October and from the northwest in November through March. Typhoons and large-scale storms pose little hazard to mariners; significant dangers come from swift currents in channels, such as the Lombok and Sape straits.[83]\n\n\nSeveral studies consider Indonesia to be at severe risk from the projected effects of climate change.[84] These include unreduced emissions resulting in an average temperature rise of around 1 °C (2 °F) by mid-century,[85][86] raising the frequency of drought and food shortages (with an impact on precipitation and the patterns of wet and dry seasons, and thus Indonesia's agriculture system[86]) as well as numerous diseases and wildfires.[86] Rising sea levels would also threaten most of Indonesia's population, who live in low-lying coastal areas.[86][87][88] Impoverished communities would likely be affected the most by climate change.[89]\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of Indonesia\n See also: Volcanoes of Indonesia\n\n![](image)Major volcanoes in Indonesia. Indonesia is in the Pacific Ring of Fire area.\nTectonically, most of Indonesia's area is highly unstable, making it a site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes.[90] It lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the Indo-Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate are pushed under the Eurasian plate, where they melt at about 100 kilometres (62 miles) deep. A string of volcanoes runs through Sumatra, Java, Bali and Nusa Tenggara, and then to the Banda Islands of Maluku to northeastern Sulawesi.[91] Of the 400 volcanoes, around 130 are active.[90] Between 1972 and 1991, there were 29 volcanic eruptions, mostly on Java.[92] Volcanic ash has made agricultural conditions unpredictable in some areas.[93] However, it has also resulted in fertile soils, a factor in historically sustaining the high population densities of Java and Bali.[94]\n\n\nA massive supervolcano erupted at present-day Lake Toba around 70,000 BCE. It is believed to have caused a global volcanic winter and cooling of the climate and subsequently led to a genetic bottleneck in human evolution, though this is still in debate.[95] The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora and the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa were among the largest in recorded history. The former caused 92,000 deaths and created an umbrella of volcanic ash that spread and blanketed parts of the archipelago and made much of the Northern Hemisphere without summer in 1816.[96] The latter produced the loudest sound in recorded history and caused 36,000 deaths due to the eruption itself and the resulting tsunamis, with significant additional effects around the world years after the event.[97] Recent catastrophic disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Fauna of Indonesia, Flora of Indonesia, and Protected areas of Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSpecies endemic to Indonesia. **Clockwise from top**: *Rafflesia arnoldii*; orangutan; greater bird-of-paradise; and Komodo dragon.\n\nIndonesia's size, tropical climate, and archipelagic geography support one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity, and it is among the 17 megadiverse countries identified by Conservation International. Its flora and fauna are a mixture of Asian and Australasian species.[98][99] The Sunda Shelf islands (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Bali) were once linked to mainland Asia and have a wealth of Asian fauna. Large species such as the Sumatran tiger, rhinoceros, orangutan, Asian elephant, and leopard were once abundant as far east as Bali, but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically. Having been long separated from the continental landmasses, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku have developed their unique flora and fauna.[100][101] Papua was part of the Australian landmass and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia, including over 600 bird species.[102]\n\n\nIndonesia is second only to Australia in terms of total endemic species, with 36% of its 1,531 species of bird and 39% of its 515 species of mammal being endemic.[103] Tropical seas surround Indonesia's 80,000 kilometres (50,000 miles) of coastline. The country has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems, including beaches, dunes, estuaries, mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, coastal mudflats, tidal flats, algal beds, and small island ecosystems.[12] Indonesia is one of the Coral Triangle countries with the world's most enormous diversity of coral reef fish, with more than 1,650 species in eastern Indonesia only.[104]\n\n\nBritish naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace described a dividing line (Wallace Line) between the distribution of Indonesia's Asian and Australasian species.[105] It runs roughly north–south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf, between Kalimantan and Sulawesi, and along the deep Lombok Strait, between Lombok and Bali. Flora and fauna on the west of the line are generally Asian, while east from Lombok is increasingly Australian until the tipping point at the Weber Line. In his 1869 book, *The Malay Archipelago*, Wallace described numerous species unique to the area.[106] The region of islands between his line and New Guinea is now termed Wallacea.[105]\n\n\n\n![](image)Deforestation in Riau province, Sumatra, to make way for an oil palm plantation (2007)\nIndonesia's large and growing population and rapid industrialisation present serious environmental issues. They are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance.[107] Problems include the destruction of peatlands, large-scale illegal deforestation (causing extensive haze across parts of Southeast Asia), over-exploitation of marine resources, air pollution, garbage management, and reliable water and wastewater services.[107] These issues contribute to Indonesia's low ranking (number 116 out of 180 countries) in the 2020 Environmental Performance Index. The report also indicates that Indonesia's performance is generally below average in both regional and global context.[108]\n\n\nIndonesia has one of the world's fastest deforestation rates.[109][110] In 2020, forests covered approximately 49.1% of the country's land area,[111] down from 87% in 1950.[112] Since the 1970s, log production, various plantations and agriculture have been responsible for much of the deforestation in Indonesia.[112] Most recently, it has been driven by the palm oil industry,[113] which has been criticised for its environmental impact and displacement of local communities.[110][114] The situation has made Indonesia the world's largest forest-based emitter of greenhouse gases.[115] It also threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) identified 140 species of mammals as threatened and 15 as critically endangered, including the Bali myna,[116] Sumatran orangutan,[117] and Javan rhinoceros.[118] Some academics describe the deforestation and other environmental destruction in the country as an ecocide.[119][120][121]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Indonesia\n\n![](image)A presidential inauguration by the MPR in the Parliament Complex Jakarta, 2014\nIndonesia is a republic with a presidential system. Following the fall of the New Order in 1998, political and governmental structures have undergone sweeping reforms, with four constitutional amendments revamping the executive, legislative and judicial branches.[122] Chief among them is the delegation of power and authority to various regional entities while remaining a unitary state.[123] The President of Indonesia is the head of state and head of government, commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (*Tentara Nasional Indonesia*, TNI), and the director of domestic governance, policy-making, and foreign affairs. The president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms.[124]\n\n\nThe highest representative body at the national level is the People's Consultative Assembly (*Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat*, MPR). Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution, inaugurating and impeaching the president,[125][126] and formalising broad outlines of state policy. The MPR comprises two houses; the People's Representative Council (*Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat*, DPR), with 575 members, and the Regional Representative Council (*Dewan Perwakilan Daerah*, DPD), with 136.[127] The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch. Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased its role in national governance,[122] while the DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management.[128][126]\n\n\nMost civil disputes appear before the State Court (*Pengadilan Negeri*); appeals are heard before the High Court (*Pengadilan Tinggi*). The Supreme Court of Indonesia (*Mahkamah Agung*) is the highest level of the judicial branch and hears final cessation appeals and conducts case reviews. Other courts include the Constitutional Court (*Mahkamah Konstitusi*) which listens to constitutional and political matters, and the Religious Court (*Pengadilan Agama*), which deals with codified Islamic Personal Law (*sharia*) cases.[129] Additionally, the Judicial Commission (*Komisi Yudisial*) monitors the performance of judges.[130]\n\n\n\n### Parties and elections[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of political parties in Indonesia and Elections in Indonesia\n\n![](image)\nJoko Widodo,  \n 7th President of Indonesia\n![](image)\nMa'ruf Amin,  \n 13th Vice President of Indonesia\n\nSince 1999, Indonesia has had a multi-party system. In all legislative elections since the fall of the New Order, no political party has won an overall majority of seats. The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), which secured the most votes in the 2019 elections, is the party of the incumbent president, Joko Widodo.[131] Other notable parties include the Party of the Functional Groups (*Golkar*), the Great Indonesia Movement Party (*Gerindra*), the Democratic Party, and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS).\n\n\nThe first general election was held in 1955 to elect members of the DPR and the Constitutional Assembly (*Konstituante*). The most recent elections in 2019 resulted in nine political parties in the DPR, with a parliamentary threshold of 4% of the national vote.[132] At the national level, Indonesians did not elect a president until 2004. Since then, the president is elected for a five-year term, as are the party-aligned members of the DPR and the non-partisan DPD.[127][122] Beginning with the 2015 local elections, elections for governors and mayors have occurred on the same date. In 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that legislative and presidential elections would be held simultaneously, starting in 2019.[133]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Subdivisions of Indonesia\n\nIndonesia has several levels of subdivisions. The first level are the provinces, which have a legislature (*Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah*, DPRD) and an elected governor. A total of 38 provinces have been established from the original eight in 1945,[134] with the most recent change being the split of Southwest Papua from the province of West Papua in 2022.[135] The second level are the regencies (*kabupaten*) and cities (*kota*), led by regents (*bupati*) and mayors (*walikota*) respectively and a legislature (*DPRD Kabupaten/Kota*). The third level are the districts (*kecamatan*, *distrik* in Papua, or *kapanewon* and *kemantren* in Yogyakarta), and the fourth are the villages (either *desa*, *kelurahan*, *kampung*, *nagari* in West Sumatra, or *gampong* in Aceh).[136]\n\n\nThe village is the lowest level of government administration. It is divided into several community groups (*rukun warga*, RW), which are further divided into neighbourhood groups (*rukun tetangga*, RT). In Java, the village (*desa*) is divided into smaller units called *dusun* or *dukuh* (hamlets), which are the same as RW. Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001, regencies and cities have become chief administrative units responsible for providing most government services. The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen's daily life and handles village or neighbourhood matters through an elected village head (*lurah* or *kepala desa*).[137]\n\n\nNine provinces—Aceh, Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, Southwest Papua and West Papua—are granted a special autonomous status (*otonomi khusus*) from the central government. A conservative Islamic territory, Aceh has the right to create some aspects of an independent legal system implementing *sharia*.[138] Jakarta is the only city with a provincial government due to its position as the capital of Indonesia.[139][140] Yogyakarta is the only pre-colonial monarchy legally recognised within Indonesia, with the positions of governor and vice governor being prioritised for the reigning Sultan of Yogyakarta and Duke of Pakualaman, respectively.[141] The six Papuan provinces are the only ones where the indigenous people have privileges in their local government.[142]\n\n\n\nThis section is transcluded from Template:Indonesia provinces labelled map.

Numerous attempts by the United States and the Soviet Union,[146][147] and China to some degree,[148] culminated in the 1965 coup attempt and subsequent upheaval that led to a reorientation of foreign policy.[149] Quiet alignment with the Western world while maintaining a non-aligned stance has characterised Indonesia's foreign policy since then.[150] Today, it maintains close relations with its neighbours and is a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the East Asia Summit. In common with most of the Muslim world, Indonesia does not have diplomatic relations with Israel and has actively supported Palestine. However, observers have pointed out that Indonesia has ties with Israel, albeit discreetly.[151]\n\n\nIndonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950[c] and was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).[153] Indonesia is a signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement, the Cairns Group, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and a former member of OPEC.[154] Indonesia has been a humanitarian and development aid recipient since 1967,[155][156] and recently, the country established its first overseas aid programme in late 2019.[157]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indonesian National Armed Forces and Military history of Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nIndonesian Armed Forces. **Clockwise from top**: Indonesian Army during training session; Sukhoi Su-30; Pindad Anoa; and Indonesian naval vessel Error: {{Ship}} invalid control parameter: 4 (help).\n\nIndonesia's Armed Forces (TNI) include the Army (TNI–AD), Navy (TNI–AL, which includes Marine Corps), and Air Force (TNI–AU). The army has about 400,000 active-duty personnel. Defence spending in the national budget was 0.7% of GDP in 2018,[158] with controversial involvement of military-owned commercial interests and foundations.[159] The Armed Forces were formed during the Indonesian National Revolution when it undertook guerrilla warfare along with informal militia. Since then, territorial lines have formed the basis of all TNI branches' structure, aimed at maintaining domestic stability and deterring foreign threats.[160] The military has possessed a strong political influence since its founding, which peaked during the New Order. Political reforms in 1998 included the removal of the TNI's formal representation from the legislature. Nevertheless, its political influence remains, albeit at a reduced level.[161]\n\n\nSince independence, the country has struggled to maintain unity against local insurgencies and separatist movements.[162] Some, notably in Aceh and Papua, have led to an armed conflict and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides.[163][164][165] The former was resolved peacefully in 2005,[74] while the latter has continued amid a significant, albeit imperfect, implementation of regional autonomy laws and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses as of 2006.[166] Other engagements of the army include the conflict against the Netherlands over the Dutch New Guinea, the opposition to the British-sponsored creation of Malaysia (\"Konfrontasi\"), the mass killings of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), and the invasion of East Timor, which remains Indonesia's most massive military operation.[167][168]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Indonesia and Economic history of Indonesia\n\nSee also: Agriculture in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Vast palm oil plantation in Bogor Regency, West Java. Indonesia is the world's largest producer of palm oil.[169]\nIndonesia has a mixed economy in which the private sector and government play vital roles.[170] As the only G20 member state in Southeast Asia,[171] the country has the largest economy in the region and is classified as a newly industrialised country. Per a 2023 estimate, it is the world's 16th largest economy by nominal GDP and 7th in terms of GDP at PPP, estimated to be US$1.417 trillion and US$4.393 trillion, respectively. Per capita GDP in PPP is US$15,835, while nominal per capita GDP is US$5,108.[7] Services are the economy's largest sector and account for 43.4% of GDP (2018), followed by industry (39.7%) and agriculture (12.8%).[172] Since 2009, it has employed more people than other sectors, accounting for 47.7% of the total labour force, followed by agriculture (30.2%) and industry (21.9%).[173]\n\n\nOver time, the structure of the economy has changed considerably.[174] Historically, it has been weighted heavily towards agriculture, reflecting both its stage of economic development and government policies in the 1950s and 1960s to promote agricultural self-sufficiency.[174] A gradual process of industrialisation and urbanisation began in the late 1960s and accelerated in the 1980s as falling oil prices saw the government focus on diversifying away from oil exports and towards manufactured exports.[174] This development continued throughout the 1980s and into the next decade despite the 1990 oil price shock, during which the GDP rose at an average rate of 7.1%. As a result, the official poverty rate fell from 60% to 15%.[175] Trade barriers reduction from the mid-1980s made the economy more globally integrated. The growth ended with the 1997 Asian financial crisis that severely impacted the economy, including a 13.1% real GDP contraction in 1998 and a 78% inflation. The economy reached its low point in mid-1999 with only 0.8% real GDP growth.[176]\n\n\nRelatively steady inflation[177] and an increase in GDP deflator and the Consumer Price Index[178] have contributed to strong economic growth in recent years. From 2007 to 2019, annual growth accelerated to between 4% and 6% due to improvements in the banking sector and domestic consumption,[179] helping Indonesia weather the 2008–2009 Great Recession,[180] and regain in 2011 the investment grade rating it had lost in 1997.[181] As of 2019[update], 9.41% of the population lived below the poverty line, and the official open unemployment rate was 5.28%.[182] During the first year of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the economy suffered its first recession since the 1997 crisis but recovered in the following year.[183]\n\n\nIndonesia has abundant natural resources. Its primary industries are fishing, petroleum, timber, paper products, cotton cloth, tourism, petroleum mining, natural gas, bauxite, coal and tin. Its main agricultural products are rice, coconuts, soybeans, bananas, coffee, tea, palm, rubber, and sugar cane.[184] These commodities make up a large portion of the country's exports, with palm oil and coal briquettes as the leading export commodities. In addition to refined and crude petroleum as the primary imports, telephones, vehicle parts and wheat cover the majority of additional imports. China, the United States, Japan, Singapore, India, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand are Indonesia's principal export markets and import partners.[185]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nTransport modes in Indonesia. **Clockwise from top**: TransJakarta bus; Whoosh high-speed train; Garuda Indonesia airliner; and Pelni ship.\n\nIndonesia's transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipelago and the distribution of its 275 million people highly concentrated on Java.[186] All transport modes play a role in the country's transport system and are generally complementary rather than competitive. In 2016, the transport sector generated about 5.2% of GDP.[187]\n\n\nThe road transport system is predominant, with a total length of 542,310 kilometres (336,980 miles) as of 2018[update].[188] Jakarta has the most extended bus rapid transit system globally, boasting 251.2 kilometres (156.1 miles) in 13 corridors and ten cross-corridor routes.[189] Rickshaws such as *bajaj* and *becak* and share taxis such as *Angkot* and *Minibus* are a regular sight in the country.\n\n\nMost railways are in Java, and partly Sumatra and Sulawesi,[190] used for freight and passenger transport, such as local commuter rail services (mainly in Greater Jakarta and Yogyakarta–Solo) complementing the inter-city rail network in several cities. In the late 2010s, Jakarta and Palembang were the first cities in Indonesia to have rapid transit systems, with more planned for other cities in the future.[191] In 2023, a high-speed rail connecting the cities of Jakarta and Bandung commenced operations, a first for Southeast Asia and the Southern Hemisphere.[192]\n\n\nIndonesia's largest airport, Soekarno–Hatta International Airport, is among the busiest in the Southern Hemisphere, serving 54 million passengers in 2019. Ngurah Rai International Airport and Juanda International Airport are the country's second-and third-busiest airport, respectively. Garuda Indonesia, the country's flag carrier since 1949, is one of the world's leading airlines and a member of the global airline alliance SkyTeam. The Port of Tanjung Priok is the busiest and most advanced Indonesian port,[193] handling more than 50% of Indonesia's trans-shipment cargo traffic.\n\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Sidrap wind farm, Indonesia's first wind power plant, in Sidrap Regency, South Sulawesi\nIn 2019, Indonesia produced 4,999 terawatt-hours (17.059 quadrillion British thermal units) and consumed 2,357 terawatt-hours (8.043 quadrillion British thermal units) worth of energy.[194] The country has substantial energy resources, including 22 billion barrels (3.5 billion cubic metres) of conventional oil and gas reserves (of which about 4 billion barrels are recoverable), 8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent of coal-based methane (CBM) resources, and 28 billion tonnes of recoverable coal.[195]\n\n\nIn late 2020, Indonesia's total national installed power generation capacity stands at 72,750.72 MW.[196] Although reliance on domestic coal and imported oil has increased between 2010 and 2019,[194][197] Indonesia has seen progress in renewable energy, with hydropower and geothermal being the most abundant sources that account for more than 8% in the country's energy mix.[194] A prime example of the former is the country's largest dam, Jatiluhur, which has an installed capacity of 186.5 MW that feeds into the Java grid managed by the State Electricity Company (*Perusahaan Listrik Negara*, PLN). Furthermore, Indonesia has the potential for solar, wind, biomass and ocean energy,[198] although as of 2021, power generation from these sources remain small.\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Palapa satellite launch in 1984\nGovernment expenditure on research and development is relatively low (0.3% of GDP in 2019),[199] and Indonesia only ranked 61st on the 2023 Global Innovation Index report up from 87th in 2021.[200][201] Historical examples of scientific and technological developments include the paddy cultivation technique *terasering*, which is common in Southeast Asia, and the pinisi boats by the Bugis and Makassar people.[202] In the 1980s, Indonesian engineer Tjokorda Raka Sukawati invented a road construction technique named Sosrobahu that later became widely used in several countries.[203] The country is also an active producer of passenger trains and freight wagons with its state-owned company, the Indonesian Railway Industry (INKA), and has exported trains abroad.[204]\n\n\nIndonesia has a long history of developing military and small commuter aircraft. It is the only country in Southeast Asia to build and produce aircraft. The state-owned Indonesian Aerospace company (*PT. Dirgantara Indonesia*) has provided components for Boeing and Airbus.[205] The company also collaborated with EADS CASA of Spain to develop the CN-235, which has been used by several countries.[206] Former President B. J. Habibie played a vital role in this achievement.[207] Indonesia has also joined the South Korean programme to manufacture the 4.5-generation fighter jet KAI KF-21 Boramae.[208]\n\n\nIndonesia has a space programme and space agency, the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (*Lembaga Penerbangan dan Antariksa Nasional*, LAPAN). In the 1970s, Indonesia became the first developing country to operate a satellite system called Palapa,[209] a series of communication satellites owned by Indosat. The first satellite, PALAPA A1, was launched on 8 July 1976 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, United States.[210] As of 2019[update], Indonesia has launched 18 satellites for various purposes.[211]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Indonesia\n![](image)Borobudur in Central Java, the world's largest Buddhist temple, is the single most visited tourist attraction in Indonesia.[212]\nTourism contributed around US$9.8 billion to GDP in 2020, and in the previous year, Indonesia received 15.4 million visitors.[213] Overall, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and Japan are the top five sources of visitors to Indonesia.[214] Since 2011, *Wonderful Indonesia* has been the country's international marketing campaign slogan to promote tourism.[215]\n\n\n\n![](image)Raja Ampat Islands, West Papua, has the highest recorded level of diversity in marine life, according to Conservation International.[216]\nNature and culture are prime attractions of Indonesian tourism. The country has a well-preserved natural ecosystem with rainforests stretching over about 57% of Indonesia's land (225 million acres). Forests on Sumatra and Kalimantan are examples of popular destinations, such as the Orangutan wildlife reserve. Moreover, Indonesia has one of the world's longest coastlines, measuring 54,716 kilometres (33,999 mi). The ancient Borobudur and Prambanan temples, as well as Toraja and Bali with their traditional festivities, are some of the popular destinations for cultural tourism.[217]\n\n\nIndonesia has nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Komodo National Park and the Sawahlunto Coal Mine; and a further 19 in a tentative list that includes Bunaken National Park and Raja Ampat Islands.[218] Other attractions include specific points in Indonesian history, such as the colonial heritage of the Dutch East Indies in the old towns of Jakarta and Semarang and the royal palaces of Pagaruyung, Ubud, and Yogyakarta.[217]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Indonesia and Indonesians\n\nSee also: List of Indonesian cities by population and List of metropolitan areas in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Indonesia's ten metropolitan areas labeled with their populations\nThe 2020 census recorded Indonesia's population as 270.2 million, the fourth largest in the world, with a moderately high population growth rate of 1.25%.[219] Java is the world's most populous island,[220] where 56% of the country's population lives.[6] The population density is 141 people per km2 (365 per sq mi),[6] ranking 88th in the world, although Java has a population density of 1,067 people per km2 (2,435 per sq mi). In 1961, the first post-colonial census recorded a total of 97 million people.[221] It is expected to grow to around 295 million by 2030 and 321 million by 2050.[222] The country currently possesses a relatively young population, with a median age of 30.2 years (2017 estimate).[77]\n\n\nThe spread of the population is uneven throughout the archipelago, with a varying habitats and levels of development, ranging from the megacity of Jakarta to uncontacted tribes in Papua.[223] As of 2017, about 54.7% of the population lives in urban areas.[224] Jakarta is the country's primate city and the second-most populous urban area globally, with over 34 million residents.[225] About 8 million Indonesians live overseas; most settled in Malaysia, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, South Africa, Singapore, Hong Kong, the United States, and Australia.[226]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities in Indonesia2023 BPS estimate\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Jakarta](image)Jakarta![Surabaya](image)Surabaya | 1 | Jakarta | Special Capital Region of Jakarta | 11,350,328 | 11 | South Tangerang | Banten | 1,404,785\n | ![Bekasi](image)Bekasi![Bandung](image)Bandung |\n| 2 | Surabaya | East Java | 3,009,286 | 12 | Batam | Riau Islands | 1,269,820\n |\n| 3 | Bekasi | West Java | 2,627,207 | 13 | Bandar Lampung | Lampung | 1,209,937\n |\n| 4 | Bandung | West Java | 2,506,603 | 14 | Bogor | West Java | 1,127,408\n |\n| 5 | Medan | North Sumatra | 2,494,512 | 15 | Pekanbaru | Riau | 1,007,540\n |\n| 6 | Depok | West Java | 2,145,400 | 16 | Padang | West Sumatra | 919,145\n |\n| 7 | Tangerang | Banten | 1,912,679 | 17 | Malang | East Java | 847,182\n |\n| 8 | Palembang | South Sumatra | 1,729,546 | 18 | Samarinda | East Kalimantan | 834,824\n |\n| 9 | Semarang | Central Java | 1,694,740 | 19 | Tasikmalaya | West Java | 741,760\n |\n| 10 | Makassar | South Sulawesi | 1,474,393 | 20 | Denpasar | Bali | 726,808\n |\n\n### Ethnic groups and languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ethnic groups in Indonesia, Native Indonesians, and Languages of Indonesia\n\n![](image)A map of ethnic groups in Indonesia\nIndonesia is an ethnically diverse country, with around 1,300 distinct native ethnic groups.[2] Most Indonesians are descended from Austronesian peoples whose languages had origins in Proto-Austronesian, which possibly originated in what is now Taiwan. Another major grouping is the Melanesians, who inhabit eastern Indonesia (the Maluku Islands, Western New Guinea and the eastern part of the Lesser Sunda Islands).[23][227][228][229]\n\n\nThe Javanese are the largest ethnic group, constituting 40.2% of the population,[2] and are politically dominant.[230] They are predominantly located in the central to eastern parts of Java and also in sizeable numbers in most provinces. The Sundanese are the next largest group (15.4%), followed by Batak, Madurese, Betawi, Minangkabau, Bugis and Malay people.[d] A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strong regional identities.[231]\n\n\nThe country's official language is Indonesian, a variant of Malay based on its prestige dialect, which had been the archipelago's *lingua franca* for centuries. It was promoted by nationalists in the 1920s and achieved official status in 1945 under the name *Bahasa Indonesia*.[232] Due to centuries-long contact with other languages, it is rich in local and foreign influences.[e] Nearly every Indonesian speaks the language due to its widespread use in education, academics, communications, business, politics, and mass media. Most Indonesians also speak at least one of more than 700 local languages,[1] often as their first language. Most belong to the Austronesian language family, while over 270 Papuan languages are spoken in eastern Indonesia.[1] Of these, Javanese is the most widely spoken[77] and has co-official status in the Special Region of Yogyakarta.[236]\n\n\nIn 1930, Dutch and other Europeans (*Totok*), Eurasians, and derivative people like the Indos, numbered 240,000 or 0.4% of the total population.[237] Historically, they constituted only a tiny fraction of the native population and remain so today. Also, the Dutch language never had a substantial number of speakers or official status despite the Dutch presence for almost 350 years.[238] The small minorities that can speak it or Dutch-based creole languages fluently are the aforementioned ethnic groups and descendants of Dutch colonisers. This reflected the Dutch colonial empire's primary purpose, which was commercial exchange as opposed to sovereignty over homogeneous landmasses.[239] Today, there is some degree of fluency by either educated members of the oldest generation or legal professionals,[240] as specific law codes are still only available in Dutch.[241]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Indonesia\n\nDespite guaranteeing religious freedom in the constitution,[242][126] the government officially recognises only six religions: Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism,[243][244] with indigenous religions only partly acknowledged.[244] With 231 million adherents (86.7%) in 2018, Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority country,[245][246] with Sunnis being the majority (99%).[247] The Shias and Ahmadis, respectively, constitute 1% (1–3 million) and 0.2% (200,000–400,000) of Muslims.[244][248] About 10% of Indonesians are Christians, who form the majority in several provinces in eastern Indonesia.[249] Most Hindus are Balinese,[250] and most Buddhists are Chinese Indonesians.[251]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Hindu prayer ceremony at Besakih Temple in Bali, the only Indonesian province where Hinduism is the predominant religion\nThe natives of the Indonesian archipelago originally practised indigenous animism and dynamism, beliefs that are common to Austronesian peoples.[252] They worshipped and revered ancestral spirits and believed that supernatural spirits (*hyang*) might inhabit certain places such as large trees, stones, forests, mountains, or sacred sites.[252] Examples of Indonesian native belief systems include the Sundanese Sunda Wiwitan, Dayak's Kaharingan, and the Javanese Kejawèn. They have significantly impacted how other faiths are practised, evidenced by a large proportion of people—such as the Javanese abangan, Balinese Hindus, and Dayak Christians—practising a less orthodox, syncretic form of their religion.[253]\n\n\nHindu influences reached the archipelago as early as the first century CE.[254] The Sundanese Kingdom of Salakanagara in western Java around 130 was the first historically recorded Indianised kingdom in the archipelago.[255] Buddhism arrived around the 6th century,[256] and its history in Indonesia is closely related to that of Hinduism, as some empires based on Buddhism had their roots around the same period. The archipelago has witnessed the rise and fall of powerful and influential Hindu and Buddhist empires such as Majapahit, Sailendra, Srivijaya, and Mataram. Though no longer a majority, Hinduism and Buddhism remain to have a substantial influence on Indonesian culture.[257][258]\n\n\n\n![](image)Baiturrahman Grand Mosque in Banda Aceh, Aceh. The spread of Islam in Indonesia began in the region.\nIslam was introduced by Sunni traders of the Shafi'i school as well as Sufi traders from the Indian subcontinent and southern Arabia as early as the 8th century CE.[259][260] For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, resulting in a distinct form of Islam (*santri*).[32][261] Trade, Islamic missionary activity such as by the Wali Sanga and Chinese explorer Zheng He, and military campaigns by several sultanates helped accelerate the spread of Islam.[262][263] By the end of the 16th century, it had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion of Java and Sumatra.\n\n\n\n![](image)Catholic Mass at the Jakarta Cathedral\nCatholicism was brought by Portuguese traders and missionaries such as Jesuit Francis Xavier, who visited and baptised several thousand locals.[264][265] Its spread faced difficulty due to the Dutch East India Company policy of banning the religion and the Dutch hostility due to the Eighty Years' War against Catholic Spain's rule. Protestantism is mostly a result of Calvinist and Lutheran missionary efforts during the Dutch colonial era.[266][267][268] Although they are the most common branch, there is a multitude of other denominations elsewhere in the country.[269]\n\n\nThere was a small Jewish presence in the archipelago until 1945, mostly Dutch and some Baghdadi Jews. Since most left after Indonesia proclaimed independence, Judaism was never accorded official status, and only a tiny number of Jews remain today, mostly in Jakarta and Surabaya.[270]\n\n\nAt the national and local level, Indonesia's political leadership and civil society groups have played a crucial role in interfaith relations, both positively and negatively. The invocation of the first principle of Indonesia's philosophical foundation, Pancasila[271][272] (i.e. the belief in the one and only God), often serves as a reminder of religious tolerance,[273] though instances of intolerance have occurred.[274][73] An overwhelming majority of Indonesians consider religion to be essential and an integral part of life.[275][276]\n\n\n\n### Education and health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Indonesia and Health in Indonesia\n\n![](image)University of Indonesia is one of Indonesia's top universities\nEducation is compulsory for 12 years.[277] Parents can choose between state-run, non-sectarian schools or private or semi-private religious (usually Islamic) schools, supervised by the ministries of Education and Religion, respectively.[278] Private international schools that do not follow the national curriculum are also available. The enrolment rate is 93% for primary education, 79% for secondary education, and 36% for tertiary education (2018).[279] The literacy rate is 96% (2018), and the government spends about 3.6% of GDP (2015) on education.[279] In 2018, there were 4,670 higher educational institutions in Indonesia, with most (74%) located in Sumatra and Java.[280][281] According to the QS World University Rankings, Indonesia's top universities are the University of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada University and the Bandung Institute of Technology.[282]\n\n\nGovernment expenditure on healthcare was about 3.3% of GDP in 2016.[283] As part of an attempt to achieve universal health care, the government launched the National Health Insurance (*Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional*, JKN) in 2014.[284] It includes coverage for a range of services from the public and also private firms that have opted to join the scheme. Despite remarkable improvements in recent decades, such as rising life expectancy (from 62.3 years in 1990 to 71.7 years in 2019)[285] and declining child mortality (from 84 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990 to 23.9 deaths in 2019),[286] challenges remain, including maternal and child health, low air quality, malnutrition, high rate of smoking, and infectious diseases.[287]\n\n\n\n### Issues[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Human rights in Indonesia, Organised crime in Indonesia, and Papua conflict\n\n![](image)Riots on the streets of Jakarta on 14 May 1998\nIn the economic sphere, there is a gap in wealth, unemployment rate, and health between densely populated islands and economic centres (such as Sumatra and Java) and sparsely populated, disadvantaged areas (such as Maluku and Papua).[288][289] This is created by a situation in which nearly 80% of Indonesia's population lives in the western parts of the archipelago[290] and yet grows slower than the rest of the country.\n\n\nIn the social arena, numerous cases of racism and discrimination, especially against Chinese Indonesians and Papuans, have been well documented throughout Indonesia's history.[291][292] Such cases have sometimes led to violent conflicts, most notably the May 1998 riots and the Papua conflict, which has continued since 1962. LGBT people also regularly face challenges. Although LGBT issues have been relatively obscure, the 2010s (especially after 2016) has seen a rapid surge of anti-LGBT rhetoric, putting LGBT Indonesians into a frequent subject of intimidation, discrimination, and even violence.[293][294] In addition, Indonesia has been reported to have sizeable numbers of child and forced labourers, with the former being prevalent in the palm oil and tobacco industries, while the latter in the fishing industry.[295][296]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Indonesia\n See also: National Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia and Public holidays in Indonesia\n\nThe cultural history of the Indonesian archipelago spans more than two millennia. Influences from the Indian subcontinent, mainland China, the Middle East, Europe,[297][298] Melanesian and Austronesian peoples have historically shaped the cultural, linguistic and religious makeup of the archipelago. As a result, modern-day Indonesia has a multicultural, multilingual and multi-ethnic society,[1][2] with a complex cultural mixture that differs significantly from the original indigenous cultures. Indonesia currently holds twelve items of UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage, including a wayang puppet theatre, kris, batik,[299] pencak silat, angklung, gamelan, and the three genres of traditional Balinese dance.[300]\n\n\n\n### Art and architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indonesian art and Architecture of Indonesia\n\nFurther information: Indonesian painting\n\n![](image)Traditional Balinese painting depicting cockfighting\nIndonesian arts include both age-old art forms developed through centuries and recently developed contemporary art. Despite often displaying local ingenuity, Indonesian arts have absorbed foreign influences—most notably from India, the Arab world, China and Europe, due to contacts and interactions facilitated, and often motivated by trade.[301] Painting is an established and developed art in Bali, where its people are famed for their artistry. Their painting tradition started as classical Kamasan or Wayang style visual narrative, derived from visual art discovered on *candi* bas reliefs in eastern Java.[302]\n\n\n\n![](image)An avenue of Tongkonan houses in a Torajan village, South Sulawesi\nThere have been numerous discoveries of megalithic sculptures in Indonesia.[303] Subsequently, tribal art has flourished within the culture of Nias, Batak, Asmat, Dayak and Toraja.[304][305] Wood and stone are common materials used as the media for sculpting among these tribes. Between the 8th and 15th centuries, the Javanese civilisation developed refined stone sculpting art and architecture influenced by the Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilisation. The temples of Borobudur and Prambanan are among the most famous examples of the practice.[306]\n\n\nAs with the arts, Indonesian architecture has absorbed foreign influences that have brought cultural changes and profound effects on building styles and techniques. The most dominant has traditionally been Indian; however, Chinese, Arab, and European influences have also been significant. Traditional carpentry, masonry, stone and woodwork techniques and decorations have thrived in vernacular architecture, with numbers of traditional houses' (*rumah adat*) styles that have been developed. The traditional houses and settlements vary by ethnic group, and each has a specific custom and history.[307] Examples include Toraja's Tongkonan, Minangkabau's Rumah Gadang and Rangkiang, Javanese style Pendopo pavilion with Joglo style roof, Dayak's longhouses, various Malay houses, Balinese houses and temples, and also different forms of rice barns (*lumbung*).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Music, dance and clothing[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of Indonesia, Dance in Indonesia, and National costume of Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nIndonesian music and dance. **Clockwise from top**: a gamelan player; Angklung; Sundanese Jaipongan Mojang Priangan dance; and Balinese Pendet dance.\n\nThe music of Indonesia predates historical records. Various indigenous tribes incorporate chants and songs accompanied by musical instruments in their rituals. Angklung, kacapi suling, gong, gamelan, talempong, kulintang, and sasando are examples of traditional Indonesian instruments. The diverse world of Indonesian music genres results from the musical creativity of its people and subsequent cultural encounters with foreign influences. These include gambus and qasida from the Middle East,[308] keroncong from Portugal,[309] and dangdut—one of Indonesia's most popular music genres—with notable Hindi influence as well as Malay orchestras.[310] Today, the Indonesian music industry enjoys both nationwide and regional popularity in Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei,[311][312] due to the common culture and mutual intelligibility between Indonesian and Malay.[313]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cotton wikkelrok with batik geometric pattern\nIndonesian dances have a diverse history, with more than 3,000 original dances. Scholars believe that they had their beginning in rituals and religious worship.[314] Examples include war dances, a dance of witch doctors, and a dance to call for rain or any agricultural rituals such as Hudoq. Indonesian dances derive their influences from the archipelago's prehistoric and tribal, Hindu-Buddhist, and Islamic periods. Recently, modern dances and urban teen dances have gained popularity due to the influence of Western culture and those of Japan and South Korea to some extent. However, various traditional dances, including those of Java, Bali and Dayak, remain a living and dynamic tradition.[315]\n\n\nIndonesia has various clothing styles due to its long and rich cultural history. The national costume originates from the country's indigenous culture and traditional textile traditions. The Javanese Batik and Kebaya[316] are arguably Indonesia's most recognised national costumes, though they have Sundanese and Balinese origins as well.[317] Each province has a representation of traditional attire and dress,[297] such as Ulos of Batak from North Sumatra; Songket of Malay and Minangkabau from Sumatra; and Ikat of Sasak from Lombok. People wear national and regional costumes during traditional weddings, formal ceremonies, music performances, government and official occasions,[317] and they vary from traditional to modern attire.\n\n\n\n### Theatre and cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Theatre of Indonesia and Cinema of Indonesia\n\nFurther information: List of highest-grossing films in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Pandava and Krishna in an act of the *Wayang Wong* performance\nWayang, the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese shadow puppet theatre display several mythological legends such as Ramayana and Mahabharata.[318] Other forms of local drama include the Javanese Ludruk and Ketoprak, the Sundanese Sandiwara, Betawi Lenong,[319][320] and various Balinese dance dramas. They incorporate humour and jest and often involve audiences in their performances.[321] Some theatre traditions also include music, dancing and silat martial art, such as Randai from the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra. It is usually performed for traditional ceremonies and festivals[322][323] and based on semi-historical Minangkabau legends and love story.[323] Modern performing art also developed in Indonesia with its distinct style of drama. Notable theatre, dance, and drama troupe such as *Teater Koma* are famous as it often portrays social and political satire of Indonesian society.[324]\n\n\n\n![](image)Advertisement for *Loetoeng Kasaroeng* (1926), the first fiction film produced in the Dutch East Indies\nThe first film produced in the archipelago was *Loetoeng Kasaroeng*,[325] a silent film by Dutch director L. Heuveldorp. The film industry expanded after independence, with six films made in 1949 rising to 58 in 1955. Usmar Ismail, who made significant imprints in the 1950s and 1960s, is generally considered the pioneer of Indonesian films.[326] The latter part of the Sukarno era saw the use of cinema for nationalistic, anti-Western purposes, and foreign films were subsequently banned, while the New Order utilised a censorship code that aimed to maintain social order.[327] Production of films peaked during the 1980s, although it declined significantly in the next decade.[325] Notable films in this period include *Pengabdi Setan* (1980), *Nagabonar* (1987), *Tjoet Nja' Dhien* (1988), *Catatan Si Boy* (1989), and Warkop's comedy films.\n\n\nIndependent film making was a rebirth of the film industry since 1998, when films started addressing previously banned topics, such as religion, race, and love.[327] Between 2000 and 2005, the number of films released each year steadily increased.[328] Riri Riza and Mira Lesmana were among the new generation of filmmakers who co-directed *Kuldesak* (1999), *Petualangan Sherina* (2000), *Ada Apa dengan Cinta?* (2002), and *Laskar Pelangi* (2008). In 2022, *KKN di Desa Penari* smashed box office records, becoming the most-watched Indonesian film with 9.2 million tickets sold.[329] Indonesia has held annual film festivals and awards, including the Indonesian Film Festival (*Festival Film Indonesia*) held intermittently since 1955. It hands out the Citra Award, the film industry's most prestigious award. From 1973 to 1992, the festival was held annually and then discontinued until its revival in 2004.\n\n\n\n### Mass media and literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mass media in Indonesia and Indonesian literature\n\n![](image)Metro TV at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium, reporting the 2010 AFF Championship\nMedia freedom increased considerably after the fall of the New Order, during which the Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media and restricted foreign media.[330] The television market includes several national commercial networks and provincial networks that compete with public TVRI, which held a monopoly on TV broadcasting from 1962 to 1989. By the early 21st century, the improved communications system had brought television signals to every village, and people can choose from up to 11 channels.[331] Private radio stations carry news bulletins while foreign broadcasters supply programmes. The number of printed publications has increased significantly since 1998.[331]\n\n\nLike other developing countries, Indonesia began developing Internet in the early 1990s. Its first commercial Internet service provider, PT. Indo Internet began operation in Jakarta in 1994.[332] The country had 171 million Internet users in 2018, with a penetration rate that keeps increasing annually.[333] Most are between the ages of 15 and 19 and depend primarily on mobile phones for access, outnumbering laptops and computers.[334]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Indonesia's most famous novelist. Many considered him to be Southeast Asia's leading candidate for a Nobel Prize in Literature.[335]\nThe oldest evidence of writing in the Indonesian archipelago is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century. Many of Indonesia's peoples have firmly rooted oral traditions, which help define and preserve their cultural identities.[336] In written poetry and prose, several traditional forms dominate, mainly syair, pantun, gurindam, hikayat and babad. Examples of these forms include *Syair Abdul Muluk*, *Hikayat Hang Tuah*, *Sulalatus Salatin*, and *Babad Tanah Jawi*.[337]\n\n\nEarly modern Indonesian literature originates in the Sumatran tradition.[338][339] Literature and poetry flourished during the decades leading up to and after independence. Balai Pustaka, the government bureau for popular literature, was instituted in 1917 to promote the development of indigenous literature. Many scholars consider the 1950s and 1960s to be the Golden Age of Indonesian Literature.[340] The style and characteristics of modern Indonesian literature vary according to the dynamics of the country's political and social landscape,[340] most notably the war of independence in the second half of the 1940s and the anti-communist mass killings in the mid-1960s.[341] Notable literary figures of the modern era include Hamka, Chairil Anwar, Mohammad Yamin, Merari Siregar, Marah Roesli, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, and Ayu Utami.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indonesian cuisine\n\n![](image)*Nasi Padang* with *rendang*, *gulai* and vegetables\nIndonesian cuisine is one of the world's most diverse, vibrant, and colourful, full of intense flavour.[342] Many regional cuisines exist, often based upon indigenous culture and foreign influences such as Chinese, European, Middle Eastern, and Indian precedents.[343] Rice is the leading staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables. Spices (notably chilli), coconut milk, fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients.[344]\n\n\nSome popular dishes such as *nasi goreng*, *gado-gado*, *sate*, and *soto* are ubiquitous and considered national dishes. The Ministry of Tourism, however, chose *tumpeng* as the official national dish in 2014, describing it as binding the diversity of various culinary traditions.[345] Other popular dishes include *rendang*, one of the many Minangkabau cuisines along with *dendeng* and *gulai*. Another fermented food is *oncom*, similar in some ways to *tempeh* but uses a variety of bases (not only soy), created by different fungi, and is prevalent in West Java.[346]\n\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sport in Indonesia and Indonesian martial arts\n\n![](image)A demonstration of *Pencak Silat*, a form of martial artsBadminton and football are the most popular sports in Indonesia. Indonesia is among the few countries that have won the Thomas and Uber Cup, the world team championship of men's and women's badminton. Along with weightlifting, it is the sport that contributes the most to Indonesia's Olympic medal tally. Liga 1 is the country's premier football club league. On the international stage, Indonesia was the first Asian team to participate in the FIFA World Cup in 1938 as the Dutch East Indies.[347] On a regional level, Indonesia won a bronze medal at the 1958 Asian Games as well as three gold medals at the 1987, 1991 and 2023 Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games). Indonesia's first appearance at the AFC Asian Cup was in 1996 and successfully qualified for a total of five tournaments, although they never make the knockout phase.[348]\n\n\nOther popular sports include boxing and basketball, which has a long history in Indonesia and was part of the first National Games (*Pekan Olahraga Nasional*, PON) in 1948.[349] *Sepak takraw* and *karapan sapi* (bull racing) in Madura are some examples of Indonesia's traditional sports. In areas with a history of tribal warfare, mock fighting contests are held, such as *caci* in Flores and *pasola* in Sumba. *Pencak Silat* is an Indonesian martial art and, in 2018, became one of the sporting events in the Asian Games, with Indonesia appearing as one of the leading competitors. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia is one of the top sports powerhouses by topping the SEA Games medal table ten times since 1977,[350] most recently in 2011.[351]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n* ![icon](image)Islands portal\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n* List of Indonesia-related topics\n* Index of Indonesia-related articles\n* Outline of Indonesia\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** UK: /ˌɪndəˈniːziə, -ʒə/ *IN-də-NEE-zee-ə, -⁠zhə* US: /ˌɪndəˈniːʒə, -ʃə/ ⓘ *IN-də-NEE-zhə, -⁠shə*;[10][11] Indonesian pronunciation: [ɪndoˈnesia]\n2. **^** *Republik Indonesia* ([reˈpublik ɪndoˈnesia] ⓘ) is the most-used official name, though the name Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia (*Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia*, NKRI) also appears in some official documents.\n3. **^** During the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, Indonesia withdrew from the UN due to the latter's election to the United Nations Security Council, although it returned 18 months later.

It consists of over 17,000 islands, including Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, and parts of Borneo and New Guinea. Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic state and the 14th-largest country by area, at 1,904,569 square kilometres (735,358 square miles). With around 279 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth-most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority country. Java, the world's most populous island, is home to more than half of the country's population.\n\n\nIndonesia is a presidential republic with an elected legislature. It has 38 provinces, of which nine have special status. The country's capital, Jakarta, is the world's second-most populous urban area. Indonesia shares land borders with Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and the eastern part of Malaysia, as well as maritime borders with Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, Palau, and India. Despite its large population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity.\n\n\nThe Indonesian archipelago has been a valuable region for trade since at least the seventh century when the Srivijaya and later Majapahit Kingdoms traded with entities from mainland China and the Indian subcontinent. Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign influences from the early centuries, and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished. Muslim traders later brought Islam, and European powers fought one another to monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery. Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism, Indonesia secured its independence after World War II. Indonesia's history has since been turbulent, with challenges posed by natural disasters, corruption, separatism, a democratisation process, and periods of rapid economic change.\n\n\nIndonesia consists of thousands of distinct native ethnic and hundreds of linguistic groups, with Javanese being the largest. A shared identity has developed with the motto *\"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\"* (\"Unity in Diversity\" *literally*, \"many, yet one\"), defined by a national language, cultural diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. The economy of Indonesia is the world's 16th-largest by nominal GDP and the 7th-largest by PPP. It is the world's third-largest democracy, a regional power and is considered a middle power in global affairs. The country is a member of several multilateral organisations, including the United Nations, World Trade Organization, G20, and a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, East Asia Summit, D-8 and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of Indonesia\n\nThe name *Indonesia* derives from the Greek words *Indos* (Ἰνδός) and *nesos* (νῆσος), meaning \"Indian islands\".[12] The name dates back to the 19th century, far predating the formation of independent Indonesia.[13] In 1850, George Windsor Earl, an English ethnologist, proposed the terms *Indunesians*—and, his preference, *Malayunesians*—for the inhabitants of the \"Indian Archipelago or Malay Archipelago\".[14] In the same publication, one of his students, James Richardson Logan, used *Indonesia* as a synonym for *Indian Archipelago*.[15][16] Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use *Indonesia*. They preferred *Malay Archipelago* (Dutch: *Maleische Archipel*); the *Netherlands East Indies* (*Nederlandsch Oost Indië*), popularly *Indië*; *the East* (*de Oost*); and *Insulinde*.[17]\n\n\nAfter 1900, *Indonesia* became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands, and native nationalist groups adopted it for political expression.[17] Adolf Bastian of the University of Berlin popularized the name through his book *Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayischen Archipels, 1884–1894*. The first native scholar to use the name was Ki Hajar Dewantara when in 1913, he established a press bureau in the Netherlands, *Indonesisch Pers-bureau*.[13]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Indonesia\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Borobudur ship carved on Borobudur temple, c. 800 CE. Outrigger boats from the archipelago may have made trade voyages to the east coast of Africa and Madagascar as early as the 1st century CE.[18]\nFossilised remains of *Homo erectus*, popularly known as the \"Java Man\", suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago.[19][20][21] *Homo sapiens* reached the region around 43,000 BCE.[22] Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population, migrated to Southeast Asia from what is now Taiwan. They arrived in the archipelago around 2,000 BCE and confined the native Melanesians to the far eastern regions as they spread east.[23]\n\n\nIdeal agricultural conditions and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE[24] allowed villages, towns, and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE. The archipelago's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade, including with Indian kingdoms and Chinese dynasties, from several centuries BCE.[25] Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history.[26][27]\n\n\nFrom the seventh century CE, the Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished due to trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism.[28][29] Between the eighth and tenth centuries CE, the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java, leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra's Borobudur and Mataram's Prambanan. The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century, and under Gajah Mada, its influence stretched over much of present-day Indonesia. This period is often referred to as a \"Golden Age\" in Indonesian history.[30]\n\n\nThe earliest evidence of Islamized populations in the archipelago dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra.[31] Other parts of the archipelago gradually adopted Islam, and it was the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century. For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia, particularly in Java.[32]\n\n\n\n### Colonial era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dutch East Indies\n\n![](image)The submission of Prince Diponegoro to General De Kock at the end of the Java War in 1830\nThe first Europeans arrived in the archipelago in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by Francisco Serrão, sought to monopolise the sources of nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in the Maluku Islands.[33] Dutch and British traders followed. In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and became the dominant European power for almost 200 years. The VOC was dissolved in 1799 following bankruptcy, and the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalised colony.[34]\n\n\nFor most of the colonial period, Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous. Dutch forces were engaged continuously in quelling rebellions on and off Java. The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java, Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra, Pattimura in Maluku, and the bloody thirty-year Aceh War weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces.[35][36][37] Only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia's current boundaries.[37][38][39][40]\n\n\nThe Japanese invasion and occupation during World War II ended Dutch rule[41][42][43] and encouraged the independence movement.[44] Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta issued the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence. Then, Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta and Sutan Sjahrir, influential nationalist leaders, were appointed president, vice-president and prime minister respectively.[45][46][47][45]\n\n\nThe Netherlands attempted to re-establish their rule, beginning the Indonesian National Revolution which ended in December 1949 when the Dutch recognised Indonesian independence in the face of international pressure.[48][47] Despite extraordinary political, social, and sectarian divisions, Indonesians, on the whole, found unity in their fight for independence.[49][50]\n\n\n\n### Post-World War II[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSukarno (*left*) and Hatta (*right*), Indonesia's founding fathers and the first President and Vice President respectively\n\nAs president, Sukarno moved Indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism and maintained power by balancing the opposing forces of the military, political Islam, and the increasingly powerful Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI).[51] Tensions between the military and the PKI culminated in an attempted coup in 1965. The army, led by Major General Suharto, countered by instigating a violent anti-communist purge that killed between 500,000 and one million people and incarcerated roughly a million more in concentration camps.[52][53][54][55] The PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed.[56][57][58] Suharto capitalised on Sukarno's weakened position, and following a drawn-out power play with Sukarno, Suharto was appointed president in March 1968. His \"New Order\" administration,[59] supported by the United States,[60][61][62] encouraged foreign direct investment,[63][64][65] which was a crucial factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth.\n\n\nIndonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[66] It brought out popular discontent with the New Order's corruption and suppression of political opposition and ultimately ended Suharto's presidency.[41][67][68][69] In 1999, East Timor seceded from Indonesia, following its 1975 invasion by Indonesia[70] and a 25-year occupation marked by international condemnation of human rights abuses.[71]\n\n\nSince 1998, democratic processes have been strengthened by enhancing regional autonomy and instituting the country's first direct presidential election in 2004.[72] Political, economic and social instability, corruption, and instances of terrorism remained problems in the 2000s; however, the economy has performed strongly since 2007. Although relations among the diverse population are mostly harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problematic in some areas.[73] A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005.[74]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Indonesia and List of islands of Indonesia\n\n![](image)Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java.

A transcontinental country spanning Southeast Asia and Oceania, it is the world's largest archipelagic state, extending 5,120 kilometres (3,181 mi) from east to west and 1,760 kilometres (1,094 mi) from north to south.[75] The country's Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investments Affairs says Indonesia has 17,504 islands (with 16,056 registered at the UN)[76] scattered over both sides of the equator, around 6,000 of which are inhabited.[77] The largest are Sumatra, Java, Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia), Sulawesi, and New Guinea (shared with Papua New Guinea).[78] Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on Borneo and Sebatik, Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea, East Timor on the island of Timor, and maritime borders with Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Palau, and Australia.\n\n\nAt 4,884 metres (16,024 ft), Puncak Jaya is Indonesia's highest peak, and Lake Toba in Sumatra is the largest lake, with an area of 1,145 km2 (442 sq mi). Indonesia's largest rivers are in Kalimantan and New Guinea and include Kapuas, Barito, Mamberamo, Sepik and Mahakam. They serve as communication and transport links between the island's river settlements.[79]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Climate of Indonesia and Climate change in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Rainforest in Mount Palung National Park, West Kalimantan\nIndonesia lies along the equator, and its climate tends to be relatively even year-round.[80] Indonesia has two seasons—a wet season and a dry season—with no extremes of summer or winter.[81] For most of Indonesia, the dry season falls between May and October, with the wet season between November and April.[81] Indonesia's climate is almost entirely tropical, dominated by the tropical rainforest climate found on every large island of Indonesia. More cooling climate types do exist in mountainous regions that are 1,300 to 1,500 metres (4,300 to 4,900 feet) above sea level. The oceanic climate (Köppen *Cfb*) prevails in highland areas adjacent to rainforest climates, with reasonably uniform precipitation year-round. In highland areas near the tropical monsoon and tropical savanna climates, the subtropical highland climate (Köppen *Cwb*) is prevalent with a more pronounced dry season.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Köppen-Geiger climate classification map of Indonesia[82]\nSome regions, such as Kalimantan and Sumatra, experience only slight differences in rainfall and temperature between the seasons, whereas others, such as Nusa Tenggara, experience far more pronounced differences with droughts in the dry season and floods in the wet. Rainfall varies across regions, with more in western Sumatra, Java, and the interiors of Kalimantan and Papua, and less in areas closer to Australia, such as Nusa Tenggara, which tends to be dry. The almost uniformly warm waters that constitute 81% of Indonesia's area ensure that land temperatures remain relatively constant. Humidity is quite high, at between 70 and 90%. Winds are moderate and generally predictable, with monsoons usually blowing in from the south and east in June through October and from the northwest in November through March. Typhoons and large-scale storms pose little hazard to mariners; significant dangers come from swift currents in channels, such as the Lombok and Sape straits.[83]\n\n\nSeveral studies consider Indonesia to be at severe risk from the projected effects of climate change.[84] These include unreduced emissions resulting in an average temperature rise of around 1 °C (2 °F) by mid-century,[85][86] raising the frequency of drought and food shortages (with an impact on precipitation and the patterns of wet and dry seasons, and thus Indonesia's agriculture system[86]) as well as numerous diseases and wildfires.[86] Rising sea levels would also threaten most of Indonesia's population, who live in low-lying coastal areas.[86][87][88] Impoverished communities would likely be affected the most by climate change.[89]\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of Indonesia\n See also: Volcanoes of Indonesia\n\n![](image)Major volcanoes in Indonesia. Indonesia is in the Pacific Ring of Fire area.\nTectonically, most of Indonesia's area is highly unstable, making it a site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes.[90] It lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the Indo-Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate are pushed under the Eurasian plate, where they melt at about 100 kilometres (62 miles) deep. A string of volcanoes runs through Sumatra, Java, Bali and Nusa Tenggara, and then to the Banda Islands of Maluku to northeastern Sulawesi.[91] Of the 400 volcanoes, around 130 are active.[90] Between 1972 and 1991, there were 29 volcanic eruptions, mostly on Java.[92] Volcanic ash has made agricultural conditions unpredictable in some areas.[93] However, it has also resulted in fertile soils, a factor in historically sustaining the high population densities of Java and Bali.[94]\n\n\nA massive supervolcano erupted at present-day Lake Toba around 70,000 BCE. It is believed to have caused a global volcanic winter and cooling of the climate and subsequently led to a genetic bottleneck in human evolution, though this is still in debate.[95] The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora and the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa were among the largest in recorded history. The former caused 92,000 deaths and created an umbrella of volcanic ash that spread and blanketed parts of the archipelago and made much of the Northern Hemisphere without summer in 1816.[96] The latter produced the loudest sound in recorded history and caused 36,000 deaths due to the eruption itself and the resulting tsunamis, with significant additional effects around the world years after the event.[97] Recent catastrophic disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Fauna of Indonesia, Flora of Indonesia, and Protected areas of Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSpecies endemic to Indonesia. **Clockwise from top**: *Rafflesia arnoldii*; orangutan; greater bird-of-paradise; and Komodo dragon.\n\nIndonesia's size, tropical climate, and archipelagic geography support one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity, and it is among the 17 megadiverse countries identified by Conservation International. Its flora and fauna are a mixture of Asian and Australasian species.[98][99] The Sunda Shelf islands (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Bali) were once linked to mainland Asia and have a wealth of Asian fauna. Large species such as the Sumatran tiger, rhinoceros, orangutan, Asian elephant, and leopard were once abundant as far east as Bali, but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically. Having been long separated from the continental landmasses, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku have developed their unique flora and fauna.[100][101] Papua was part of the Australian landmass and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia, including over 600 bird species.[102]\n\n\nIndonesia is second only to Australia in terms of total endemic species, with 36% of its 1,531 species of bird and 39% of its 515 species of mammal being endemic.[103] Tropical seas surround Indonesia's 80,000 kilometres (50,000 miles) of coastline. The country has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems, including beaches, dunes, estuaries, mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, coastal mudflats, tidal flats, algal beds, and small island ecosystems.[12] Indonesia is one of the Coral Triangle countries with the world's most enormous diversity of coral reef fish, with more than 1,650 species in eastern Indonesia only.[104]\n\n\nBritish naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace described a dividing line (Wallace Line) between the distribution of Indonesia's Asian and Australasian species.[105] It runs roughly north–south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf, between Kalimantan and Sulawesi, and along the deep Lombok Strait, between Lombok and Bali. Flora and fauna on the west of the line are generally Asian, while east from Lombok is increasingly Australian until the tipping point at the Weber Line. In his 1869 book, *The Malay Archipelago*, Wallace described numerous species unique to the area.[106] The region of islands between his line and New Guinea is now termed Wallacea.[105]\n\n\n\n![](image)Deforestation in Riau province, Sumatra, to make way for an oil palm plantation (2007)\nIndonesia's large and growing population and rapid industrialisation present serious environmental issues. They are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance.[107] Problems include the destruction of peatlands, large-scale illegal deforestation (causing extensive haze across parts of Southeast Asia), over-exploitation of marine resources, air pollution, garbage management, and reliable water and wastewater services.[107] These issues contribute to Indonesia's low ranking (number 116 out of 180 countries) in the 2020 Environmental Performance Index. The report also indicates that Indonesia's performance is generally below average in both regional and global context.[108]\n\n\nIndonesia has one of the world's fastest deforestation rates.[109][110] In 2020, forests covered approximately 49.1% of the country's land area,[111] down from 87% in 1950.[112] Since the 1970s, log production, various plantations and agriculture have been responsible for much of the deforestation in Indonesia.[112] Most recently, it has been driven by the palm oil industry,[113] which has been criticised for its environmental impact and displacement of local communities.[110][114] The situation has made Indonesia the world's largest forest-based emitter of greenhouse gases.[115] It also threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) identified 140 species of mammals as threatened and 15 as critically endangered, including the Bali myna,[116] Sumatran orangutan,[117] and Javan rhinoceros.[118] Some academics describe the deforestation and other environmental destruction in the country as an ecocide.[119][120][121]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Indonesia\n\n![](image)A presidential inauguration by the MPR in the Parliament Complex Jakarta, 2014\nIndonesia is a republic with a presidential system. Following the fall of the New Order in 1998, political and governmental structures have undergone sweeping reforms, with four constitutional amendments revamping the executive, legislative and judicial branches.[122] Chief among them is the delegation of power and authority to various regional entities while remaining a unitary state.[123] The President of Indonesia is the head of state and head of government, commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (*Tentara Nasional Indonesia*, TNI), and the director of domestic governance, policy-making, and foreign affairs. The president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms.[124]\n\n\nThe highest representative body at the national level is the People's Consultative Assembly (*Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat*, MPR). Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution, inaugurating and impeaching the president,[125][126] and formalising broad outlines of state policy. The MPR comprises two houses; the People's Representative Council (*Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat*, DPR), with 575 members, and the Regional Representative Council (*Dewan Perwakilan Daerah*, DPD), with 136.[127] The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch. Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased its role in national governance,[122] while the DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management.[128][126]\n\n\nMost civil disputes appear before the State Court (*Pengadilan Negeri*); appeals are heard before the High Court (*Pengadilan Tinggi*). The Supreme Court of Indonesia (*Mahkamah Agung*) is the highest level of the judicial branch and hears final cessation appeals and conducts case reviews. Other courts include the Constitutional Court (*Mahkamah Konstitusi*) which listens to constitutional and political matters, and the Religious Court (*Pengadilan Agama*), which deals with codified Islamic Personal Law (*sharia*) cases.[129] Additionally, the Judicial Commission (*Komisi Yudisial*) monitors the performance of judges.[130]\n\n\n\n### Parties and elections[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of political parties in Indonesia and Elections in Indonesia\n\n![](image)\nJoko Widodo,  \n 7th President of Indonesia\n![](image)\nMa'ruf Amin,  \n 13th Vice President of Indonesia\n\nSince 1999, Indonesia has had a multi-party system. In all legislative elections since the fall of the New Order, no political party has won an overall majority of seats. The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), which secured the most votes in the 2019 elections, is the party of the incumbent president, Joko Widodo.[131] Other notable parties include the Party of the Functional Groups (*Golkar*), the Great Indonesia Movement Party (*Gerindra*), the Democratic Party, and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS).\n\n\nThe first general election was held in 1955 to elect members of the DPR and the Constitutional Assembly (*Konstituante*). The most recent elections in 2019 resulted in nine political parties in the DPR, with a parliamentary threshold of 4% of the national vote.[132] At the national level, Indonesians did not elect a president until 2004. Since then, the president is elected for a five-year term, as are the party-aligned members of the DPR and the non-partisan DPD.[127][122] Beginning with the 2015 local elections, elections for governors and mayors have occurred on the same date. In 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that legislative and presidential elections would be held simultaneously, starting in 2019.[133]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Subdivisions of Indonesia\n\nIndonesia has several levels of subdivisions. The first level are the provinces, which have a legislature (*Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah*, DPRD) and an elected governor. A total of 38 provinces have been established from the original eight in 1945,[134] with the most recent change being the split of Southwest Papua from the province of West Papua in 2022.[135] The second level are the regencies (*kabupaten*) and cities (*kota*), led by regents (*bupati*) and mayors (*walikota*) respectively and a legislature (*DPRD Kabupaten/Kota*). The third level are the districts (*kecamatan*, *distrik* in Papua, or *kapanewon* and *kemantren* in Yogyakarta), and the fourth are the villages (either *desa*, *kelurahan*, *kampung*, *nagari* in West Sumatra, or *gampong* in Aceh).[136]\n\n\nThe village is the lowest level of government administration. It is divided into several community groups (*rukun warga*, RW), which are further divided into neighbourhood groups (*rukun tetangga*, RT). In Java, the village (*desa*) is divided into smaller units called *dusun* or *dukuh* (hamlets), which are the same as RW. Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001, regencies and cities have become chief administrative units responsible for providing most government services. The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen's daily life and handles village or neighbourhood matters through an elected village head (*lurah* or *kepala desa*).[137]\n\n\nNine provinces—Aceh, Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, Southwest Papua and West Papua—are granted a special autonomous status (*otonomi khusus*) from the central government. A conservative Islamic territory, Aceh has the right to create some aspects of an independent legal system implementing *sharia*.[138] Jakarta is the only city with a provincial government due to its position as the capital of Indonesia.[139][140] Yogyakarta is the only pre-colonial monarchy legally recognised within Indonesia, with the positions of governor and vice governor being prioritised for the reigning Sultan of Yogyakarta and Duke of Pakualaman, respectively.[141] The six Papuan provinces are the only ones where the indigenous people have privileges in their local government.[142]\n\n\n\nThis section is transcluded from Template:Indonesia provinces labelled map.

Numerous attempts by the United States and the Soviet Union,[146][147] and China to some degree,[148] culminated in the 1965 coup attempt and subsequent upheaval that led to a reorientation of foreign policy.[149] Quiet alignment with the Western world while maintaining a non-aligned stance has characterised Indonesia's foreign policy since then.[150] Today, it maintains close relations with its neighbours and is a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the East Asia Summit. In common with most of the Muslim world, Indonesia does not have diplomatic relations with Israel and has actively supported Palestine. However, observers have pointed out that Indonesia has ties with Israel, albeit discreetly.[151]\n\n\nIndonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950[c] and was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).[153] Indonesia is a signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement, the Cairns Group, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and a former member of OPEC.[154] Indonesia has been a humanitarian and development aid recipient since 1967,[155][156] and recently, the country established its first overseas aid programme in late 2019.[157]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indonesian National Armed Forces and Military history of Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nIndonesian Armed Forces. **Clockwise from top**: Indonesian Army during training session; Sukhoi Su-30; Pindad Anoa; and Indonesian naval vessel Error: {{Ship}} invalid control parameter: 4 (help).\n\nIndonesia's Armed Forces (TNI) include the Army (TNI–AD), Navy (TNI–AL, which includes Marine Corps), and Air Force (TNI–AU). The army has about 400,000 active-duty personnel. Defence spending in the national budget was 0.7% of GDP in 2018,[158] with controversial involvement of military-owned commercial interests and foundations.[159] The Armed Forces were formed during the Indonesian National Revolution when it undertook guerrilla warfare along with informal militia. Since then, territorial lines have formed the basis of all TNI branches' structure, aimed at maintaining domestic stability and deterring foreign threats.[160] The military has possessed a strong political influence since its founding, which peaked during the New Order. Political reforms in 1998 included the removal of the TNI's formal representation from the legislature. Nevertheless, its political influence remains, albeit at a reduced level.[161]\n\n\nSince independence, the country has struggled to maintain unity against local insurgencies and separatist movements.[162] Some, notably in Aceh and Papua, have led to an armed conflict and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides.[163][164][165] The former was resolved peacefully in 2005,[74] while the latter has continued amid a significant, albeit imperfect, implementation of regional autonomy laws and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses as of 2006.[166] Other engagements of the army include the conflict against the Netherlands over the Dutch New Guinea, the opposition to the British-sponsored creation of Malaysia (\"Konfrontasi\"), the mass killings of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), and the invasion of East Timor, which remains Indonesia's most massive military operation.[167][168]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Indonesia and Economic history of Indonesia\n\nSee also: Agriculture in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Vast palm oil plantation in Bogor Regency, West Java. Indonesia is the world's largest producer of palm oil.[169]\nIndonesia has a mixed economy in which the private sector and government play vital roles.[170] As the only G20 member state in Southeast Asia,[171] the country has the largest economy in the region and is classified as a newly industrialised country. Per a 2023 estimate, it is the world's 16th largest economy by nominal GDP and 7th in terms of GDP at PPP, estimated to be US$1.417 trillion and US$4.393 trillion, respectively. Per capita GDP in PPP is US$15,835, while nominal per capita GDP is US$5,108.[7] Services are the economy's largest sector and account for 43.4% of GDP (2018), followed by industry (39.7%) and agriculture (12.8%).[172] Since 2009, it has employed more people than other sectors, accounting for 47.7% of the total labour force, followed by agriculture (30.2%) and industry (21.9%).[173]\n\n\nOver time, the structure of the economy has changed considerably.[174] Historically, it has been weighted heavily towards agriculture, reflecting both its stage of economic development and government policies in the 1950s and 1960s to promote agricultural self-sufficiency.[174] A gradual process of industrialisation and urbanisation began in the late 1960s and accelerated in the 1980s as falling oil prices saw the government focus on diversifying away from oil exports and towards manufactured exports.[174] This development continued throughout the 1980s and into the next decade despite the 1990 oil price shock, during which the GDP rose at an average rate of 7.1%. As a result, the official poverty rate fell from 60% to 15%.[175] Trade barriers reduction from the mid-1980s made the economy more globally integrated. The growth ended with the 1997 Asian financial crisis that severely impacted the economy, including a 13.1% real GDP contraction in 1998 and a 78% inflation. The economy reached its low point in mid-1999 with only 0.8% real GDP growth.[176]\n\n\nRelatively steady inflation[177] and an increase in GDP deflator and the Consumer Price Index[178] have contributed to strong economic growth in recent years. From 2007 to 2019, annual growth accelerated to between 4% and 6% due to improvements in the banking sector and domestic consumption,[179] helping Indonesia weather the 2008–2009 Great Recession,[180] and regain in 2011 the investment grade rating it had lost in 1997.[181] As of 2019[update], 9.41% of the population lived below the poverty line, and the official open unemployment rate was 5.28%.[182] During the first year of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the economy suffered its first recession since the 1997 crisis but recovered in the following year.[183]\n\n\nIndonesia has abundant natural resources. Its primary industries are fishing, petroleum, timber, paper products, cotton cloth, tourism, petroleum mining, natural gas, bauxite, coal and tin. Its main agricultural products are rice, coconuts, soybeans, bananas, coffee, tea, palm, rubber, and sugar cane.[184] These commodities make up a large portion of the country's exports, with palm oil and coal briquettes as the leading export commodities. In addition to refined and crude petroleum as the primary imports, telephones, vehicle parts and wheat cover the majority of additional imports. China, the United States, Japan, Singapore, India, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand are Indonesia's principal export markets and import partners.[185]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nTransport modes in Indonesia. **Clockwise from top**: TransJakarta bus; Whoosh high-speed train; Garuda Indonesia airliner; and Pelni ship.\n\nIndonesia's transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipelago and the distribution of its 275 million people highly concentrated on Java.[186] All transport modes play a role in the country's transport system and are generally complementary rather than competitive. In 2016, the transport sector generated about 5.2% of GDP.[187]\n\n\nThe road transport system is predominant, with a total length of 542,310 kilometres (336,980 miles) as of 2018[update].[188] Jakarta has the most extended bus rapid transit system globally, boasting 251.2 kilometres (156.1 miles) in 13 corridors and ten cross-corridor routes.[189] Rickshaws such as *bajaj* and *becak* and share taxis such as *Angkot* and *Minibus* are a regular sight in the country.\n\n\nMost railways are in Java, and partly Sumatra and Sulawesi,[190] used for freight and passenger transport, such as local commuter rail services (mainly in Greater Jakarta and Yogyakarta–Solo) complementing the inter-city rail network in several cities. In the late 2010s, Jakarta and Palembang were the first cities in Indonesia to have rapid transit systems, with more planned for other cities in the future.[191] In 2023, a high-speed rail connecting the cities of Jakarta and Bandung commenced operations, a first for Southeast Asia and the Southern Hemisphere.[192]\n\n\nIndonesia's largest airport, Soekarno–Hatta International Airport, is among the busiest in the Southern Hemisphere, serving 54 million passengers in 2019. Ngurah Rai International Airport and Juanda International Airport are the country's second-and third-busiest airport, respectively. Garuda Indonesia, the country's flag carrier since 1949, is one of the world's leading airlines and a member of the global airline alliance SkyTeam. The Port of Tanjung Priok is the busiest and most advanced Indonesian port,[193] handling more than 50% of Indonesia's trans-shipment cargo traffic.\n\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Sidrap wind farm, Indonesia's first wind power plant, in Sidrap Regency, South Sulawesi\nIn 2019, Indonesia produced 4,999 terawatt-hours (17.059 quadrillion British thermal units) and consumed 2,357 terawatt-hours (8.043 quadrillion British thermal units) worth of energy.[194] The country has substantial energy resources, including 22 billion barrels (3.5 billion cubic metres) of conventional oil and gas reserves (of which about 4 billion barrels are recoverable), 8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent of coal-based methane (CBM) resources, and 28 billion tonnes of recoverable coal.[195]\n\n\nIn late 2020, Indonesia's total national installed power generation capacity stands at 72,750.72 MW.[196] Although reliance on domestic coal and imported oil has increased between 2010 and 2019,[194][197] Indonesia has seen progress in renewable energy, with hydropower and geothermal being the most abundant sources that account for more than 8% in the country's energy mix.[194] A prime example of the former is the country's largest dam, Jatiluhur, which has an installed capacity of 186.5 MW that feeds into the Java grid managed by the State Electricity Company (*Perusahaan Listrik Negara*, PLN). Furthermore, Indonesia has the potential for solar, wind, biomass and ocean energy,[198] although as of 2021, power generation from these sources remain small.\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Palapa satellite launch in 1984\nGovernment expenditure on research and development is relatively low (0.3% of GDP in 2019),[199] and Indonesia only ranked 61st on the 2023 Global Innovation Index report up from 87th in 2021.[200][201] Historical examples of scientific and technological developments include the paddy cultivation technique *terasering*, which is common in Southeast Asia, and the pinisi boats by the Bugis and Makassar people.[202] In the 1980s, Indonesian engineer Tjokorda Raka Sukawati invented a road construction technique named Sosrobahu that later became widely used in several countries.[203] The country is also an active producer of passenger trains and freight wagons with its state-owned company, the Indonesian Railway Industry (INKA), and has exported trains abroad.[204]\n\n\nIndonesia has a long history of developing military and small commuter aircraft. It is the only country in Southeast Asia to build and produce aircraft. The state-owned Indonesian Aerospace company (*PT. Dirgantara Indonesia*) has provided components for Boeing and Airbus.[205] The company also collaborated with EADS CASA of Spain to develop the CN-235, which has been used by several countries.[206] Former President B. J. Habibie played a vital role in this achievement.[207] Indonesia has also joined the South Korean programme to manufacture the 4.5-generation fighter jet KAI KF-21 Boramae.[208]\n\n\nIndonesia has a space programme and space agency, the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (*Lembaga Penerbangan dan Antariksa Nasional*, LAPAN). In the 1970s, Indonesia became the first developing country to operate a satellite system called Palapa,[209] a series of communication satellites owned by Indosat. The first satellite, PALAPA A1, was launched on 8 July 1976 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, United States.[210] As of 2019[update], Indonesia has launched 18 satellites for various purposes.[211]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Indonesia\n![](image)Borobudur in Central Java, the world's largest Buddhist temple, is the single most visited tourist attraction in Indonesia.[212]\nTourism contributed around US$9.8 billion to GDP in 2020, and in the previous year, Indonesia received 15.4 million visitors.[213] Overall, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and Japan are the top five sources of visitors to Indonesia.[214] Since 2011, *Wonderful Indonesia* has been the country's international marketing campaign slogan to promote tourism.[215]\n\n\n\n![](image)Raja Ampat Islands, West Papua, has the highest recorded level of diversity in marine life, according to Conservation International.[216]\nNature and culture are prime attractions of Indonesian tourism. The country has a well-preserved natural ecosystem with rainforests stretching over about 57% of Indonesia's land (225 million acres). Forests on Sumatra and Kalimantan are examples of popular destinations, such as the Orangutan wildlife reserve. Moreover, Indonesia has one of the world's longest coastlines, measuring 54,716 kilometres (33,999 mi). The ancient Borobudur and Prambanan temples, as well as Toraja and Bali with their traditional festivities, are some of the popular destinations for cultural tourism.[217]\n\n\nIndonesia has nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Komodo National Park and the Sawahlunto Coal Mine; and a further 19 in a tentative list that includes Bunaken National Park and Raja Ampat Islands.[218] Other attractions include specific points in Indonesian history, such as the colonial heritage of the Dutch East Indies in the old towns of Jakarta and Semarang and the royal palaces of Pagaruyung, Ubud, and Yogyakarta.[217]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Indonesia and Indonesians\n\nSee also: List of Indonesian cities by population and List of metropolitan areas in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Indonesia's ten metropolitan areas labeled with their populations\nThe 2020 census recorded Indonesia's population as 270.2 million, the fourth largest in the world, with a moderately high population growth rate of 1.25%.[219] Java is the world's most populous island,[220] where 56% of the country's population lives.[6] The population density is 141 people per km2 (365 per sq mi),[6] ranking 88th in the world, although Java has a population density of 1,067 people per km2 (2,435 per sq mi). In 1961, the first post-colonial census recorded a total of 97 million people.[221] It is expected to grow to around 295 million by 2030 and 321 million by 2050.[222] The country currently possesses a relatively young population, with a median age of 30.2 years (2017 estimate).[77]\n\n\nThe spread of the population is uneven throughout the archipelago, with a varying habitats and levels of development, ranging from the megacity of Jakarta to uncontacted tribes in Papua.[223] As of 2017, about 54.7% of the population lives in urban areas.[224] Jakarta is the country's primate city and the second-most populous urban area globally, with over 34 million residents.[225] About 8 million Indonesians live overseas; most settled in Malaysia, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, South Africa, Singapore, Hong Kong, the United States, and Australia.[226]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities in Indonesia2023 BPS estimate\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Jakarta](image)Jakarta![Surabaya](image)Surabaya | 1 | Jakarta | Special Capital Region of Jakarta | 11,350,328 | 11 | South Tangerang | Banten | 1,404,785\n | ![Bekasi](image)Bekasi![Bandung](image)Bandung |\n| 2 | Surabaya | East Java | 3,009,286 | 12 | Batam | Riau Islands | 1,269,820\n |\n| 3 | Bekasi | West Java | 2,627,207 | 13 | Bandar Lampung | Lampung | 1,209,937\n |\n| 4 | Bandung | West Java | 2,506,603 | 14 | Bogor | West Java | 1,127,408\n |\n| 5 | Medan | North Sumatra | 2,494,512 | 15 | Pekanbaru | Riau | 1,007,540\n |\n| 6 | Depok | West Java | 2,145,400 | 16 | Padang | West Sumatra | 919,145\n |\n| 7 | Tangerang | Banten | 1,912,679 | 17 | Malang | East Java | 847,182\n |\n| 8 | Palembang | South Sumatra | 1,729,546 | 18 | Samarinda | East Kalimantan | 834,824\n |\n| 9 | Semarang | Central Java | 1,694,740 | 19 | Tasikmalaya | West Java | 741,760\n |\n| 10 | Makassar | South Sulawesi | 1,474,393 | 20 | Denpasar | Bali | 726,808\n |\n\n### Ethnic groups and languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ethnic groups in Indonesia, Native Indonesians, and Languages of Indonesia\n\n![](image)A map of ethnic groups in Indonesia\nIndonesia is an ethnically diverse country, with around 1,300 distinct native ethnic groups.[2] Most Indonesians are descended from Austronesian peoples whose languages had origins in Proto-Austronesian, which possibly originated in what is now Taiwan. Another major grouping is the Melanesians, who inhabit eastern Indonesia (the Maluku Islands, Western New Guinea and the eastern part of the Lesser Sunda Islands).[23][227][228][229]\n\n\nThe Javanese are the largest ethnic group, constituting 40.2% of the population,[2] and are politically dominant.[230] They are predominantly located in the central to eastern parts of Java and also in sizeable numbers in most provinces. The Sundanese are the next largest group (15.4%), followed by Batak, Madurese, Betawi, Minangkabau, Bugis and Malay people.[d] A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strong regional identities.[231]\n\n\nThe country's official language is Indonesian, a variant of Malay based on its prestige dialect, which had been the archipelago's *lingua franca* for centuries. It was promoted by nationalists in the 1920s and achieved official status in 1945 under the name *Bahasa Indonesia*.[232] Due to centuries-long contact with other languages, it is rich in local and foreign influences.[e] Nearly every Indonesian speaks the language due to its widespread use in education, academics, communications, business, politics, and mass media. Most Indonesians also speak at least one of more than 700 local languages,[1] often as their first language. Most belong to the Austronesian language family, while over 270 Papuan languages are spoken in eastern Indonesia.[1] Of these, Javanese is the most widely spoken[77] and has co-official status in the Special Region of Yogyakarta.[236]\n\n\nIn 1930, Dutch and other Europeans (*Totok*), Eurasians, and derivative people like the Indos, numbered 240,000 or 0.4% of the total population.[237] Historically, they constituted only a tiny fraction of the native population and remain so today. Also, the Dutch language never had a substantial number of speakers or official status despite the Dutch presence for almost 350 years.[238] The small minorities that can speak it or Dutch-based creole languages fluently are the aforementioned ethnic groups and descendants of Dutch colonisers. This reflected the Dutch colonial empire's primary purpose, which was commercial exchange as opposed to sovereignty over homogeneous landmasses.[239] Today, there is some degree of fluency by either educated members of the oldest generation or legal professionals,[240] as specific law codes are still only available in Dutch.[241]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Indonesia\n\nDespite guaranteeing religious freedom in the constitution,[242][126] the government officially recognises only six religions: Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism,[243][244] with indigenous religions only partly acknowledged.[244] With 231 million adherents (86.7%) in 2018, Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority country,[245][246] with Sunnis being the majority (99%).[247] The Shias and Ahmadis, respectively, constitute 1% (1–3 million) and 0.2% (200,000–400,000) of Muslims.[244][248] About 10% of Indonesians are Christians, who form the majority in several provinces in eastern Indonesia.[249] Most Hindus are Balinese,[250] and most Buddhists are Chinese Indonesians.[251]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Hindu prayer ceremony at Besakih Temple in Bali, the only Indonesian province where Hinduism is the predominant religion\nThe natives of the Indonesian archipelago originally practised indigenous animism and dynamism, beliefs that are common to Austronesian peoples.[252] They worshipped and revered ancestral spirits and believed that supernatural spirits (*hyang*) might inhabit certain places such as large trees, stones, forests, mountains, or sacred sites.[252] Examples of Indonesian native belief systems include the Sundanese Sunda Wiwitan, Dayak's Kaharingan, and the Javanese Kejawèn. They have significantly impacted how other faiths are practised, evidenced by a large proportion of people—such as the Javanese abangan, Balinese Hindus, and Dayak Christians—practising a less orthodox, syncretic form of their religion.[253]\n\n\nHindu influences reached the archipelago as early as the first century CE.[254] The Sundanese Kingdom of Salakanagara in western Java around 130 was the first historically recorded Indianised kingdom in the archipelago.[255] Buddhism arrived around the 6th century,[256] and its history in Indonesia is closely related to that of Hinduism, as some empires based on Buddhism had their roots around the same period. The archipelago has witnessed the rise and fall of powerful and influential Hindu and Buddhist empires such as Majapahit, Sailendra, Srivijaya, and Mataram. Though no longer a majority, Hinduism and Buddhism remain to have a substantial influence on Indonesian culture.[257][258]\n\n\n\n![](image)Baiturrahman Grand Mosque in Banda Aceh, Aceh. The spread of Islam in Indonesia began in the region.\nIslam was introduced by Sunni traders of the Shafi'i school as well as Sufi traders from the Indian subcontinent and southern Arabia as early as the 8th century CE.[259][260] For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, resulting in a distinct form of Islam (*santri*).[32][261] Trade, Islamic missionary activity such as by the Wali Sanga and Chinese explorer Zheng He, and military campaigns by several sultanates helped accelerate the spread of Islam.[262][263] By the end of the 16th century, it had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion of Java and Sumatra.\n\n\n\n![](image)Catholic Mass at the Jakarta Cathedral\nCatholicism was brought by Portuguese traders and missionaries such as Jesuit Francis Xavier, who visited and baptised several thousand locals.[264][265] Its spread faced difficulty due to the Dutch East India Company policy of banning the religion and the Dutch hostility due to the Eighty Years' War against Catholic Spain's rule. Protestantism is mostly a result of Calvinist and Lutheran missionary efforts during the Dutch colonial era.[266][267][268] Although they are the most common branch, there is a multitude of other denominations elsewhere in the country.[269]\n\n\nThere was a small Jewish presence in the archipelago until 1945, mostly Dutch and some Baghdadi Jews. Since most left after Indonesia proclaimed independence, Judaism was never accorded official status, and only a tiny number of Jews remain today, mostly in Jakarta and Surabaya.[270]\n\n\nAt the national and local level, Indonesia's political leadership and civil society groups have played a crucial role in interfaith relations, both positively and negatively. The invocation of the first principle of Indonesia's philosophical foundation, Pancasila[271][272] (i.e. the belief in the one and only God), often serves as a reminder of religious tolerance,[273] though instances of intolerance have occurred.[274][73] An overwhelming majority of Indonesians consider religion to be essential and an integral part of life.[275][276]\n\n\n\n### Education and health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Indonesia and Health in Indonesia\n\n![](image)University of Indonesia is one of Indonesia's top universities\nEducation is compulsory for 12 years.[277] Parents can choose between state-run, non-sectarian schools or private or semi-private religious (usually Islamic) schools, supervised by the ministries of Education and Religion, respectively.[278] Private international schools that do not follow the national curriculum are also available. The enrolment rate is 93% for primary education, 79% for secondary education, and 36% for tertiary education (2018).[279] The literacy rate is 96% (2018), and the government spends about 3.6% of GDP (2015) on education.[279] In 2018, there were 4,670 higher educational institutions in Indonesia, with most (74%) located in Sumatra and Java.[280][281] According to the QS World University Rankings, Indonesia's top universities are the University of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada University and the Bandung Institute of Technology.[282]\n\n\nGovernment expenditure on healthcare was about 3.3% of GDP in 2016.[283] As part of an attempt to achieve universal health care, the government launched the National Health Insurance (*Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional*, JKN) in 2014.[284] It includes coverage for a range of services from the public and also private firms that have opted to join the scheme. Despite remarkable improvements in recent decades, such as rising life expectancy (from 62.3 years in 1990 to 71.7 years in 2019)[285] and declining child mortality (from 84 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990 to 23.9 deaths in 2019),[286] challenges remain, including maternal and child health, low air quality, malnutrition, high rate of smoking, and infectious diseases.[287]\n\n\n\n### Issues[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Human rights in Indonesia, Organised crime in Indonesia, and Papua conflict\n\n![](image)Riots on the streets of Jakarta on 14 May 1998\nIn the economic sphere, there is a gap in wealth, unemployment rate, and health between densely populated islands and economic centres (such as Sumatra and Java) and sparsely populated, disadvantaged areas (such as Maluku and Papua).[288][289] This is created by a situation in which nearly 80% of Indonesia's population lives in the western parts of the archipelago[290] and yet grows slower than the rest of the country.\n\n\nIn the social arena, numerous cases of racism and discrimination, especially against Chinese Indonesians and Papuans, have been well documented throughout Indonesia's history.[291][292] Such cases have sometimes led to violent conflicts, most notably the May 1998 riots and the Papua conflict, which has continued since 1962. LGBT people also regularly face challenges. Although LGBT issues have been relatively obscure, the 2010s (especially after 2016) has seen a rapid surge of anti-LGBT rhetoric, putting LGBT Indonesians into a frequent subject of intimidation, discrimination, and even violence.[293][294] In addition, Indonesia has been reported to have sizeable numbers of child and forced labourers, with the former being prevalent in the palm oil and tobacco industries, while the latter in the fishing industry.[295][296]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Indonesia\n See also: National Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia and Public holidays in Indonesia\n\nThe cultural history of the Indonesian archipelago spans more than two millennia. Influences from the Indian subcontinent, mainland China, the Middle East, Europe,[297][298] Melanesian and Austronesian peoples have historically shaped the cultural, linguistic and religious makeup of the archipelago. As a result, modern-day Indonesia has a multicultural, multilingual and multi-ethnic society,[1][2] with a complex cultural mixture that differs significantly from the original indigenous cultures. Indonesia currently holds twelve items of UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage, including a wayang puppet theatre, kris, batik,[299] pencak silat, angklung, gamelan, and the three genres of traditional Balinese dance.[300]\n\n\n\n### Art and architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indonesian art and Architecture of Indonesia\n\nFurther information: Indonesian painting\n\n![](image)Traditional Balinese painting depicting cockfighting\nIndonesian arts include both age-old art forms developed through centuries and recently developed contemporary art. Despite often displaying local ingenuity, Indonesian arts have absorbed foreign influences—most notably from India, the Arab world, China and Europe, due to contacts and interactions facilitated, and often motivated by trade.[301] Painting is an established and developed art in Bali, where its people are famed for their artistry. Their painting tradition started as classical Kamasan or Wayang style visual narrative, derived from visual art discovered on *candi* bas reliefs in eastern Java.[302]\n\n\n\n![](image)An avenue of Tongkonan houses in a Torajan village, South Sulawesi\nThere have been numerous discoveries of megalithic sculptures in Indonesia.[303] Subsequently, tribal art has flourished within the culture of Nias, Batak, Asmat, Dayak and Toraja.[304][305] Wood and stone are common materials used as the media for sculpting among these tribes. Between the 8th and 15th centuries, the Javanese civilisation developed refined stone sculpting art and architecture influenced by the Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilisation. The temples of Borobudur and Prambanan are among the most famous examples of the practice.[306]\n\n\nAs with the arts, Indonesian architecture has absorbed foreign influences that have brought cultural changes and profound effects on building styles and techniques. The most dominant has traditionally been Indian; however, Chinese, Arab, and European influences have also been significant. Traditional carpentry, masonry, stone and woodwork techniques and decorations have thrived in vernacular architecture, with numbers of traditional houses' (*rumah adat*) styles that have been developed. The traditional houses and settlements vary by ethnic group, and each has a specific custom and history.[307] Examples include Toraja's Tongkonan, Minangkabau's Rumah Gadang and Rangkiang, Javanese style Pendopo pavilion with Joglo style roof, Dayak's longhouses, various Malay houses, Balinese houses and temples, and also different forms of rice barns (*lumbung*).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Music, dance and clothing[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of Indonesia, Dance in Indonesia, and National costume of Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nIndonesian music and dance. **Clockwise from top**: a gamelan player; Angklung; Sundanese Jaipongan Mojang Priangan dance; and Balinese Pendet dance.\n\nThe music of Indonesia predates historical records. Various indigenous tribes incorporate chants and songs accompanied by musical instruments in their rituals. Angklung, kacapi suling, gong, gamelan, talempong, kulintang, and sasando are examples of traditional Indonesian instruments. The diverse world of Indonesian music genres results from the musical creativity of its people and subsequent cultural encounters with foreign influences. These include gambus and qasida from the Middle East,[308] keroncong from Portugal,[309] and dangdut—one of Indonesia's most popular music genres—with notable Hindi influence as well as Malay orchestras.[310] Today, the Indonesian music industry enjoys both nationwide and regional popularity in Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei,[311][312] due to the common culture and mutual intelligibility between Indonesian and Malay.[313]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cotton wikkelrok with batik geometric pattern\nIndonesian dances have a diverse history, with more than 3,000 original dances. Scholars believe that they had their beginning in rituals and religious worship.[314] Examples include war dances, a dance of witch doctors, and a dance to call for rain or any agricultural rituals such as Hudoq. Indonesian dances derive their influences from the archipelago's prehistoric and tribal, Hindu-Buddhist, and Islamic periods. Recently, modern dances and urban teen dances have gained popularity due to the influence of Western culture and those of Japan and South Korea to some extent. However, various traditional dances, including those of Java, Bali and Dayak, remain a living and dynamic tradition.[315]\n\n\nIndonesia has various clothing styles due to its long and rich cultural history. The national costume originates from the country's indigenous culture and traditional textile traditions. The Javanese Batik and Kebaya[316] are arguably Indonesia's most recognised national costumes, though they have Sundanese and Balinese origins as well.[317] Each province has a representation of traditional attire and dress,[297] such as Ulos of Batak from North Sumatra; Songket of Malay and Minangkabau from Sumatra; and Ikat of Sasak from Lombok. People wear national and regional costumes during traditional weddings, formal ceremonies, music performances, government and official occasions,[317] and they vary from traditional to modern attire.\n\n\n\n### Theatre and cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Theatre of Indonesia and Cinema of Indonesia\n\nFurther information: List of highest-grossing films in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Pandava and Krishna in an act of the *Wayang Wong* performance\nWayang, the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese shadow puppet theatre display several mythological legends such as Ramayana and Mahabharata.[318] Other forms of local drama include the Javanese Ludruk and Ketoprak, the Sundanese Sandiwara, Betawi Lenong,[319][320] and various Balinese dance dramas. They incorporate humour and jest and often involve audiences in their performances.[321] Some theatre traditions also include music, dancing and silat martial art, such as Randai from the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra. It is usually performed for traditional ceremonies and festivals[322][323] and based on semi-historical Minangkabau legends and love story.[323] Modern performing art also developed in Indonesia with its distinct style of drama. Notable theatre, dance, and drama troupe such as *Teater Koma* are famous as it often portrays social and political satire of Indonesian society.[324]\n\n\n\n![](image)Advertisement for *Loetoeng Kasaroeng* (1926), the first fiction film produced in the Dutch East Indies\nThe first film produced in the archipelago was *Loetoeng Kasaroeng*,[325] a silent film by Dutch director L. Heuveldorp. The film industry expanded after independence, with six films made in 1949 rising to 58 in 1955. Usmar Ismail, who made significant imprints in the 1950s and 1960s, is generally considered the pioneer of Indonesian films.[326] The latter part of the Sukarno era saw the use of cinema for nationalistic, anti-Western purposes, and foreign films were subsequently banned, while the New Order utilised a censorship code that aimed to maintain social order.[327] Production of films peaked during the 1980s, although it declined significantly in the next decade.[325] Notable films in this period include *Pengabdi Setan* (1980), *Nagabonar* (1987), *Tjoet Nja' Dhien* (1988), *Catatan Si Boy* (1989), and Warkop's comedy films.\n\n\nIndependent film making was a rebirth of the film industry since 1998, when films started addressing previously banned topics, such as religion, race, and love.[327] Between 2000 and 2005, the number of films released each year steadily increased.[328] Riri Riza and Mira Lesmana were among the new generation of filmmakers who co-directed *Kuldesak* (1999), *Petualangan Sherina* (2000), *Ada Apa dengan Cinta?* (2002), and *Laskar Pelangi* (2008). In 2022, *KKN di Desa Penari* smashed box office records, becoming the most-watched Indonesian film with 9.2 million tickets sold.[329] Indonesia has held annual film festivals and awards, including the Indonesian Film Festival (*Festival Film Indonesia*) held intermittently since 1955. It hands out the Citra Award, the film industry's most prestigious award. From 1973 to 1992, the festival was held annually and then discontinued until its revival in 2004.\n\n\n\n### Mass media and literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mass media in Indonesia and Indonesian literature\n\n![](image)Metro TV at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium, reporting the 2010 AFF Championship\nMedia freedom increased considerably after the fall of the New Order, during which the Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media and restricted foreign media.[330] The television market includes several national commercial networks and provincial networks that compete with public TVRI, which held a monopoly on TV broadcasting from 1962 to 1989. By the early 21st century, the improved communications system had brought television signals to every village, and people can choose from up to 11 channels.[331] Private radio stations carry news bulletins while foreign broadcasters supply programmes. The number of printed publications has increased significantly since 1998.[331]\n\n\nLike other developing countries, Indonesia began developing Internet in the early 1990s. Its first commercial Internet service provider, PT. Indo Internet began operation in Jakarta in 1994.[332] The country had 171 million Internet users in 2018, with a penetration rate that keeps increasing annually.[333] Most are between the ages of 15 and 19 and depend primarily on mobile phones for access, outnumbering laptops and computers.[334]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Indonesia's most famous novelist. Many considered him to be Southeast Asia's leading candidate for a Nobel Prize in Literature.[335]\nThe oldest evidence of writing in the Indonesian archipelago is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century. Many of Indonesia's peoples have firmly rooted oral traditions, which help define and preserve their cultural identities.[336] In written poetry and prose, several traditional forms dominate, mainly syair, pantun, gurindam, hikayat and babad. Examples of these forms include *Syair Abdul Muluk*, *Hikayat Hang Tuah*, *Sulalatus Salatin*, and *Babad Tanah Jawi*.[337]\n\n\nEarly modern Indonesian literature originates in the Sumatran tradition.[338][339] Literature and poetry flourished during the decades leading up to and after independence. Balai Pustaka, the government bureau for popular literature, was instituted in 1917 to promote the development of indigenous literature. Many scholars consider the 1950s and 1960s to be the Golden Age of Indonesian Literature.[340] The style and characteristics of modern Indonesian literature vary according to the dynamics of the country's political and social landscape,[340] most notably the war of independence in the second half of the 1940s and the anti-communist mass killings in the mid-1960s.[341] Notable literary figures of the modern era include Hamka, Chairil Anwar, Mohammad Yamin, Merari Siregar, Marah Roesli, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, and Ayu Utami.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indonesian cuisine\n\n![](image)*Nasi Padang* with *rendang*, *gulai* and vegetables\nIndonesian cuisine is one of the world's most diverse, vibrant, and colourful, full of intense flavour.[342] Many regional cuisines exist, often based upon indigenous culture and foreign influences such as Chinese, European, Middle Eastern, and Indian precedents.[343] Rice is the leading staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables. Spices (notably chilli), coconut milk, fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients.[344]\n\n\nSome popular dishes such as *nasi goreng*, *gado-gado*, *sate*, and *soto* are ubiquitous and considered national dishes. The Ministry of Tourism, however, chose *tumpeng* as the official national dish in 2014, describing it as binding the diversity of various culinary traditions.[345] Other popular dishes include *rendang*, one of the many Minangkabau cuisines along with *dendeng* and *gulai*. Another fermented food is *oncom*, similar in some ways to *tempeh* but uses a variety of bases (not only soy), created by different fungi, and is prevalent in West Java.[346]\n\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sport in Indonesia and Indonesian martial arts\n\n![](image)A demonstration of *Pencak Silat*, a form of martial artsBadminton and football are the most popular sports in Indonesia. Indonesia is among the few countries that have won the Thomas and Uber Cup, the world team championship of men's and women's badminton. Along with weightlifting, it is the sport that contributes the most to Indonesia's Olympic medal tally. Liga 1 is the country's premier football club league. On the international stage, Indonesia was the first Asian team to participate in the FIFA World Cup in 1938 as the Dutch East Indies.[347] On a regional level, Indonesia won a bronze medal at the 1958 Asian Games as well as three gold medals at the 1987, 1991 and 2023 Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games). Indonesia's first appearance at the AFC Asian Cup was in 1996 and successfully qualified for a total of five tournaments, although they never make the knockout phase.[348]\n\n\nOther popular sports include boxing and basketball, which has a long history in Indonesia and was part of the first National Games (*Pekan Olahraga Nasional*, PON) in 1948.[349] *Sepak takraw* and *karapan sapi* (bull racing) in Madura are some examples of Indonesia's traditional sports. In areas with a history of tribal warfare, mock fighting contests are held, such as *caci* in Flores and *pasola* in Sumba. *Pencak Silat* is an Indonesian martial art and, in 2018, became one of the sporting events in the Asian Games, with Indonesia appearing as one of the leading competitors. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia is one of the top sports powerhouses by topping the SEA Games medal table ten times since 1977,[350] most recently in 2011.[351]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n* ![icon](image)Islands portal\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n* List of Indonesia-related topics\n* Index of Indonesia-related articles\n* Outline of Indonesia\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** UK: /ˌɪndəˈniːziə, -ʒə/ *IN-də-NEE-zee-ə, -⁠zhə* US: /ˌɪndəˈniːʒə, -ʃə/ ⓘ *IN-də-NEE-zhə, -⁠shə*;[10][11] Indonesian pronunciation: [ɪndoˈnesia]\n2. **^** *Republik Indonesia* ([reˈpublik ɪndoˈnesia] ⓘ) is the most-used official name, though the name Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia (*Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia*, NKRI) also appears in some official documents.\n3. **^** During the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, Indonesia withdrew from the UN due to the latter's election to the United Nations Security Council, although it returned 18 months later.

Economists estimate that Pakistan was part of the wealthiest region of the world throughout the first millennium CE, with the largest economy by GDP. This advantage was lost in the 18th century as other regions such as China and Western Europe edged forward.[298] Pakistan is considered a developing country[299] and is one of the Next Eleven, a group of eleven countries that, along with the BRICs, have a high potential to become the world's largest economies in the 21st century.[300]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2014 Goldman Sachs predicted that Pakistan's economy would grow 15 times in the next 35 years to become the 18th-largest economy in the world by 2050.[321] In his 2016 book, *The Rise and Fall of Nations*, Ruchir Sharma termed Pakistan's economy as at a 'take-off' stage and the future outlook until 2020 has been termed 'Very Good'. Sharma termed it possible to transform Pakistan from a \"low-income to a middle-income country during the next five years\".[322]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Share of world GDP (PPP)[323] |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | Share\n |\n| 1980 | 0.54%\n |\n| 1990 | 0.72%\n |\n| 2000\n | 0.74%\n |\n| 2010\n | 0.79%\n |\n| 2017 | 0.83%\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt is South Asia's second-largest economy, representing about 15.0% of regional GDP.[313]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Fiscal Year | GDP growth[314] | Inflation rate[315] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2013–14 | ![Increase](image)4.05% | ![10](image)8.6%\n |\n| 2014–15 | ![Increase](image)4.06% | ![10](image)4.5%\n |\n| 2015–16 | ![Increase](image)4.56% | ![10](image)2.9%\n |\n| 2016–17 | ![Increase](image)5.37% | ![10](image)4.2%\n |\n| 2017–18\n | ![Increase](image)5.79%\n | ![10](image)3.8%\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Countriesand territories\n | * Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Central African Republic\n* Northern Cyprus1\n* Russia\n* Thailand\n |\n| Muslimcommunities\n | * Moro National Liberation Front\n |\n| Internationalorganizations\n | * Economic Cooperation Organization\n* African Union\n* Arab League\n* Non-Aligned Movement\n* United Nations\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| History | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Declarations | * Abuja Declaration (1989)\n* Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam (1990)\n* OIC Resolution 10/11 (2008)\n* OIC Council of Foreign Ministers Resolution 10/37 (2010)\n |\n\n |\n| Sessions | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Extraordinary | * First\n* Second\n* Third\n* Fourth\n* Fifth\n* Sixth\n* Seventh\n* Eighth\n* Ninth\n* Arab–Islamic (2023)\n |\n\n |\n| Demographics | * Economy\n\t+ GDP\n\t+ GDP per capita\n\t+ Exports\n\t+ Imports\n* Population\n* Largest cities\n* Education\n |\n| * 1 As the \"Turkish Cypriot State\".\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMembers of the Commonwealth of Nations\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states(members) | * Antigua and Barbuda\n* Australia\n* Bahamas\n* Bangladesh\n* Barbados\n* Belize\n* Botswana\n* Brunei\n* Cameroon\n* Canada\n* Cyprus\n* Dominica\n* Eswatini (Swaziland)\n* Fiji\n* Gabon\n* Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Grenada\n* Guyana\n* India\n* Jamaica\n* Kenya\n* Kiribati\n* Lesotho\n* Malawi\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Malta\n* Mauritius\n* Mozambique\n* Namibia\n* Nauru\n* New Zealand\n* Nigeria\n* Pakistan\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Rwanda\n* Saint Kitts and Nevis\n* Saint Lucia\n* Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\n* Samoa\n* Seychelles\n* Sierra Leone\n* Singapore\n* Solomon Islands\n* South Africa\n* Sri Lanka\n* Tanzania\n* Togo\n* Tonga\n* Trinidad and Tobago\n* Tuvalu\n* Uganda\n* United Kingdom\n* Vanuatu\n* Zambia\n |\n| Associated states | * Cook Islands\n* Niue\n |\n| Dependent territories | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n239. **^** Amerasinghe, Terence P.

The majority of the population in the south resides along the Indus River, with Karachi the most populous commercial city.[475] In the east, west, and north, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Sargodha, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan, and Peshawar. During the period 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, more than 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.[476] Immigration, from both within and outside the country, is regarded as one of the main factors contributing to urbanisation in Pakistan. One analysis of the 1998 national census highlighted the significance of the partition of India in the 1940s as it relates to urban change in Pakistan.[477]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Government | Federal Islamic parliamentary republic |\n|  |\n| • President\n | Arif Alvi |\n| • Prime Minister\n | Anwaar ul Haq Kakar (Caretaker) |\n| • Chairman of the Senate\n | Sadiq Sanjrani |\n| • Speaker of the National Assembly\n | Raja Pervaiz Ashraf |\n| • Chief Justice\n | Qazi Faez Isa |\n|  |\n| Legislature | Parliament |\n| • Upper house\n | Senate |\n| • Lower house\n | National Assembly |\n| Independence from the United Kingdom\n |\n|  |\n| • Declaration\n | 23 March 1940 |\n| • Independence\n | 14 August 1947 |\n| • Dominion status terminated\n | 23 March 1956 |\n| • Purchase of Gwadar\n | 8 December 1958 |\n| • Eastern territory withdrawn\n | 16 December 1971 |\n| • Current constitution\n | 14 August 1973 |\n|  |\n| Area  |\n| • Total\n | 881,913 km2 (340,509 sq mi)[b][9] (33rd) |\n| • Water (%)\n | 2.86 |\n| Population |\n| • 2023 census\n | 241,499,431[10] |\n| • Density\n | 273.8/km2 (709.1/sq mi) (56th) |\n| GDP (PPP) | 2023 estimate |\n| • Total\n | ![Increase](image) $1.568 trillion[11] (23rd) |\n| • Per capita\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of 2022[update], Pakistan's estimated nominal GDP is US$376.493 billion.[307] The GDP by PPP is US$1.512 trillion.

Countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have enough influence to not be considered small, but not enough to be major powers. Within the limits of their regions, they play a significant political role. Thus instinctively, they would qualify as middle powers. While it is not the objective here to question the characteristics of Jordan's definition of middle powers, we argue that Pakistan is in fact a middle power despite its being nuclear-armed. When looking at the numbers, for instance, it appears that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan can be classified as middle powers (see in this regard Ping, 2007).\n30. **^** Iqbal, Anwar (8 November 2015). \"Pakistan an emerging market economy: IMF\". *www.dawn.com*.

The country is also the fifth-largest producer of cotton, with cotton production of 14 million bales from a modest beginning of 1.7 million bales in the early 1950s; is self-sufficient in sugarcane; and is the fourth-largest producer in the world of milk. Land and water resources have not risen proportionately, but the increases have taken place mainly due to gains in labour and agriculture productivity. The major breakthrough in crop production took place in the late 1960s and 1970s due to the Green Revolution that made a significant contribution to land and yield increases of wheat and rice. Private tube wells led to a 50 percent increase in the cropping intensity which was augmented by tractor cultivation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n162. **^** \"About Pakistan: Geography\".

Pakistan is the fourth-largest producer of cotton with the third-largest spinning capacity in Asia after China and India, contributing 5% to the global spinning capacity.[339] China is the second largest buyer of Pakistani textiles, importing US$1.527 billion of textiles last fiscal. Unlike the US, where mostly value-added textiles are imported, China buys only cotton yarn and cotton fabric from Pakistan. In 2012, Pakistani textile products accounted for 3.3% or US$1.07bn of all UK textile imports, 12.4% or $4.61bn of total Chinese textile imports, 3.0% of all US textile imports ($2,980 million), 1.6% of total German textile imports ($880 million) and 0.7% of total Indian textile imports ($888 million).[340]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Khan, Feroz Hassan (2012). *Eating grass: the making of the Pakistani bomb*.

From 1947 until the 1970s the train system was the primary means of transport until the nationwide constructions of the national highways and the economic boom of the automotive industry. Beginning in the 1990s there was a marked shift in traffic from rail to highways; dependence grew on roads after the introduction of vehicles in the country. Now the railway's share of inland traffic is below 8% for passengers and 4% for freight traffic.[331] As personal transportation began to be dominated by the automobile, total rail track decreased from 8,775 kilometres (5,453 miles) in 1990–91 to 7,791 kilometres (4,841 miles) in 2011.[374][376] Pakistan expects to use the rail service to boost foreign trade with China, Iran, and Turkey.[377]\n\n\n\n#### Airports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of airports in Pakistan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe private print media, state-owned Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV), and Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) for radio were the dominant media outlets until the beginning of the 21st century.

Under Nasir's leadership the ISI was also involved in supporting Chinese Muslims in Xinjiang Province, rebel Muslim groups in the Philippines, and some religious groups in Central Asia.[287]\n\n\nSince 2004, the military has been engaged in an insurgency in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, mainly against the Tehrik-i-Taliban factions.[288] Major operations undertaken by the army include Operation Black Thunderstorm, Operation Rah-e-Nijat and Operation Zarb-e-Azb.[289]\n\n\nAccording to SIPRI, Pakistan was the 9th-largest recipient and importer of arms between 2012 and 2016.[290]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

The enforcement of Urdu to the exclusion of other majority languages has been criticised; in particular, the expulsion of Pashto from the institutional domains and deprivation of state patronage has been shown to create conditions in which Pashtuns are placed at social, cultural, and economic disadvantage.[456]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n- Jennings, Justin (2016). *Killing Civilization: A Reassessment of Early Urbanism and Its Consequences*.

This level of Sufism involves belief in intercession through saints, veneration of their shrines, and forming bonds (Mureed) with a *pir* (saint). Many rural Pakistani Muslims associate with *pirs* and seek their intercession.[503] The second level of Sufism in Pakistan is 'intellectual Sufism', which is growing among the urban and educated population. They are influenced by the writings of Sufis such as the medieval theologian al-Ghazali, the Sufi reformer Shaykh Aḥmad Sirhindi, and Shah Wali Allah.[504] Contemporary Islamic fundamentalists criticise Sufism's popular character, which in their view does not accurately reflect the teachings and practice of Muhammad and his companions.[505]\n\n\n\n#### Hinduism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hinduism in Pakistan\n\n![](image)Hindu proportion of each Pakistani District in 2017 according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nApart from participating in Pakistan's atomic bomb project, he made major contributions in molecular morphology, physical martensite, and its integrated applications in condensed and material physics.[411]\n\n\nIn 2010 Pakistan was ranked 43rd in the world in terms of published scientific papers.[412] The Pakistan Academy of Sciences, a strong scientific community, plays an influential and vital role in formulating recommendations regarding science policies for the government.[413] Pakistan was ranked 88th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023, up from 107th in 2020.[414][415][416]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nImran Khan (the chairman of PTI) won the 2018 Pakistan general election with 116 general seats and became the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan in election of National Assembly of Pakistan for Prime Minister by getting 176 votes against Shehbaz Sharif (the chairman of PML (N)) who got 96 votes.[125] In April 2022, Shehbaz Sharif was elected as Pakistan's new prime minister, after Imran Khan lost a no-confidence vote in the parliament.[126]\n\n\n\n\n## Role of Islam[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Islam in Pakistan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe court system is organised as a hierarchy, with the Supreme Court at the apex, below which are high courts, Federal Shariat Courts (one in each province and one in the federal capital), district courts (one in each district), Judicial Magistrate Courts (in every town and city), Executive Magistrate Courts, and civil courts. The Penal code has limited jurisdiction in the Tribal Areas, where law is largely derived from tribal customs.[248][251]\n\n\n\n### Kashmir conflict[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kashmir conflict\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA small number of nilgai are found along the Pakistan–India border and in some parts of Cholistan.[173][175] A wide variety of animals live in the mountainous north, including the Marco Polo sheep, the urial (a subspecies of wild sheep), the markhor goat, the ibex goat, the Asian black bear, and the Himalayan brown bear.[173][176][177] Among the rare animals found in the area are the snow leopard[176] and the blind Indus river dolphin, of which there are believed to be about 1,100 remaining, protected at the Indus River Dolphin Reserve in Sindh.[176][178] In total, 174 mammals, 177 reptiles, 22 amphibians, 198 freshwater fish species and 5,000 species of invertebrates (including insects) have been recorded in Pakistan.[170]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPakistan does not have diplomatic relations with Israel;[212] nonetheless, some Israeli citizens have visited the country on tourist visas.[213] However, an exchange took place between the two countries using Turkey as a communication conduit.[214] Despite Pakistan being the only country in the world that has not established diplomatic relations with Armenia, an Armenian community still resides in Pakistan.[215]\n\n\n\n#### Relations with China[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–Pakistan relations\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis constitution is the country's most important document, laying the foundations of the current government.[156] The Pakistani military establishment has played an influential role in mainstream politics throughout Pakistan's political history.[72] The periods 1958–1971, 1977–1988, and 1999–2008 saw military coups that resulted in the imposition of martial law and military commanders who governed as de facto presidents.[181] Today Pakistan has a multi-party parliamentary system with clear division of powers and checks and balances among the branches of government. The first successful democratic transition occurred in May 2013. Politics in Pakistan is centred on, and dominated by, a homegrown social philosophy comprising a blend of ideas from socialism, conservatism, and the third way. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Legislative: The bicameral legislature comprises a 104-member Senate (upper house) and a 342-member National Assembly (lower house). Members of the National Assembly are elected through the first-past-the-post system under universal adult suffrage, representing electoral districts known as National Assembly constituencies. According to the constitution, the 70 seats reserved for women and religious minorities are allocated to the political parties according to their proportional representation. Senate members are elected by provincial legislators, with all the provinces having equal representation.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n58. **^** Paracha, Nadeem F.

In 1971, the exclave of East Pakistan seceded as the new country of Bangladesh after a nine-month-long civil war. In the following four decades, Pakistan has been ruled by governments whose descriptions, although complex, commonly alternated between civilian and military, democratic and authoritarian, relatively secular and Islamist.[22] Pakistan elected a civilian government in 2008, and in 2010 adopted a parliamentary system with periodic elections.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe arrival of Islam in what is today Pakistan meant the sudden end of Buddhist architecture in the area and a smooth transition to the predominantly pictureless Islamic architecture. The most important Indo-Islamic-style building still standing is the tomb of the Shah Rukn-i-Alam in Multan. During the Mughal era, design elements of Persian-Islamic architecture were fused with and often produced playful forms of Hindustani art. Lahore, as the occasional residence of Mughal rulers, contains many important buildings from the empire. Most prominent among them are the Badshahi Mosque, the fortress of Lahore with the famous Alamgiri Gate, the colourful, Mughal-style Wazir Khan Mosque,[553] the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore, and the Shahjahan Mosque in Thatta. In the British colonial period, predominantly functional buildings of the Indo-European representative style developed from a mixture of European and Indian-Islamic components. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Lollywood, Punjabi and Pashto film industry is based in Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar. While Bollywood films were banned from public cinemas from 1965 until 2008, they had remained an important part of popular culture.[526] In 2019, the screening of Bollywood movies was again faced with an indefinite ban.[527] In contrast to the ailing Pakistani film industry, Urdu televised dramas and theatrical performances continue to be popular, as many entertainment media outlets air them regularly.[528] Urdu dramas dominate the television entertainment industry, which has launched critically acclaimed miniseries and featured popular actors and actresses since the 1990s.[529] In the 1960s–1970s, pop music and disco (1970s) dominated the country's music industry. In the 1980s–1990s, British influenced rock music appeared and jolted the country's entertainment industry.[530] In the 2000s, heavy metal music gained popular and critical acclaim.[531]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPakistan's economic growth since its inception has been varied. It has been slow during periods of democratic transition, but robust during the three periods of martial law, although the foundation for sustainable and equitable growth was not formed.[96] The early to middle 2000s was a period of rapid economic reforms; the government raised development spending, which reduced poverty levels by 10% and increased GDP by 3%.[156][316] The economy cooled again from 2007.[156] Inflation reached 25.0% in 2008,[317] and Pakistan had to depend on a fiscal policy backed by the International Monetary Fund to avoid possible bankruptcy.[318] A year later, the Asian Development Bank reported that Pakistan's economic crisis was easing.[319] The inflation rate for the fiscal year 2010–11 was 14.1%.[320] Since 2013, as part of an International Monetary Fund program, Pakistan's economic growth has picked up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Malala Yousafzai at the Women of the World Festival in 2014\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007, the PPP secured the most votes in the elections of 2008, appointing party member Yousaf Raza Gillani as Prime Minister.[119] Threatened with impeachment, President Musharraf resigned on 18 August 2008, and was succeeded by Asif Ali Zardari.[120] Clashes with the judicature prompted Gillani's disqualification from the Parliament and as the Prime Minister in June 2012.[121] By its own financial calculations, Pakistan's involvement in the war on terrorism has cost up to $118 billion,[122] sixty thousand casualties and more than 1.8 million displaced civilians.[123] The general election held in 2013 saw the PML (N) almost achieve a supermajority, following which Nawaz Sharif was elected as the Prime Minister, returning to the post for the third time in fourteen years, in a democratic transition.[124] In 2018, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHinduism is mostly associated with Sindhis, and Pakistan hosts major events such as the Hinglaj Yatra pilgrimage. Hindu temples may be found throughout Sindh, where the dharma features prominently. Many Hindus in Pakistan complain about the prospect of religious violence against them and being treated like second-class citizens, and many have emigrated to India or further abroad.[486]\n\n\nIn addition, some Pakistanis also do not profess any faith (such as atheists and agnostics) in Pakistan. According to the 1998 census, people who did not state their religion accounted for 0.5% of the population.\n\n\n\n#### Islam[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Islam in Pakistan and Sufism in Pakistan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Services[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Real estate in Pakistan, Information technology in Pakistan, and Banking in Pakistan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n381. **^** \"Good news on track: Lahore to get Pakistan's first metro train\". *The Express Tribune*. 23 May 2014.

Sharma termed it possible to transform Pakistan from a \"low-income to a middle-income country during the next five years\".[322]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Share of world GDP (PPP)[323] |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | Share\n |\n| 1980 | 0.54%\n |\n| 1990 | 0.72%\n |\n| 2000\n | 0.74%\n |\n| 2010\n | 0.79%\n |\n| 2017 | 0.83%\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt is South Asia's second-largest economy, representing about 15.0% of regional GDP.[313]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Fiscal Year | GDP growth[314] | Inflation rate[315] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2013–14 | ![Increase](image)4.05% | ![10](image)8.6%\n |\n| 2014–15 | ![Increase](image)4.06% | ![10](image)4.5%\n |\n| 2015–16 | ![Increase](image)4.56% | ![10](image)2.9%\n |\n| 2016–17 | ![Increase](image)5.37% | ![10](image)4.2%\n |\n| 2017–18\n | ![Increase](image)5.79%\n | ![10](image)3.8%\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Countriesand territories\n | * Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Central African Republic\n* Northern Cyprus1\n* Russia\n* Thailand\n |\n| Muslimcommunities\n | * Moro National Liberation Front\n |\n| Internationalorganizations\n | * Economic Cooperation Organization\n* African Union\n* Arab League\n* Non-Aligned Movement\n* United Nations\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| History | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Declarations | * Abuja Declaration (1989)\n* Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam (1990)\n* OIC Resolution 10/11 (2008)\n* OIC Council of Foreign Ministers Resolution 10/37 (2010)\n |\n\n |\n| Sessions | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Extraordinary | * First\n* Second\n* Third\n* Fourth\n* Fifth\n* Sixth\n* Seventh\n* Eighth\n* Ninth\n* Arab–Islamic (2023)\n |\n\n |\n| Demographics | * Economy\n\t+ GDP\n\t+ GDP per capita\n\t+ Exports\n\t+ Imports\n* Population\n* Largest cities\n* Education\n |\n| * 1 As the \"Turkish Cypriot State\".\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMembers of the Commonwealth of Nations\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states(members) | * Antigua and Barbuda\n* Australia\n* Bahamas\n* Bangladesh\n* Barbados\n* Belize\n* Botswana\n* Brunei\n* Cameroon\n* Canada\n* Cyprus\n* Dominica\n* Eswatini (Swaziland)\n* Fiji\n* Gabon\n* Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Grenada\n* Guyana\n* India\n* Jamaica\n* Kenya\n* Kiribati\n* Lesotho\n* Malawi\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Malta\n* Mauritius\n* Mozambique\n* Namibia\n* Nauru\n* New Zealand\n* Nigeria\n* Pakistan\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Rwanda\n* Saint Kitts and Nevis\n* Saint Lucia\n* Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\n* Samoa\n* Seychelles\n* Sierra Leone\n* Singapore\n* Solomon Islands\n* South Africa\n* Sri Lanka\n* Tanzania\n* Togo\n* Tonga\n* Trinidad and Tobago\n* Tuvalu\n* Uganda\n* United Kingdom\n* Vanuatu\n* Zambia\n |\n| Associated states | * Cook Islands\n* Niue\n |\n| Dependent territories | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n239. **^** Amerasinghe, Terence P.

The majority of the population in the south resides along the Indus River, with Karachi the most populous commercial city.[475] In the east, west, and north, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Sargodha, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan, and Peshawar. During the period 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, more than 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.[476] Immigration, from both within and outside the country, is regarded as one of the main factors contributing to urbanisation in Pakistan. One analysis of the 1998 national census highlighted the significance of the partition of India in the 1940s as it relates to urban change in Pakistan.[477]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Government | Federal Islamic parliamentary republic |\n|  |\n| • President\n | Arif Alvi |\n| • Prime Minister\n | Anwaar ul Haq Kakar (Caretaker) |\n| • Chairman of the Senate\n | Sadiq Sanjrani |\n| • Speaker of the National Assembly\n | Raja Pervaiz Ashraf |\n| • Chief Justice\n | Qazi Faez Isa |\n|  |\n| Legislature | Parliament |\n| • Upper house\n | Senate |\n| • Lower house\n | National Assembly |\n| Independence from the United Kingdom\n |\n|  |\n| • Declaration\n | 23 March 1940 |\n| • Independence\n | 14 August 1947 |\n| • Dominion status terminated\n | 23 March 1956 |\n| • Purchase of Gwadar\n | 8 December 1958 |\n| • Eastern territory withdrawn\n | 16 December 1971 |\n| • Current constitution\n | 14 August 1973 |\n|  |\n| Area  |\n| • Total\n | 881,913 km2 (340,509 sq mi)[b][9] (33rd) |\n| • Water (%)\n | 2.86 |\n| Population |\n| • 2023 census\n | 241,499,431[10] |\n| • Density\n | 273.8/km2 (709.1/sq mi) (56th) |\n| GDP (PPP) | 2023 estimate |\n| • Total\n | ![Increase](image) $1.568 trillion[11] (23rd) |\n| • Per capita\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of 2022[update], Pakistan's estimated nominal GDP is US$376.493 billion.[307] The GDP by PPP is US$1.512 trillion.

Countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have enough influence to not be considered small, but not enough to be major powers. Within the limits of their regions, they play a significant political role. Thus instinctively, they would qualify as middle powers. While it is not the objective here to question the characteristics of Jordan's definition of middle powers, we argue that Pakistan is in fact a middle power despite its being nuclear-armed. When looking at the numbers, for instance, it appears that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan can be classified as middle powers (see in this regard Ping, 2007).\n30. **^** Iqbal, Anwar (8 November 2015). \"Pakistan an emerging market economy: IMF\". *www.dawn.com*.

The country is also the fifth-largest producer of cotton, with cotton production of 14 million bales from a modest beginning of 1.7 million bales in the early 1950s; is self-sufficient in sugarcane; and is the fourth-largest producer in the world of milk. Land and water resources have not risen proportionately, but the increases have taken place mainly due to gains in labour and agriculture productivity. The major breakthrough in crop production took place in the late 1960s and 1970s due to the Green Revolution that made a significant contribution to land and yield increases of wheat and rice. Private tube wells led to a 50 percent increase in the cropping intensity which was augmented by tractor cultivation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n162. **^** \"About Pakistan: Geography\".

Pakistan is the fourth-largest producer of cotton with the third-largest spinning capacity in Asia after China and India, contributing 5% to the global spinning capacity.[339] China is the second largest buyer of Pakistani textiles, importing US$1.527 billion of textiles last fiscal. Unlike the US, where mostly value-added textiles are imported, China buys only cotton yarn and cotton fabric from Pakistan. In 2012, Pakistani textile products accounted for 3.3% or US$1.07bn of all UK textile imports, 12.4% or $4.61bn of total Chinese textile imports, 3.0% of all US textile imports ($2,980 million), 1.6% of total German textile imports ($880 million) and 0.7% of total Indian textile imports ($888 million).[340]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Khan, Feroz Hassan (2012). *Eating grass: the making of the Pakistani bomb*.

From 1947 until the 1970s the train system was the primary means of transport until the nationwide constructions of the national highways and the economic boom of the automotive industry. Beginning in the 1990s there was a marked shift in traffic from rail to highways; dependence grew on roads after the introduction of vehicles in the country. Now the railway's share of inland traffic is below 8% for passengers and 4% for freight traffic.[331] As personal transportation began to be dominated by the automobile, total rail track decreased from 8,775 kilometres (5,453 miles) in 1990–91 to 7,791 kilometres (4,841 miles) in 2011.[374][376] Pakistan expects to use the rail service to boost foreign trade with China, Iran, and Turkey.[377]\n\n\n\n#### Airports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of airports in Pakistan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe private print media, state-owned Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV), and Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) for radio were the dominant media outlets until the beginning of the 21st century.

Under Nasir's leadership the ISI was also involved in supporting Chinese Muslims in Xinjiang Province, rebel Muslim groups in the Philippines, and some religious groups in Central Asia.[287]\n\n\nSince 2004, the military has been engaged in an insurgency in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, mainly against the Tehrik-i-Taliban factions.[288] Major operations undertaken by the army include Operation Black Thunderstorm, Operation Rah-e-Nijat and Operation Zarb-e-Azb.[289]\n\n\nAccording to SIPRI, Pakistan was the 9th-largest recipient and importer of arms between 2012 and 2016.[290]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

The enforcement of Urdu to the exclusion of other majority languages has been criticised; in particular, the expulsion of Pashto from the institutional domains and deprivation of state patronage has been shown to create conditions in which Pashtuns are placed at social, cultural, and economic disadvantage.[456]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n- Jennings, Justin (2016). *Killing Civilization: A Reassessment of Early Urbanism and Its Consequences*.

This level of Sufism involves belief in intercession through saints, veneration of their shrines, and forming bonds (Mureed) with a *pir* (saint). Many rural Pakistani Muslims associate with *pirs* and seek their intercession.[503] The second level of Sufism in Pakistan is 'intellectual Sufism', which is growing among the urban and educated population. They are influenced by the writings of Sufis such as the medieval theologian al-Ghazali, the Sufi reformer Shaykh Aḥmad Sirhindi, and Shah Wali Allah.[504] Contemporary Islamic fundamentalists criticise Sufism's popular character, which in their view does not accurately reflect the teachings and practice of Muhammad and his companions.[505]\n\n\n\n#### Hinduism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hinduism in Pakistan\n\n![](image)Hindu proportion of each Pakistani District in 2017 according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nApart from participating in Pakistan's atomic bomb project, he made major contributions in molecular morphology, physical martensite, and its integrated applications in condensed and material physics.[411]\n\n\nIn 2010 Pakistan was ranked 43rd in the world in terms of published scientific papers.[412] The Pakistan Academy of Sciences, a strong scientific community, plays an influential and vital role in formulating recommendations regarding science policies for the government.[413] Pakistan was ranked 88th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023, up from 107th in 2020.[414][415][416]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nImran Khan (the chairman of PTI) won the 2018 Pakistan general election with 116 general seats and became the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan in election of National Assembly of Pakistan for Prime Minister by getting 176 votes against Shehbaz Sharif (the chairman of PML (N)) who got 96 votes.[125] In April 2022, Shehbaz Sharif was elected as Pakistan's new prime minister, after Imran Khan lost a no-confidence vote in the parliament.[126]\n\n\n\n\n## Role of Islam[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Islam in Pakistan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe court system is organised as a hierarchy, with the Supreme Court at the apex, below which are high courts, Federal Shariat Courts (one in each province and one in the federal capital), district courts (one in each district), Judicial Magistrate Courts (in every town and city), Executive Magistrate Courts, and civil courts. The Penal code has limited jurisdiction in the Tribal Areas, where law is largely derived from tribal customs.[248][251]\n\n\n\n### Kashmir conflict[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kashmir conflict\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA small number of nilgai are found along the Pakistan–India border and in some parts of Cholistan.[173][175] A wide variety of animals live in the mountainous north, including the Marco Polo sheep, the urial (a subspecies of wild sheep), the markhor goat, the ibex goat, the Asian black bear, and the Himalayan brown bear.[173][176][177] Among the rare animals found in the area are the snow leopard[176] and the blind Indus river dolphin, of which there are believed to be about 1,100 remaining, protected at the Indus River Dolphin Reserve in Sindh.[176][178] In total, 174 mammals, 177 reptiles, 22 amphibians, 198 freshwater fish species and 5,000 species of invertebrates (including insects) have been recorded in Pakistan.[170]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPakistan does not have diplomatic relations with Israel;[212] nonetheless, some Israeli citizens have visited the country on tourist visas.[213] However, an exchange took place between the two countries using Turkey as a communication conduit.[214] Despite Pakistan being the only country in the world that has not established diplomatic relations with Armenia, an Armenian community still resides in Pakistan.[215]\n\n\n\n#### Relations with China[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–Pakistan relations\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis constitution is the country's most important document, laying the foundations of the current government.[156] The Pakistani military establishment has played an influential role in mainstream politics throughout Pakistan's political history.[72] The periods 1958–1971, 1977–1988, and 1999–2008 saw military coups that resulted in the imposition of martial law and military commanders who governed as de facto presidents.[181] Today Pakistan has a multi-party parliamentary system with clear division of powers and checks and balances among the branches of government. The first successful democratic transition occurred in May 2013. Politics in Pakistan is centred on, and dominated by, a homegrown social philosophy comprising a blend of ideas from socialism, conservatism, and the third way. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Legislative: The bicameral legislature comprises a 104-member Senate (upper house) and a 342-member National Assembly (lower house). Members of the National Assembly are elected through the first-past-the-post system under universal adult suffrage, representing electoral districts known as National Assembly constituencies. According to the constitution, the 70 seats reserved for women and religious minorities are allocated to the political parties according to their proportional representation. Senate members are elected by provincial legislators, with all the provinces having equal representation.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n58. **^** Paracha, Nadeem F.

In 1971, the exclave of East Pakistan seceded as the new country of Bangladesh after a nine-month-long civil war. In the following four decades, Pakistan has been ruled by governments whose descriptions, although complex, commonly alternated between civilian and military, democratic and authoritarian, relatively secular and Islamist.[22] Pakistan elected a civilian government in 2008, and in 2010 adopted a parliamentary system with periodic elections.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe arrival of Islam in what is today Pakistan meant the sudden end of Buddhist architecture in the area and a smooth transition to the predominantly pictureless Islamic architecture. The most important Indo-Islamic-style building still standing is the tomb of the Shah Rukn-i-Alam in Multan. During the Mughal era, design elements of Persian-Islamic architecture were fused with and often produced playful forms of Hindustani art. Lahore, as the occasional residence of Mughal rulers, contains many important buildings from the empire. Most prominent among them are the Badshahi Mosque, the fortress of Lahore with the famous Alamgiri Gate, the colourful, Mughal-style Wazir Khan Mosque,[553] the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore, and the Shahjahan Mosque in Thatta. In the British colonial period, predominantly functional buildings of the Indo-European representative style developed from a mixture of European and Indian-Islamic components. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Lollywood, Punjabi and Pashto film industry is based in Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar. While Bollywood films were banned from public cinemas from 1965 until 2008, they had remained an important part of popular culture.[526] In 2019, the screening of Bollywood movies was again faced with an indefinite ban.[527] In contrast to the ailing Pakistani film industry, Urdu televised dramas and theatrical performances continue to be popular, as many entertainment media outlets air them regularly.[528] Urdu dramas dominate the television entertainment industry, which has launched critically acclaimed miniseries and featured popular actors and actresses since the 1990s.[529] In the 1960s–1970s, pop music and disco (1970s) dominated the country's music industry. In the 1980s–1990s, British influenced rock music appeared and jolted the country's entertainment industry.[530] In the 2000s, heavy metal music gained popular and critical acclaim.[531]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPakistan's economic growth since its inception has been varied. It has been slow during periods of democratic transition, but robust during the three periods of martial law, although the foundation for sustainable and equitable growth was not formed.[96] The early to middle 2000s was a period of rapid economic reforms; the government raised development spending, which reduced poverty levels by 10% and increased GDP by 3%.[156][316] The economy cooled again from 2007.[156] Inflation reached 25.0% in 2008,[317] and Pakistan had to depend on a fiscal policy backed by the International Monetary Fund to avoid possible bankruptcy.[318] A year later, the Asian Development Bank reported that Pakistan's economic crisis was easing.[319] The inflation rate for the fiscal year 2010–11 was 14.1%.[320] Since 2013, as part of an International Monetary Fund program, Pakistan's economic growth has picked up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Malala Yousafzai at the Women of the World Festival in 2014\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007, the PPP secured the most votes in the elections of 2008, appointing party member Yousaf Raza Gillani as Prime Minister.[119] Threatened with impeachment, President Musharraf resigned on 18 August 2008, and was succeeded by Asif Ali Zardari.[120] Clashes with the judicature prompted Gillani's disqualification from the Parliament and as the Prime Minister in June 2012.[121] By its own financial calculations, Pakistan's involvement in the war on terrorism has cost up to $118 billion,[122] sixty thousand casualties and more than 1.8 million displaced civilians.[123] The general election held in 2013 saw the PML (N) almost achieve a supermajority, following which Nawaz Sharif was elected as the Prime Minister, returning to the post for the third time in fourteen years, in a democratic transition.[124] In 2018, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHinduism is mostly associated with Sindhis, and Pakistan hosts major events such as the Hinglaj Yatra pilgrimage. Hindu temples may be found throughout Sindh, where the dharma features prominently. Many Hindus in Pakistan complain about the prospect of religious violence against them and being treated like second-class citizens, and many have emigrated to India or further abroad.[486]\n\n\nIn addition, some Pakistanis also do not profess any faith (such as atheists and agnostics) in Pakistan. According to the 1998 census, people who did not state their religion accounted for 0.5% of the population.\n\n\n\n#### Islam[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Islam in Pakistan and Sufism in Pakistan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Services[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Real estate in Pakistan, Information technology in Pakistan, and Banking in Pakistan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n381. **^** \"Good news on track: Lahore to get Pakistan's first metro train\". *The Express Tribune*. 23 May 2014.

Garlic, ginger, turmeric, red chili, and garam masala are used in most dishes, and home cooking regularly includes curry, *roti*, a thin flatbread made from wheat, is a staple food, usually served with curry, meat, vegetables, and lentils.

This period is marked by prolonged stagflation, instability, corruption, nationalism, geopolitical rivalry with India, and the clash of left wing-right wing ideologies.[113] As PML (N) secured a supermajority in elections in 1997, Nawaz Sharif authorised nuclear testings (See:*Chagai-I* and *Chagai-II*), as a retaliation to the second nuclear tests ordered by India, led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in May 1998.[114]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** David W. del Testa, ed.
