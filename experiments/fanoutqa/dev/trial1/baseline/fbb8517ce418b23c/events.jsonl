With a budget of US$19 million, production of *Spirited Away* began in 2000. Pixar animator John Lasseter, a fan and friend of Miyazaki, convinced Walt Disney Pictures to buy the film's North American distribution rights, and served as executive producer of its English-dubbed version.[10] Lasseter then hired Kirk Wise as director and Donald W. Ernst as producer, while screenwriters Cindy and Donald Hewitt wrote the English-language dialogue to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.[11]\n\n\nOriginally released in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho, the film received universal acclaim,[12] grossing $395.8 million at the worldwide box office.[a][13] Accordingly, it became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history with a total of ¥31.68 billion ($305 million).[14] It held the record for 19 years until it was surpassed by *Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train* in 2020.[15]\n\n\nA co-recipient of the Golden Bear with *Bloody Sunday* at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival and the first, and to date only, hand-drawn and non-English-language animated film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards,[16] *Spirited Away* is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time and has been included in various \"best-of\" lists.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's plot summary **may be too long or excessively detailed.** Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. *(November 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nTen-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home. Her father stops to explore an abandoned amusement park despite Chihiro's protests. They find a restaurant stocked with food, which Chihiro's parents begin to eat. While exploring alone, Chihiro finds a bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to leave. However, Chihiro discovers that her parents have become pigs, and the exit is blocked by an ocean of water.\n\n\nHaku finds Chihiro and leads her toward the bathhouse. She sees several animals and creatures visiting the bathhouse, as well as No-Face (顔無し, *Kaonashi*), a masked spirit. Haku instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a yōkai commanding the susuwatari. Kamaji says that he already has enough susuwatari to help him. After Chihiro tries to help but inadvertently causes some disruption, Kamaji asks a worker named Lin to send Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse.\n\n\nYubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but Chihiro persists. Eventually, Yubaba reveals she took an oath to give work to anyone who asks for it, and gives Chihiro a working contract. Yubaba takes away the second kanji of her name (千尋), renaming her Sen (千). Haku reveals he is also working for Yubaba.\n\n\nThe bathhouse workers dislike Sen, but give her work as Lin's assistant. Later that night, when Yubaba leaves, Haku finds Sen and shows her her parents, who are being held in pigpens. Haku explains that Yubaba controls people by taking their names; if she completely forgets hers like he once did, she will never be able to leave the spirit world. Sen is ostracized by the other workers. While working, she invites No-Face inside, accidentally believing him to be a customer.\n\n\nThe spirit of a polluted river arrives as Sen's first customer. Sen discovers a bicycle handle sticking out of him, and the workers help to remove the bicycle and a large amount of garbage. He gives her a magic emetic dumpling as a token of gratitude. Meanwhile, No-Face imitates the gold left behind by the river spirit and tempts a worker with it before swallowing him. He demands food from the bathhouse and begins giving away extensive amounts of gold to its workers. Meanwhile, Sen sees paper shikigami attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed. When he crashes into Yubaba's penthouse with grievous injuries, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami stows away on her back.\n\n\nNo-Face is given large amounts of food, but soon begins eating more workers. In the penthouse, the stowaway shikigami shapeshifts into Yubaba's sister, Zeniba, who turns Yubaba's son, Boh, into a mouse. Sen, Haku, and Boh fall into the boiler room. Sen feeds Haku part of the emetic dumpling, causing him to vomit up a seal he stole, saving him from its deadly curse. Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba, taking Boh with her. She confronts an engorged No-Face, who reveals he is very lonely. Sen feeds No-Face the rest of the dumpling, and he follows Sen out of the bathhouse, steadily regurgitating everything that he has eaten. Lin takes Sen to the station to see Zeniba, and Sen invites No-Face to follow, despite Lin's protests. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel with train tickets given to Sen by Kamaji. Meanwhile, Yubaba orders that Sen's parents be slaughtered, but Haku reveals that Boh is missing.\n\n\nHaku offers to retrieve Boh if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass a final test. Sen meets with Zeniba, who makes her a magic hairband. Haku appears in dragon form, and Sen, Boh, and Haku leave for the bathhouse, leaving No-Face with Zeniba. Mid-flight, Sen discovers Haku's identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River (ニギハヤミ コハクヌシ, *Nigihayami Kohakunushi*). When they arrive, Sen passes Yubaba's test to identify her parents, and she is allowed to leave. Haku vows to see her again, but she leaves the city with her parents, who do not remember anything after the restaurant. After returning to their own world, the family find their car covered with leaves and dust, as the forest around it has become immensely overgrown. They then exit the forest and continue their journey to their new home.\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character name\n | Voice actor\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese (Nihongo)\n | Japanese\n | English\n |\n| Chihiro Ogino / Sen\n | *Ogino Chihiro* (荻野 千尋) / *Sen* (千)[b] | Rumi Hiiragi | Daveigh Chase |\n| Haku / Spirit of the Kohaku River\n | *Haku* (ハク) / *Nigihayami Kohakunushi* (饒速水小白主)[c] | Miyu Irino | Jason Marsden |\n| Yubaba\n | *Yubāba* (湯婆婆)[d] | Mari Natsuki | Suzanne Pleshette |\n| Zeniba\n | *Zeniiba* (銭婆)[e] |\n| Kamaji\n | *Kamajii* (釜爺)[f] | Bunta Sugawara | David Ogden Stiers |\n| Lin\n | *Rin* (リン) | Yoomi Tamai | Susan Egan |\n| Chichiyaku\n | *Chichiyaku* (父役)\n | Tsunehiko Kamijō | Paul Eiding |\n| Aniyaku (assistant Manager)\n | Aniyaku (兄役)\n | Takehiko Ono | John Ratzenberger |\n| No-Face[g] | *Kaonashi* (顔無し)[g] | Akio Nakamura | Bob Bergen |\n| Aogaeru\n | *Aogaeru* (青蛙)[h] | Tatsuya Gashūin |\n| Bandai-gaeru (foreman)\n | *Bandai-gaeru* (番台蛙)[i] | Yō Ōizumi | Rodger Bumpass |\n| Boh (baby)\n | *Bō* (坊)\n | Ryunosuke Kamiki | Tara Strong |\n| Akio Ogino (Chihiro's father)\n | *Ogino Akio* (荻野 明夫)\n | Takashi Naitō | Michael Chiklis |\n| Yūko Ogino (Chihiro's mother)\n | *Ogino Yūko* (荻野 悠子)\n | Yasuko Sawaguchi | Lauren Holly |\n| River Spirit\n | *Kawa no Kami* (河の神)\n | Koba Hayashi | Jim Ward |\n| Radish Spirit\n | *Oshira-sama* (お白様)[j] | Ken Yasuda | Jack Angel |\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development and inspiration[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"I created a heroine who is an ordinary girl, someone with whom the audience can sympathize [...]. [I]t's not a story in which the characters grow up, but a story in which they draw on something already inside them, brought out by the particular circumstances [...]. I want my young friends to live like that, and I think they, too, have such a wish.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Hayao Miyazaki[17]\n\nEvery summer, Hayao Miyazaki spent his vacation at a mountain cabin with his family and five girls who were friends of the family. The idea for *Spirited Away* came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films for small children and teenagers such as *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Kiki's Delivery Service*, but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read shōjo manga magazines like *Nakayoshi* and *Ribon* the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on \"crushes\" and romance. When looking at his young friends, Miyazaki felt this was not what they \"held dear in their hearts\" and decided to produce the film about a young heroine whom they could look up to instead.[17]\n\n\n\n![Close up photograph of Hayao Miyazaki, smiling and wearing a suit and tie in front of a gold-colored mosaic.](image)Hayao Miyazaki used shōjo manga magazines for inspiration to direct *Spirited Away*.\nMiyazaki had wanted to produce a new film for years, but his two previous proposals—one based on the Japanese book *Kiri no Mukō no Fushigi na Machi* (霧のむこうのふしぎな町) by Sachiko Kashiwaba, and another about a teenage heroine—were rejected. His third proposal, which ended up becoming *Spirited Away*, was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki's hometown. He thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, and there was a small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bath house. Miyazaki was always curious about what was behind it, and he made up several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of *Spirited Away*.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Japanese dragon ascends toward the heavens with Mount Fuji in the background in this print from Ogata Gekkō. *Spirited Away* is heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore.[8]\nProduction of *Spirited Away* commenced in February 2000 on a budget of ¥1.9 billion (US$15 million).[2] Walt Disney Pictures financed ten percent of the film's production cost for the right of first refusal for American distribution.[18][19] As with *Princess Mononoke*, Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli staff experimented with computer animation. With the use of more computers and programs such as Softimage 3D, the staff learned the software, but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story, instead of \"stealing the show\". Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see they were getting it just right.[2] The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production began, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the \"eye candy\" in the film because he wanted it to be simple. Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a \"pretty girl\". At the beginning, he was frustrated at how she looked \"dull\" and thought, \"She isn't cute. Isn't there something we can do?\" As the film neared the end, however, he was relieved to feel \"she will be a charming woman.\"[17]\n\n\n\n![A medium shot photograph of a hot spring in the city of Matsuyama on the island of Shikoku, Japan.](image)Dōgo Onsen\n![A wide photograph of a hallway from the Takahashi Korekiyo residence in the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum, which was one of Miyazaki's inspirations in creating the spirit world's buildings.](image)The Takahashi Korekiyo residence in the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum was one of Miyazaki's inspirations in creating the spirit world's buildings.Miyazaki based some of the buildings in the spirit world on the buildings in the real-life Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan. He often visited the museum for inspiration while working on the film. Miyazaki had always been interested in the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the Meiji period that were available there. The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, \"especially when I stand here alone in the evening, near closing time, and the sun is setting – tears well up in my eyes.\"[17] Another major inspiration was the Notoya Ryokan (能登谷旅館), a traditional Japanese inn located in Yamagata Prefecture, famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features.[20] While some guidebooks and articles claim that the old gold town of Jiufen in Taiwan served as an inspirational model for the film, Miyazaki has denied this.[21] The Dōgo Onsen is also often said to be a key inspiration for the *Spirited Away* onsen/bathhouse.[22]\n\n\nToshio Suzuki, the producer of the film, also cites European inspirations and influences in the production of *Spirited Away*. He specifically invokes the structure of the film as European-inspired due to Miyazaki's own influences by European films such as *The Snow Queen* and *The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep*.[23]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of *Spirited Away*\n\nThe film score of *Spirited Away* was composed and conducted by Miyazaki's regular collaborator Joe Hisaishi, and performed by the New Japan Philharmonic.[24] The soundtrack received awards at the 56th Mainichi Film Competition Award for Best Music, the Tokyo International Anime Fair 2001 Best Music Award in the Theater Movie category, and the 17th Japan Gold Disk Award for Animation Album of the Year.[25][26][27] Later, Hisaishi added lyrics to \"One Summer's Day\" and named the new version of the song \"The Name of Life\" (いのちの名前, *\"Inochi no Namae\"*) which was performed by Ayaka Hirahara.[28]\n\n\nThe closing song, \"Always With Me\" (いつも何度でも, *\"Itsumo Nando Demo\"*, lit. 'Always, No Matter How Many Times') was written and performed by Youmi Kimura, a composer and lyre-player from Osaka.[29] The lyrics were written by Kimura's friend Wakako Kaku. The song was intended to be used for *Rin the Chimney Painter* (煙突描きのリン, *Entotsu-kaki no Rin*), a different Miyazaki film which was never released.[29] In the special features of the Japanese DVD, Hayao Miyazaki explains how the song in fact inspired him to create *Spirited Away*.[29] The song itself would be recognized as Gold at the 43rd Japan Record Awards.[30]\n\n\nBesides the original soundtrack, there is also an image album, titled *Spirited Away Image Album* (千と千尋の神隠し　イメージアルバム, *Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi Imēji Arubamu*), that contains 10 tracks.[31]\n\n\n\n### English dub[edit]\n\n\nJohn Lasseter, Pixar animator and a fan and friend of Miyazaki, would often sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki's work when encountering story problems. After seeing *Spirited Away* Lasseter was ecstatic.[32] Upon hearing his reaction to the film, Disney CEO Michael Eisner asked Lasseter if he would be interested in introducing *Spirited Away* to an American audience. Lasseter obliged by agreeing to serve as the executive producer for the English adaptation. Following this, several others began to join the project: *Beauty and the Beast* co-director Kirk Wise and *Aladdin* co-producer Donald W. Ernst joined Lasseter as director and producer of *Spirited Away*, respectively.[32] Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English-language dialogue, which they wrote in order to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.[11]\n\n\nThe cast of the film consists of Daveigh Chase, Jason Marsden, Suzanne Pleshette (in her final film role before her death in January 2008), Michael Chiklis, Lauren Holly, Susan Egan, David Ogden Stiers and John Ratzenberger (a Pixar regular). Advertising was limited, with *Spirited Away* being mentioned in a small scrolling section of the film section of *Disney.com*; Disney had sidelined their official website for *Spirited Away*[32] and given the film a comparatively small promotional budget.[19] Marc Hairston argues that this was a justified response to Studio Ghibli's retention of the merchandising rights to the film and characters, which limited Disney's ability to properly market the film.[19]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n### Supernaturalism[edit]\n\n\nThe major themes of *Spirited Away*, heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore, centre on the protagonist, Chihiro, and her liminal journey through the realm of spirits. The central location of the film is a Japanese bathhouse where a great variety of Japanese folklore creatures, including kami, come to bathe. Miyazaki cites the solstice rituals when villagers call forth their local kami and invite them into their baths.[8] Chihiro also encounters kami of animals and plants. Miyazaki says of this:\n\n\n> In my grandparents' time, it was believed that kami existed everywhere – in trees, rivers, insects, wells, anything. My generation does not believe this, but I like the idea that we should all treasure everything because spirits might exist there, and we should treasure everything because there is a kind of life to everything.[8]\n> \n> \n\nChihiro's archetypal entrance into another world demarcates her status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The use of the word *kamikakushi* (literally 'hidden by gods') within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this liminal passage: \"Kamikakushi is a verdict of 'social death' in this world, and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant 'social resurrection.'\"[33]\n\n\nAdditional themes are expressed through No-Face, who reflects the characters who surround him, learning by example and taking the traits of whomever he consumes. This nature results in No-Face's monstrous rampage through the bathhouse. After Chihiro saves No-Face with the emetic dumpling, he becomes timid once more. At the end of the film, Zeniba decides to take care of No-Face so he can develop without the negative influence of the bathhouse.[34]\n\n\n\n#### Fantasy[edit]\n\n\nThe film has been compared to Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* and *Through the Looking Glass*, as the stories have some elements in common such as being set in a fantasy world, the plots including a disturbance in logic and stability, and there being motifs such as food having metamorphic qualities; though developments and themes are not shared.[35][36][37] Among other stories compared to *Spirited Away*, *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz* is seen to be more closely linked thematically.[36]\n\n\nYubaba has many similarities to the Coachman from the 1940 film *Pinocchio*, in the sense that she mutates humans into pigs in a similar way that the boys of Pleasure Island were mutated into donkeys. Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's true name symbolically kills the child,[38] who must then assume adulthood. She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.[38]\n\n\n\n### Traditional Japanese culture[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* contains critical commentary on modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues.[39] Chihiro has been seen as a representation of the *shōjo*, whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post-war Japan.[39] Just as Chihiro seeks her past identity, Japan, in its anxiety over the economic downturn occurring during the release of the film in 2001, sought to reconnect to past values.[38] In an interview, Miyazaki has commented on this nostalgic element for an old Japan.[40]\n\n\nJapanese philosophy plays a huge role in *Spirited Away*, specifically through concepts like *Kami* and principles like *Mottainai* and *On*.[41] The concept of Kami, for instance, involves various spirits that each represent different elements and aspects of nature. The principle of Mottainai, which is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, embodies a sense of regret towards waste, valuing the complete utilization of an object or resource. While the principle of On, a key tenet of Japanese ethics that signifies a sense of moral indebtedness, plays a significant role in Chihiro's character development.\n\n\n\n### Western consumerism[edit]\n\n\nSimilar to the Japanese concept of *On*, the film can be partly understood as an exploration of the effect of greediness and Western consumerism on traditional Japanese culture.[42] For instance, Yubaba is stylistically unique within the bathhouse, wearing a Western dress and living among European décor and furnishings, in contrast with the minimalist Japanese style of her employees' quarters, representing the Western capitalist influence over Japan in its Meiji period and beyond. Along with its function within the ostensible coming of age theme, Yubaba's act of taking Chihiro's name and replacing it with Sen (an alternate reading of *chi*, the first character in Chihiro's name, lit. 'one thousand') can be thought of as symbolic of capitalism's single-minded concern with value.[39]\n\n\n\nMiyazaki's film setting encapsulates his commentary on modern Japanese values and the erosion of cultural heritage. The bathhouse, situated within an abandoned theme park, symbolizes Japan's distorted cultural identity. This once-traditional locale is marred by neon signs and Westernization, exemplifying cultural degradation. Early scenes highlight economic concerns and consumerism. The film's visuals underscore the commercialization of Japanese culture. The failed theme park serves as a metaphor for the unsuccessful fusion of ideologies. The Meiji design of the park is the setting for Chihiro's parents' metamorphosis – the family arrives in an imported Audi car and the father wears a European-styled polo shirt, reassuring Chihiro that he has \"credit cards and cash\", before morphing into literal consumerist pigs because of their bad habits.[43] Miyazaki has stated:\n\n\n> Chihiro's parents turning into pigs symbolizes how some humans become greedy. At the very moment Chihiro says there is something odd about this town, her parents turn into pigs. There were people that \"turned into pigs\" during Japan's bubble economy (consumer society) of the 1980s, and these people still haven't realized they've become pigs. Once someone becomes a pig, they don't return to being human but instead gradually start to have the \"body and soul of a pig\". These people are the ones saying, \"We are in a recession and don't have enough to eat.\" This doesn't just apply to the fantasy world. Perhaps this isn't a coincidence and the food is actually (an analogy for) \"a trap to catch lost humans\".[42]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe bathhouse of the spirits cannot be seen as a place free of ambiguity and darkness.[44] Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present;[39] it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of No-Face.[45] In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constantly chaotic carnival in the background.[39]\n\n\n\n### Environmentalism[edit]\n\n\nCommentators have often referred to environmental themes in the films of Miyazaki. In *Spirited Away*, two major instances of allusions to environmental issues have been noted. Pam Coats, for example, a Vice President of Walt Disney Feature Animation, describes Chihiro dealing with the \"stink spirit\", who, it turns out, is actually a river spirit but is so corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go.[46]\n\n\nThe second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of humans' need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but do not think about how it can affect other living things.[47][48]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Box office and theatrical release[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* was released theatrically in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho. It grossed a record ¥1.6 billion ($13.1 million) in its first three days, beating the previous record set by *Princess Mononoke*.[49] It was number one at the Japanese box office for its first eleven weeks and spent 16 weeks there in total.[50] After 22 weeks of release and after grossing $224 million in Japan, it started its international release, opening in Hong Kong on 13 December 2001.[51] It was the first film that had grossed more than $200 million at the worldwide box office excluding the United States.[52][53] It went on to gross ¥30.4 billion to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, according to the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan.[54] It also set the all-time attendance record in Japan, surpassing the 16.8 million tickets sold by *Titanic*.[55] Its gross at the Japanese box office has since increased to ¥31.68 billion, as of 2020[update].[56][57]\n\n\nIn February 2002, Wild Bunch, an international sales company that had recently spun off from its former parent StudioCanal, picked up the international sale rights for the film outside of Asia and France.[58] The company would then on-sell it to independent distributors across the world. On 13 April 2002, The Walt Disney Company acquired the Taiwanese, Singapore, Hong Kong, French and North American sale rights to the film, alongside Japanese Home Media rights.[59]\n\n\nDisney's English dub of the film, supervised by Lasseter, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2002[60] and was later released in the United States on 20 September 2002. The film grossed $450,000 in its opening weekend from 26 theatres. *Spirited Away* had very little marketing, less than Disney's other B-films, with a maximum of 151 theatres showing the film in 2002.[19] After the 2003 Oscars,[61] it expanded to 714 theatres. It ultimately grossed around $10 million by September 2003.[62] Outside of Japan and the United States, the movie was moderately successful in both South Korea and France where it grossed $11 million and $6 million, respectively.[63] In Argentina, it is in the top 10 anime films with the most tickets sold.[64]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, then-independent based film distributor Optimum Releasing acquired the rights to the movie from Wild Bunch in January 2003.[65] The company then released it theatrically on 12 September 2003.[66][67] The movie grossed $244,437 on its opening weekend from 51 theatres, and by the end of its theatrical run in October, the movie has grossed $1,383,023 in the country.[68]\n\n\nAbout 18 years after its original release in Japan, *Spirited Away* had a theatrical release in China on 21 June 2019. It follows the theatrical China release of *My Neighbour Totoro* in December 2018.[69] The delayed theatrical release in China was due to long-standing political tensions between China and Japan, but many Chinese became familiar with Miyazaki's films due to rampant video piracy.[70] It topped the Chinese box office with a $28.8-million opening weekend, beating *Toy Story 4* in China.[71] In its second weekend, *Spirited Away* grossed a cumulative $54.8 million in China, and was second only behind *Spider-Man: Far From Home* that weekend.[72] As of 16 July 2019[update], the film has grossed $70 million in China,[73] bringing its worldwide total box office to over $346 million as of 8 July 2019[update].[74]\n\n\n*Spirited Away*'s worldwide box office total stands at US$395,802,070.[a]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* was first released on VHS and DVD formats in Japan by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on 19 July 2002.[75] The Japanese DVD releases include storyboards for the film and the special edition includes a Ghibli DVD player.[76] *Spirited Away* sold 5.5 million home video units in Japan by 2007,[77] and holds the record for most home video copies sold of all-time in the country as of 2014[update].[78] The movie was released on Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Japan on 14 July 2014, and DVD was also reissued on the same day with a new HD master, alongside several other Studio Ghibli movies.[79][80]\n\n\nIn North America, the film was released on DVD and VHS formats by Walt Disney Home Entertainment on 15 April 2003.[81] The attention brought by the Oscar win resulted in the film becoming a strong seller.[82] The bonus features include Japanese trailers, a making-of documentary which originally aired on Nippon Television, interviews with the North American voice actors, a select storyboard-to-scene comparison and *The Art of Spirited Away*, a documentary narrated by actor Jason Marsden.[83] The movie was released on Blu-ray by and North America by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on 16 June 2015.[84] GKIDS and Shout! Factory re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on 17 October 2017 following the expiration of Disney's previous deal with Studio Ghibli in the country in North America.[85] On 12 November 2019, GKIDS and Shout! Factory issued a North-America-exclusive *Spirited Away* collector's edition, which includes the film on Blu-ray, and the film's soundtrack on CD, as well as a 40-page book with statements by Toshio Suzuki and Hayao Miyazaki, and essays by film critic Kenneth Turan and film historian Leonard Maltin.[86][87] Along with the rest of the Studio Ghibli films, *Spirited Away* was released on digital markets in the United States for the first time, on 17 December 2019.\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was released on DVD and VHS as a rental release through independent distributor High Fliers Films PLC following the film's limited theatrical release. It was later officially released on DVD in the UK on 29 March 2004, with the distribution being done by Optimum Releasing themselves.[88] In 2006, the DVD was reissued as a single-disc release (without the second one) with packaging matching other releases in Optimum's \"The Studio Ghibli Collection\" range.[89] The then-renamed StudioCanal UK released the movie on Blu-ray on 24 November 2014, A British 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition, similar to other Studio Ghibli anniversary editions released in the UK, was released on 25 October 2021.[90]\n\n\nIn the United States, the 2015 Blu-ray release grossed $9,925,660 from 557,613 physical units sold as of 21 February 2021[update].[91] In the United Kingdom, the film's Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared several times on the annual lists of best-selling foreign language film on home video, ranking number six in 2015,[92] number five in 2016,[93] and number one in 2019.[94]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nThe film was aired on Nippon TV (NTV) in Japan, on 24 January 2003. It became NTV's most-watched film of all time with a 46.9% audience rating, surpassing the 35.1% record previously set by *Princess Mononoke* in 1999.[95]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was watched by 670,000 viewers on BBC2 in 2010. This made it the year's most-watched foreign-language film on BBC, and the year's second highest foreign film on UK television (below the Indian Bollywood film *Om Shanti Om*).[96] *Spirited Away* was later watched by 300,000 UK viewers on BBC2 in 2011, making it the year's most-watched foreign-language film on BBC2.[97] Combined, the film drew a 970,000 UK television viewership on BBC2 between 2010 and 2011.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* received widespread acclaim. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 96% approval rating based on 221 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"*Spirited Away* is a dazzling, enchanting, and gorgeously drawn fairy tale that will leave viewers a little more curious and fascinated by the world around them.\"[98] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 96 out of 100 based on 41 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[12]\n\n\nRoger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film a full four stars, praising the work and Miyazaki's direction. Ebert also said that *Spirited Away* was one of \"the year's best films\", as well as adding it to his \"Great Movies\" list.[99] Elvis Mitchell of *The New York Times* positively reviewed the film and praised the animation. Mitchell drew a favorable comparison to Lewis Carroll's *Through the Looking-Glass*, and wrote that Miyazaki's \"movies are as much about moodiness as mood\" and that \"the prospect of animated figures' not being what they seem – either spiritually or physically – heightens the tension.\"[37] Derek Elley of *Variety* said that *Spirited Away* \"can be enjoyed by sprigs and adults alike\" and praised the animation and music.[100] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* praised Miyazaki's direction and the voice acting, as well as saying that the film is the \"product of a fierce and fearless imagination whose creations are unlike anything a person has seen before.\"[101] *Orlando Sentinel*'s critic Jay Boyar also praised Miyazaki's direction and said the film is \"the perfect choice for a child who has moved into a new home.\"[102]\n\n\nIn 2004, *Cinefantastique* listed the film as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\".[103] In 2005, *Spirited Away* was ranked by IGN as the 12th-best animated film of all time.[104] The film is also ranked number 9 of the highest-rated movies of all time on Metacritic, being the highest rated traditionally animated film on the site. The film ranked number 10 in *Empire* magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.[105] In 2010, Rotten Tomatoes ranked it as the 13th-best animated film on the site,[106] and in 2012, as the 17th.[107] In 2019, the site considered the film to be #1 among 140 essential animated movies to watch.[108] The film was ranked at number 46 on *Time Out* magazine's list of \"The 100 Best Movies of All Time\".[109] The film is listed within the top ten on the British Film Institute's list of \"Top 50 films for children up to the age of 14\".[110] In 2016, it was voted the fourth-best film of the 21st century by the BBC, as picked by 177 film critics from around the world, making it the highest-ranking animated film on the list.[111] In 2017, *The New York Times* ranked it as the second best film of the 21st Century so far.[112] In 2021, the Writers Guild of America ranked *Spirited Away'*s screenplay the 67th greatest of the 21st century so far.[113] In 2022, the film was ranked number 75 on *Sight & Sound*'s greatest films list, being one of two animated films to make the list (alongside Miyazaki's own *My Neighbor Totoro*).[114][115]\n\n\nIn his book *Otaku*, Hiroki Azuma observed: \"Between 2001 and 2007, the otaku forms and markets quite rapidly won social recognition in Japan,\" and cites Miyazaki's win at the Academy Awards for *Spirited Away* among his examples.[116]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | Animation Kobe | Theatrical Film Award | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Blue Ribbon Awards | Best Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| 5th Japan Media Arts Festival | Grand Prize\n | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Mainichi Film Awards | Best Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Best Animated Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Best Director | Hayao Miyazaki | Won\n |\n| 2002\n | 25th Japan Academy Award | Best Film | *Spirited Away* | Won[117] |\n| Best Song\n | Youmi Kimura | Won[117] |\n| 52nd Berlin International Film Festival | Golden Bear | *Spirited Away* | Won[k][118] |\n| Cinekid Festival | Cinekid Film Award\n | *Spirited Away* | Won[l][119] |\n| 21st Hong Kong Film Awards | Best Asian Film\n | *Spirited Away* | Won[120] |\n| Tokyo Anime Award | Animation of the Year\n | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Best Art Direction\n | Yôji Takeshige [ja] | Won\n |\n| Best Character Design\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Best Director\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Best Music\n | Joe Hisaishi | Won\n |\n| Best Screenplay\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Best Voice Actor\n | Rumi Hiiragi as Chihiro\n | Won\n |\n| Notable Entry\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| National Board of Review | National Board of Review Award for Best Animated Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| New York Film Critics Online | Best Animated Feature\n | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| 2003\n | 75th Academy Awards | Best Animated Feature | *Spirited Away* | Won[121] |\n| 30th Annie Awards | Annie Award for Best Animated Feature | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Directing in an Animated Feature Production | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Annie Award for Writing in a Feature Production | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Annie Award for Music in a Feature Production | Joe Hisaishi\n | Won\n |\n| 8th Critics' Choice Awards | Best Animated Feature | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| 29th Saturn Awards | Best Animated Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Saturn Award for Best Writing | Hayao MiyazakiCindy Davis Hewitt (English adaptation)Donald H.

In another article detailing Hayao Miyazaki's wide impact to the film industry, he wrote \"The influence of *Spirited Away* can be easily observed in Disney productions like *Brave* and *Frozen*, thanks to John Lasseter's (the Chief Creative Officer of Pixar) efforts to introduce it to Western audiences\".[126][127] *Vice* also declared *Spirited Away* to be the all-time best animated film and wrote that the film \"showed how breathtaking, heartfelt, and serious animation can be\" that \"Pixar, Disney, and other mainstream animators have still failed to genuinely realize 15 years later\".[128]\n\n\nFilm director Steven Spielberg said that *Spirited Away* might be \"better than any Disney films\" he has ever seen.[129] Rayna Denison, professor of film, television, and media studies, told *Time* that \"This is a film made by a master animator at the height of his powers and it is one where the quality of the animation really does set it apart from everything else around it. Nobody else was making films that looked like this or that were as inventive as this was at this time\".[130] The film has been cited as influence for various Disney and Pixar animated films. Production designer Harley Jessup said that he initially looked at *Spirited Away* and was inspired by the spiritual feelings elements to utilize them in *Coco*.[131] Co-writers Ken and Ryan Firpo cited the film as one of the influences that helps them explore \"ideas of morality and humanity\" in *Eternals*.[132] *Turning Red*'s director Domee Shi named *Spirited Away* as one of her favorite animated films and one of the influences for her film.[133]\n\n\n\n### Commercial and cultural significance[edit]\n\n\nAccording to *Time*, *Spirited Away* \"arrived at a time when animation was widely perceived as a genre solely for children, and when cultural differences often became barriers to the global distribution of animated works\" but it \"shattered preconceived notions about the art form and also proved that, as a film created in Japanese with elements of Japanese folklore central to its core, it could resonate deeply with audiences around the world\". Denison emphasized that John Lasseter and Disney \"boosted *Spirited Away*'s visibility in America by heavily campaigning for the film to be considered for the Academy Awards\", and cited it as one of the reasons why it won Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[134] Writer Jonathan Clements, whose published works revolve around East Asian culture, anime, and Japanese television dramas, emphasized that the film's Oscar win was \"a wake-up call for a lot of people in the film business who had been disregarding Japanese animation for years\".[135] Susan Napier, professor of Japanese studies at Tufts University, called *Spirited Away*'s wins at major Western award shows \"a very big shot in the arm to the Japanese animation industry\". She further explained that cartoons in the West have often been seen as \"childish, vulgar, things that you didn't take seriously\" but after the film took home the Academy Award, people were starting to see animation as \"a real art form\".[136]\n\n\n\n### Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nA stage adaptation of *Spirited Away* was announced in February 2021 with a world premiere planned in Tokyo on 28 February 2022. It is written and directed by John Caird, with Toho as the production company, with Studio Ghibli's blessing. The role of Chihiro is played by both Kanna Hashimoto and Mone Kamishiraishi.[137][138] In August 2023, it was announced that the production would have its European premiere at the London Coliseum from April 2024.[139]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Main Cast\n |\n| --- |\n| Character name\n | Actor (Double Cast)\n |\n| *Chihiro* (千尋)\n | Kanna Hashimoto | Mone Kamishiraishi |\n| *Haku* (ハク)\n | Kotarou Daigo\n | Hiroki Miura |\n| *Kaonashi* (顔無し)\n | Koharu Sugawara | Tomohiko Tsujimoto\n |\n| *Rin* (リン)\n | Miyu Sakihi\n | Fuu Hinami\n |\n| *Kamajī* (釜爺)\n | Tomorowo Taguchi | Satoshi Hashimoto |\n| *Yubāba* (湯婆婆) / *Zenība* (銭婆)\n | Mari Natsuki | Romi Park |\n\n\n### Limited time re-release[edit]\n\n\nOn a limited time release from 11 November to 18 December in 2022,[140][141] the Imperial Theater performance of the play was available for rental in Japan in several streaming services such as Abema, Amazon Prime Video Japan, Docomo Anime Store, FOD, Hulu Japan and U-Next.[142]\n\n\nThere were 2 versions of the play available for rental:\n\n\n\n* **Stage \"Spirited Away\" (Chihiro role: Kanna Hashimoto) ≪Imperial Theater performance version≫ (First distribution)**.

With a budget of US$19 million, production of *Spirited Away* began in 2000. Pixar animator John Lasseter, a fan and friend of Miyazaki, convinced Walt Disney Pictures to buy the film's North American distribution rights, and served as executive producer of its English-dubbed version.[10] Lasseter then hired Kirk Wise as director and Donald W. Ernst as producer, while screenwriters Cindy and Donald Hewitt wrote the English-language dialogue to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.[11]\n\n\nOriginally released in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho, the film received universal acclaim,[12] grossing $395.8 million at the worldwide box office.[a][13] Accordingly, it became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history with a total of ¥31.68 billion ($305 million).[14] It held the record for 19 years until it was surpassed by *Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train* in 2020.[15]\n\n\nA co-recipient of the Golden Bear with *Bloody Sunday* at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival and the first, and to date only, hand-drawn and non-English-language animated film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards,[16] *Spirited Away* is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time and has been included in various \"best-of\" lists.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's plot summary **may be too long or excessively detailed.** Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. *(November 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nTen-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home. Her father stops to explore an abandoned amusement park despite Chihiro's protests. They find a restaurant stocked with food, which Chihiro's parents begin to eat. While exploring alone, Chihiro finds a bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to leave. However, Chihiro discovers that her parents have become pigs, and the exit is blocked by an ocean of water.\n\n\nHaku finds Chihiro and leads her toward the bathhouse. She sees several animals and creatures visiting the bathhouse, as well as No-Face (顔無し, *Kaonashi*), a masked spirit. Haku instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a yōkai commanding the susuwatari. Kamaji says that he already has enough susuwatari to help him. After Chihiro tries to help but inadvertently causes some disruption, Kamaji asks a worker named Lin to send Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse.\n\n\nYubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but Chihiro persists. Eventually, Yubaba reveals she took an oath to give work to anyone who asks for it, and gives Chihiro a working contract. Yubaba takes away the second kanji of her name (千尋), renaming her Sen (千). Haku reveals he is also working for Yubaba.\n\n\nThe bathhouse workers dislike Sen, but give her work as Lin's assistant. Later that night, when Yubaba leaves, Haku finds Sen and shows her her parents, who are being held in pigpens. Haku explains that Yubaba controls people by taking their names; if she completely forgets hers like he once did, she will never be able to leave the spirit world. Sen is ostracized by the other workers. While working, she invites No-Face inside, accidentally believing him to be a customer.\n\n\nThe spirit of a polluted river arrives as Sen's first customer. Sen discovers a bicycle handle sticking out of him, and the workers help to remove the bicycle and a large amount of garbage. He gives her a magic emetic dumpling as a token of gratitude. Meanwhile, No-Face imitates the gold left behind by the river spirit and tempts a worker with it before swallowing him. He demands food from the bathhouse and begins giving away extensive amounts of gold to its workers. Meanwhile, Sen sees paper shikigami attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed. When he crashes into Yubaba's penthouse with grievous injuries, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami stows away on her back.\n\n\nNo-Face is given large amounts of food, but soon begins eating more workers. In the penthouse, the stowaway shikigami shapeshifts into Yubaba's sister, Zeniba, who turns Yubaba's son, Boh, into a mouse. Sen, Haku, and Boh fall into the boiler room. Sen feeds Haku part of the emetic dumpling, causing him to vomit up a seal he stole, saving him from its deadly curse. Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba, taking Boh with her. She confronts an engorged No-Face, who reveals he is very lonely. Sen feeds No-Face the rest of the dumpling, and he follows Sen out of the bathhouse, steadily regurgitating everything that he has eaten. Lin takes Sen to the station to see Zeniba, and Sen invites No-Face to follow, despite Lin's protests. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel with train tickets given to Sen by Kamaji. Meanwhile, Yubaba orders that Sen's parents be slaughtered, but Haku reveals that Boh is missing.\n\n\nHaku offers to retrieve Boh if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass a final test. Sen meets with Zeniba, who makes her a magic hairband. Haku appears in dragon form, and Sen, Boh, and Haku leave for the bathhouse, leaving No-Face with Zeniba. Mid-flight, Sen discovers Haku's identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River (ニギハヤミ コハクヌシ, *Nigihayami Kohakunushi*). When they arrive, Sen passes Yubaba's test to identify her parents, and she is allowed to leave. Haku vows to see her again, but she leaves the city with her parents, who do not remember anything after the restaurant. After returning to their own world, the family find their car covered with leaves and dust, as the forest around it has become immensely overgrown. They then exit the forest and continue their journey to their new home.\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character name\n | Voice actor\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese (Nihongo)\n | Japanese\n | English\n |\n| Chihiro Ogino / Sen\n | *Ogino Chihiro* (荻野 千尋) / *Sen* (千)[b] | Rumi Hiiragi | Daveigh Chase |\n| Haku / Spirit of the Kohaku River\n | *Haku* (ハク) / *Nigihayami Kohakunushi* (饒速水小白主)[c] | Miyu Irino | Jason Marsden |\n| Yubaba\n | *Yubāba* (湯婆婆)[d] | Mari Natsuki | Suzanne Pleshette |\n| Zeniba\n | *Zeniiba* (銭婆)[e] |\n| Kamaji\n | *Kamajii* (釜爺)[f] | Bunta Sugawara | David Ogden Stiers |\n| Lin\n | *Rin* (リン) | Yoomi Tamai | Susan Egan |\n| Chichiyaku\n | *Chichiyaku* (父役)\n | Tsunehiko Kamijō | Paul Eiding |\n| Aniyaku (assistant Manager)\n | Aniyaku (兄役)\n | Takehiko Ono | John Ratzenberger |\n| No-Face[g] | *Kaonashi* (顔無し)[g] | Akio Nakamura | Bob Bergen |\n| Aogaeru\n | *Aogaeru* (青蛙)[h] | Tatsuya Gashūin |\n| Bandai-gaeru (foreman)\n | *Bandai-gaeru* (番台蛙)[i] | Yō Ōizumi | Rodger Bumpass |\n| Boh (baby)\n | *Bō* (坊)\n | Ryunosuke Kamiki | Tara Strong |\n| Akio Ogino (Chihiro's father)\n | *Ogino Akio* (荻野 明夫)\n | Takashi Naitō | Michael Chiklis |\n| Yūko Ogino (Chihiro's mother)\n | *Ogino Yūko* (荻野 悠子)\n | Yasuko Sawaguchi | Lauren Holly |\n| River Spirit\n | *Kawa no Kami* (河の神)\n | Koba Hayashi | Jim Ward |\n| Radish Spirit\n | *Oshira-sama* (お白様)[j] | Ken Yasuda | Jack Angel |\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development and inspiration[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"I created a heroine who is an ordinary girl, someone with whom the audience can sympathize [...]. [I]t's not a story in which the characters grow up, but a story in which they draw on something already inside them, brought out by the particular circumstances [...]. I want my young friends to live like that, and I think they, too, have such a wish.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Hayao Miyazaki[17]\n\nEvery summer, Hayao Miyazaki spent his vacation at a mountain cabin with his family and five girls who were friends of the family. The idea for *Spirited Away* came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films for small children and teenagers such as *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Kiki's Delivery Service*, but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read shōjo manga magazines like *Nakayoshi* and *Ribon* the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on \"crushes\" and romance. When looking at his young friends, Miyazaki felt this was not what they \"held dear in their hearts\" and decided to produce the film about a young heroine whom they could look up to instead.[17]\n\n\n\n![Close up photograph of Hayao Miyazaki, smiling and wearing a suit and tie in front of a gold-colored mosaic.](image)Hayao Miyazaki used shōjo manga magazines for inspiration to direct *Spirited Away*.\nMiyazaki had wanted to produce a new film for years, but his two previous proposals—one based on the Japanese book *Kiri no Mukō no Fushigi na Machi* (霧のむこうのふしぎな町) by Sachiko Kashiwaba, and another about a teenage heroine—were rejected. His third proposal, which ended up becoming *Spirited Away*, was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki's hometown. He thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, and there was a small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bath house. Miyazaki was always curious about what was behind it, and he made up several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of *Spirited Away*.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Japanese dragon ascends toward the heavens with Mount Fuji in the background in this print from Ogata Gekkō. *Spirited Away* is heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore.[8]\nProduction of *Spirited Away* commenced in February 2000 on a budget of ¥1.9 billion (US$15 million).[2] Walt Disney Pictures financed ten percent of the film's production cost for the right of first refusal for American distribution.[18][19] As with *Princess Mononoke*, Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli staff experimented with computer animation. With the use of more computers and programs such as Softimage 3D, the staff learned the software, but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story, instead of \"stealing the show\". Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see they were getting it just right.[2] The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production began, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the \"eye candy\" in the film because he wanted it to be simple. Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a \"pretty girl\". At the beginning, he was frustrated at how she looked \"dull\" and thought, \"She isn't cute. Isn't there something we can do?\" As the film neared the end, however, he was relieved to feel \"she will be a charming woman.\"[17]\n\n\n\n![A medium shot photograph of a hot spring in the city of Matsuyama on the island of Shikoku, Japan.](image)Dōgo Onsen\n![A wide photograph of a hallway from the Takahashi Korekiyo residence in the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum, which was one of Miyazaki's inspirations in creating the spirit world's buildings.](image)The Takahashi Korekiyo residence in the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum was one of Miyazaki's inspirations in creating the spirit world's buildings.Miyazaki based some of the buildings in the spirit world on the buildings in the real-life Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan. He often visited the museum for inspiration while working on the film. Miyazaki had always been interested in the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the Meiji period that were available there. The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, \"especially when I stand here alone in the evening, near closing time, and the sun is setting – tears well up in my eyes.\"[17] Another major inspiration was the Notoya Ryokan (能登谷旅館), a traditional Japanese inn located in Yamagata Prefecture, famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features.[20] While some guidebooks and articles claim that the old gold town of Jiufen in Taiwan served as an inspirational model for the film, Miyazaki has denied this.[21] The Dōgo Onsen is also often said to be a key inspiration for the *Spirited Away* onsen/bathhouse.[22]\n\n\nToshio Suzuki, the producer of the film, also cites European inspirations and influences in the production of *Spirited Away*. He specifically invokes the structure of the film as European-inspired due to Miyazaki's own influences by European films such as *The Snow Queen* and *The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep*.[23]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of *Spirited Away*\n\nThe film score of *Spirited Away* was composed and conducted by Miyazaki's regular collaborator Joe Hisaishi, and performed by the New Japan Philharmonic.[24] The soundtrack received awards at the 56th Mainichi Film Competition Award for Best Music, the Tokyo International Anime Fair 2001 Best Music Award in the Theater Movie category, and the 17th Japan Gold Disk Award for Animation Album of the Year.[25][26][27] Later, Hisaishi added lyrics to \"One Summer's Day\" and named the new version of the song \"The Name of Life\" (いのちの名前, *\"Inochi no Namae\"*) which was performed by Ayaka Hirahara.[28]\n\n\nThe closing song, \"Always With Me\" (いつも何度でも, *\"Itsumo Nando Demo\"*, lit. 'Always, No Matter How Many Times') was written and performed by Youmi Kimura, a composer and lyre-player from Osaka.[29] The lyrics were written by Kimura's friend Wakako Kaku. The song was intended to be used for *Rin the Chimney Painter* (煙突描きのリン, *Entotsu-kaki no Rin*), a different Miyazaki film which was never released.[29] In the special features of the Japanese DVD, Hayao Miyazaki explains how the song in fact inspired him to create *Spirited Away*.[29] The song itself would be recognized as Gold at the 43rd Japan Record Awards.[30]\n\n\nBesides the original soundtrack, there is also an image album, titled *Spirited Away Image Album* (千と千尋の神隠し　イメージアルバム, *Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi Imēji Arubamu*), that contains 10 tracks.[31]\n\n\n\n### English dub[edit]\n\n\nJohn Lasseter, Pixar animator and a fan and friend of Miyazaki, would often sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki's work when encountering story problems. After seeing *Spirited Away* Lasseter was ecstatic.[32] Upon hearing his reaction to the film, Disney CEO Michael Eisner asked Lasseter if he would be interested in introducing *Spirited Away* to an American audience. Lasseter obliged by agreeing to serve as the executive producer for the English adaptation. Following this, several others began to join the project: *Beauty and the Beast* co-director Kirk Wise and *Aladdin* co-producer Donald W. Ernst joined Lasseter as director and producer of *Spirited Away*, respectively.[32] Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English-language dialogue, which they wrote in order to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.[11]\n\n\nThe cast of the film consists of Daveigh Chase, Jason Marsden, Suzanne Pleshette (in her final film role before her death in January 2008), Michael Chiklis, Lauren Holly, Susan Egan, David Ogden Stiers and John Ratzenberger (a Pixar regular). Advertising was limited, with *Spirited Away* being mentioned in a small scrolling section of the film section of *Disney.com*; Disney had sidelined their official website for *Spirited Away*[32] and given the film a comparatively small promotional budget.[19] Marc Hairston argues that this was a justified response to Studio Ghibli's retention of the merchandising rights to the film and characters, which limited Disney's ability to properly market the film.[19]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n### Supernaturalism[edit]\n\n\nThe major themes of *Spirited Away*, heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore, centre on the protagonist, Chihiro, and her liminal journey through the realm of spirits. The central location of the film is a Japanese bathhouse where a great variety of Japanese folklore creatures, including kami, come to bathe. Miyazaki cites the solstice rituals when villagers call forth their local kami and invite them into their baths.[8] Chihiro also encounters kami of animals and plants. Miyazaki says of this:\n\n\n> In my grandparents' time, it was believed that kami existed everywhere – in trees, rivers, insects, wells, anything. My generation does not believe this, but I like the idea that we should all treasure everything because spirits might exist there, and we should treasure everything because there is a kind of life to everything.[8]\n> \n> \n\nChihiro's archetypal entrance into another world demarcates her status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The use of the word *kamikakushi* (literally 'hidden by gods') within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this liminal passage: \"Kamikakushi is a verdict of 'social death' in this world, and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant 'social resurrection.'\"[33]\n\n\nAdditional themes are expressed through No-Face, who reflects the characters who surround him, learning by example and taking the traits of whomever he consumes. This nature results in No-Face's monstrous rampage through the bathhouse. After Chihiro saves No-Face with the emetic dumpling, he becomes timid once more. At the end of the film, Zeniba decides to take care of No-Face so he can develop without the negative influence of the bathhouse.[34]\n\n\n\n#### Fantasy[edit]\n\n\nThe film has been compared to Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* and *Through the Looking Glass*, as the stories have some elements in common such as being set in a fantasy world, the plots including a disturbance in logic and stability, and there being motifs such as food having metamorphic qualities; though developments and themes are not shared.[35][36][37] Among other stories compared to *Spirited Away*, *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz* is seen to be more closely linked thematically.[36]\n\n\nYubaba has many similarities to the Coachman from the 1940 film *Pinocchio*, in the sense that she mutates humans into pigs in a similar way that the boys of Pleasure Island were mutated into donkeys. Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's true name symbolically kills the child,[38] who must then assume adulthood. She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.[38]\n\n\n\n### Traditional Japanese culture[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* contains critical commentary on modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues.[39] Chihiro has been seen as a representation of the *shōjo*, whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post-war Japan.[39] Just as Chihiro seeks her past identity, Japan, in its anxiety over the economic downturn occurring during the release of the film in 2001, sought to reconnect to past values.[38] In an interview, Miyazaki has commented on this nostalgic element for an old Japan.[40]\n\n\nJapanese philosophy plays a huge role in *Spirited Away*, specifically through concepts like *Kami* and principles like *Mottainai* and *On*.[41] The concept of Kami, for instance, involves various spirits that each represent different elements and aspects of nature. The principle of Mottainai, which is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, embodies a sense of regret towards waste, valuing the complete utilization of an object or resource. While the principle of On, a key tenet of Japanese ethics that signifies a sense of moral indebtedness, plays a significant role in Chihiro's character development.\n\n\n\n### Western consumerism[edit]\n\n\nSimilar to the Japanese concept of *On*, the film can be partly understood as an exploration of the effect of greediness and Western consumerism on traditional Japanese culture.[42] For instance, Yubaba is stylistically unique within the bathhouse, wearing a Western dress and living among European décor and furnishings, in contrast with the minimalist Japanese style of her employees' quarters, representing the Western capitalist influence over Japan in its Meiji period and beyond. Along with its function within the ostensible coming of age theme, Yubaba's act of taking Chihiro's name and replacing it with Sen (an alternate reading of *chi*, the first character in Chihiro's name, lit. 'one thousand') can be thought of as symbolic of capitalism's single-minded concern with value.[39]\n\n\n\nMiyazaki's film setting encapsulates his commentary on modern Japanese values and the erosion of cultural heritage. The bathhouse, situated within an abandoned theme park, symbolizes Japan's distorted cultural identity. This once-traditional locale is marred by neon signs and Westernization, exemplifying cultural degradation. Early scenes highlight economic concerns and consumerism. The film's visuals underscore the commercialization of Japanese culture. The failed theme park serves as a metaphor for the unsuccessful fusion of ideologies. The Meiji design of the park is the setting for Chihiro's parents' metamorphosis – the family arrives in an imported Audi car and the father wears a European-styled polo shirt, reassuring Chihiro that he has \"credit cards and cash\", before morphing into literal consumerist pigs because of their bad habits.[43] Miyazaki has stated:\n\n\n> Chihiro's parents turning into pigs symbolizes how some humans become greedy. At the very moment Chihiro says there is something odd about this town, her parents turn into pigs. There were people that \"turned into pigs\" during Japan's bubble economy (consumer society) of the 1980s, and these people still haven't realized they've become pigs. Once someone becomes a pig, they don't return to being human but instead gradually start to have the \"body and soul of a pig\". These people are the ones saying, \"We are in a recession and don't have enough to eat.\" This doesn't just apply to the fantasy world. Perhaps this isn't a coincidence and the food is actually (an analogy for) \"a trap to catch lost humans\".[42]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe bathhouse of the spirits cannot be seen as a place free of ambiguity and darkness.[44] Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present;[39] it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of No-Face.[45] In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constantly chaotic carnival in the background.[39]\n\n\n\n### Environmentalism[edit]\n\n\nCommentators have often referred to environmental themes in the films of Miyazaki. In *Spirited Away*, two major instances of allusions to environmental issues have been noted. Pam Coats, for example, a Vice President of Walt Disney Feature Animation, describes Chihiro dealing with the \"stink spirit\", who, it turns out, is actually a river spirit but is so corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go.[46]\n\n\nThe second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of humans' need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but do not think about how it can affect other living things.[47][48]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Box office and theatrical release[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* was released theatrically in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho. It grossed a record ¥1.6 billion ($13.1 million) in its first three days, beating the previous record set by *Princess Mononoke*.[49] It was number one at the Japanese box office for its first eleven weeks and spent 16 weeks there in total.[50] After 22 weeks of release and after grossing $224 million in Japan, it started its international release, opening in Hong Kong on 13 December 2001.[51] It was the first film that had grossed more than $200 million at the worldwide box office excluding the United States.[52][53] It went on to gross ¥30.4 billion to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, according to the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan.[54] It also set the all-time attendance record in Japan, surpassing the 16.8 million tickets sold by *Titanic*.[55] Its gross at the Japanese box office has since increased to ¥31.68 billion, as of 2020[update].[56][57]\n\n\nIn February 2002, Wild Bunch, an international sales company that had recently spun off from its former parent StudioCanal, picked up the international sale rights for the film outside of Asia and France.[58] The company would then on-sell it to independent distributors across the world. On 13 April 2002, The Walt Disney Company acquired the Taiwanese, Singapore, Hong Kong, French and North American sale rights to the film, alongside Japanese Home Media rights.[59]\n\n\nDisney's English dub of the film, supervised by Lasseter, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2002[60] and was later released in the United States on 20 September 2002. The film grossed $450,000 in its opening weekend from 26 theatres. *Spirited Away* had very little marketing, less than Disney's other B-films, with a maximum of 151 theatres showing the film in 2002.[19] After the 2003 Oscars,[61] it expanded to 714 theatres. It ultimately grossed around $10 million by September 2003.[62] Outside of Japan and the United States, the movie was moderately successful in both South Korea and France where it grossed $11 million and $6 million, respectively.[63] In Argentina, it is in the top 10 anime films with the most tickets sold.[64]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, then-independent based film distributor Optimum Releasing acquired the rights to the movie from Wild Bunch in January 2003.[65] The company then released it theatrically on 12 September 2003.[66][67] The movie grossed $244,437 on its opening weekend from 51 theatres, and by the end of its theatrical run in October, the movie has grossed $1,383,023 in the country.[68]\n\n\nAbout 18 years after its original release in Japan, *Spirited Away* had a theatrical release in China on 21 June 2019. It follows the theatrical China release of *My Neighbour Totoro* in December 2018.[69] The delayed theatrical release in China was due to long-standing political tensions between China and Japan, but many Chinese became familiar with Miyazaki's films due to rampant video piracy.[70] It topped the Chinese box office with a $28.8-million opening weekend, beating *Toy Story 4* in China.[71] In its second weekend, *Spirited Away* grossed a cumulative $54.8 million in China, and was second only behind *Spider-Man: Far From Home* that weekend.[72] As of 16 July 2019[update], the film has grossed $70 million in China,[73] bringing its worldwide total box office to over $346 million as of 8 July 2019[update].[74]\n\n\n*Spirited Away*'s worldwide box office total stands at US$395,802,070.[a]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* was first released on VHS and DVD formats in Japan by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on 19 July 2002.[75] The Japanese DVD releases include storyboards for the film and the special edition includes a Ghibli DVD player.[76] *Spirited Away* sold 5.5 million home video units in Japan by 2007,[77] and holds the record for most home video copies sold of all-time in the country as of 2014[update].[78] The movie was released on Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Japan on 14 July 2014, and DVD was also reissued on the same day with a new HD master, alongside several other Studio Ghibli movies.[79][80]\n\n\nIn North America, the film was released on DVD and VHS formats by Walt Disney Home Entertainment on 15 April 2003.[81] The attention brought by the Oscar win resulted in the film becoming a strong seller.[82] The bonus features include Japanese trailers, a making-of documentary which originally aired on Nippon Television, interviews with the North American voice actors, a select storyboard-to-scene comparison and *The Art of Spirited Away*, a documentary narrated by actor Jason Marsden.[83] The movie was released on Blu-ray by and North America by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on 16 June 2015.[84] GKIDS and Shout! Factory re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on 17 October 2017 following the expiration of Disney's previous deal with Studio Ghibli in the country in North America.[85] On 12 November 2019, GKIDS and Shout! Factory issued a North-America-exclusive *Spirited Away* collector's edition, which includes the film on Blu-ray, and the film's soundtrack on CD, as well as a 40-page book with statements by Toshio Suzuki and Hayao Miyazaki, and essays by film critic Kenneth Turan and film historian Leonard Maltin.[86][87] Along with the rest of the Studio Ghibli films, *Spirited Away* was released on digital markets in the United States for the first time, on 17 December 2019.\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was released on DVD and VHS as a rental release through independent distributor High Fliers Films PLC following the film's limited theatrical release.

Ebert also said that *Spirited Away* was one of \"the year's best films\", as well as adding it to his \"Great Movies\" list.[99] Elvis Mitchell of *The New York Times* positively reviewed the film and praised the animation. Mitchell drew a favorable comparison to Lewis Carroll's *Through the Looking-Glass*, and wrote that Miyazaki's \"movies are as much about moodiness as mood\" and that \"the prospect of animated figures' not being what they seem – either spiritually or physically – heightens the tension.\"[37] Derek Elley of *Variety* said that *Spirited Away* \"can be enjoyed by sprigs and adults alike\" and praised the animation and music.[100] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* praised Miyazaki's direction and the voice acting, as well as saying that the film is the \"product of a fierce and fearless imagination whose creations are unlike anything a person has seen before.\"[101] *Orlando Sentinel*'s critic Jay Boyar also praised Miyazaki's direction and said the film is \"the perfect choice for a child who has moved into a new home.\"[102]\n\n\nIn 2004, *Cinefantastique* listed the film as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\".[103] In 2005, *Spirited Away* was ranked by IGN as the 12th-best animated film of all time.[104] The film is also ranked number 9 of the highest-rated movies of all time on Metacritic, being the highest rated traditionally animated film on the site. The film ranked number 10 in *Empire* magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.[105] In 2010, Rotten Tomatoes ranked it as the 13th-best animated film on the site,[106] and in 2012, as the 17th.[107] In 2019, the site considered the film to be #1 among 140 essential animated movies to watch.[108] The film was ranked at number 46 on *Time Out* magazine's list of \"The 100 Best Movies of All Time\".[109] The film is listed within the top ten on the British Film Institute's list of \"Top 50 films for children up to the age of 14\".[110] In 2016, it was voted the fourth-best film of the 21st century by the BBC, as picked by 177 film critics from around the world, making it the highest-ranking animated film on the list.[111] In 2017, *The New York Times* ranked it as the second best film of the 21st Century so far.[112] In 2021, the Writers Guild of America ranked *Spirited Away'*s screenplay the 67th greatest of the 21st century so far.[113] In 2022, the film was ranked number 75 on *Sight & Sound*'s greatest films list, being one of two animated films to make the list (alongside Miyazaki's own *My Neighbor Totoro*).[114][115]\n\n\nIn his book *Otaku*, Hiroki Azuma observed: \"Between 2001 and 2007, the otaku forms and markets quite rapidly won social recognition in Japan,\" and cites Miyazaki's win at the Academy Awards for *Spirited Away* among his examples.[116]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | Animation Kobe | Theatrical Film Award | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Blue Ribbon Awards | Best Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| 5th Japan Media Arts Festival | Grand Prize\n | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Mainichi Film Awards | Best Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Best Animated Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Best Director | Hayao Miyazaki | Won\n |\n| 2002\n | 25th Japan Academy Award | Best Film | *Spirited Away* | Won[117] |\n| Best Song\n | Youmi Kimura | Won[117] |\n| 52nd Berlin International Film Festival | Golden Bear | *Spirited Away* | Won[k][118] |\n| Cinekid Festival | Cinekid Film Award\n | *Spirited Away* | Won[l][119] |\n| 21st Hong Kong Film Awards | Best Asian Film\n | *Spirited Away* | Won[120] |\n| Tokyo Anime Award | Animation of the Year\n | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Best Art Direction\n | Yôji Takeshige [ja] | Won\n |\n| Best Character Design\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Best Director\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Best Music\n | Joe Hisaishi | Won\n |\n| Best Screenplay\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Best Voice Actor\n | Rumi Hiiragi as Chihiro\n | Won\n |\n| Notable Entry\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| National Board of Review | National Board of Review Award for Best Animated Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| New York Film Critics Online | Best Animated Feature\n | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| 2003\n | 75th Academy Awards | Best Animated Feature | *Spirited Away* | Won[121] |\n| 30th Annie Awards | Annie Award for Best Animated Feature | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Directing in an Animated Feature Production | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Annie Award for Writing in a Feature Production | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Annie Award for Music in a Feature Production | Joe Hisaishi\n | Won\n |\n| 8th Critics' Choice Awards | Best Animated Feature | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| 29th Saturn Awards | Best Animated Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Saturn Award for Best Writing | Hayao MiyazakiCindy Davis Hewitt (English adaptation)Donald H.

In another article detailing Hayao Miyazaki's wide impact to the film industry, he wrote \"The influence of *Spirited Away* can be easily observed in Disney productions like *Brave* and *Frozen*, thanks to John Lasseter's (the Chief Creative Officer of Pixar) efforts to introduce it to Western audiences\".[126][127] *Vice* also declared *Spirited Away* to be the all-time best animated film and wrote that the film \"showed how breathtaking, heartfelt, and serious animation can be\" that \"Pixar, Disney, and other mainstream animators have still failed to genuinely realize 15 years later\".[128]\n\n\nFilm director Steven Spielberg said that *Spirited Away* might be \"better than any Disney films\" he has ever seen.[129] Rayna Denison, professor of film, television, and media studies, told *Time* that \"This is a film made by a master animator at the height of his powers and it is one where the quality of the animation really does set it apart from everything else around it. Nobody else was making films that looked like this or that were as inventive as this was at this time\".[130] The film has been cited as influence for various Disney and Pixar animated films. Production designer Harley Jessup said that he initially looked at *Spirited Away* and was inspired by the spiritual feelings elements to utilize them in *Coco*.[131] Co-writers Ken and Ryan Firpo cited the film as one of the influences that helps them explore \"ideas of morality and humanity\" in *Eternals*.[132] *Turning Red*'s director Domee Shi named *Spirited Away* as one of her favorite animated films and one of the influences for her film.[133]\n\n\n\n### Commercial and cultural significance[edit]\n\n\nAccording to *Time*, *Spirited Away* \"arrived at a time when animation was widely perceived as a genre solely for children, and when cultural differences often became barriers to the global distribution of animated works\" but it \"shattered preconceived notions about the art form and also proved that, as a film created in Japanese with elements of Japanese folklore central to its core, it could resonate deeply with audiences around the world\". Denison emphasized that John Lasseter and Disney \"boosted *Spirited Away*'s visibility in America by heavily campaigning for the film to be considered for the Academy Awards\", and cited it as one of the reasons why it won Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[134] Writer Jonathan Clements, whose published works revolve around East Asian culture, anime, and Japanese television dramas, emphasized that the film's Oscar win was \"a wake-up call for a lot of people in the film business who had been disregarding Japanese animation for years\".[135] Susan Napier, professor of Japanese studies at Tufts University, called *Spirited Away*'s wins at major Western award shows \"a very big shot in the arm to the Japanese animation industry\". She further explained that cartoons in the West have often been seen as \"childish, vulgar, things that you didn't take seriously\" but after the film took home the Academy Award, people were starting to see animation as \"a real art form\".[136]\n\n\n\n### Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nA stage adaptation of *Spirited Away* was announced in February 2021 with a world premiere planned in Tokyo on 28 February 2022. It is written and directed by John Caird, with Toho as the production company, with Studio Ghibli's blessing. The role of Chihiro is played by both Kanna Hashimoto and Mone Kamishiraishi.[137][138] In August 2023, it was announced that the production would have its European premiere at the London Coliseum from April 2024.[139]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Main Cast\n |\n| --- |\n| Character name\n | Actor (Double Cast)\n |\n| *Chihiro* (千尋)\n | Kanna Hashimoto | Mone Kamishiraishi |\n| *Haku* (ハク)\n | Kotarou Daigo\n | Hiroki Miura |\n| *Kaonashi* (顔無し)\n | Koharu Sugawara | Tomohiko Tsujimoto\n |\n| *Rin* (リン)\n | Miyu Sakihi\n | Fuu Hinami\n |\n| *Kamajī* (釜爺)\n | Tomorowo Taguchi | Satoshi Hashimoto |\n| *Yubāba* (湯婆婆) / *Zenība* (銭婆)\n | Mari Natsuki | Romi Park |\n\n\n### Limited time re-release[edit]\n\n\nOn a limited time release from 11 November to 18 December in 2022,[140][141] the Imperial Theater performance of the play was available for rental in Japan in several streaming services such as Abema, Amazon Prime Video Japan, Docomo Anime Store, FOD, Hulu Japan and U-Next.[142]\n\n\nThere were 2 versions of the play available for rental:\n\n\n\n* **Stage \"Spirited Away\" (Chihiro role: Kanna Hashimoto) ≪Imperial Theater performance version≫ (First distribution)**.

It is based on the 1967 semi-autobiographical short story of the same name by Akiyuki Nosaka.\n\n\nThe film stars Tsutomu Tatsumi, Ayano Shiraishi [ja], Yoshiko Shinohara [ja] and Akemi Yamaguchi [ja]. Set in the city of Kobe, Japan in June 1945, it tells the story of two siblings and war orphans, Seita and Setsuko, and their desperate struggle to survive during the final months of the Second World War. Universally acclaimed, *Grave of the Fireflies* has been ranked as one of the greatest war films of all time and is recognized as a major work of Japanese animation.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn Kobe, the spirits of young war orphans Seita and Setsuko Yokokawa reunite and board a ghostly train as they recount how they survived the Bombing of Kobe in World War II.\n\n\nIn June 1945, American Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers destroy most of Kobe. Though Seita and Setsuko survive the bombing, their mother is severely injured and later dies. Seita conceals their mother's death from Setsuko to keep her happy, which she later learns of despite Seita's efforts. Seita and Setsuko move in with a distant aunt, and Seita retrieves supplies he buried before the bombing and gives everything to his aunt, save for a tin of Sakuma drops. As rations shrink and the number of refugees in the house grows, the aunt convinces Seita to sell his mother's silk kimono for rice. Seita uses some of his mother's money in the bank to buy supplies, but eventually, the aunt becomes resentful of the children, deeming them unworthy of earning her food.\n\n\nSeita and Setsuko leave their aunt's home after excessive insults, and they move into an abandoned bomb shelter. They release fireflies into the refuge for light. The next day, Setsuko is horrified to find that the insects have died. She buries them in a grave, asking why they and her mother had to die. As they run out of rice, Seita steals from farmers and loots homes during air raids, for which he is beaten and sent to the police by a farmer. The officer realizes Seita is stealing due to hunger and releases him. When Setsuko falls ill, a doctor explains that she is suffering from malnutrition. Desperate, Seita withdraws the last of the money from their mother's bank account. After doing so, he becomes distraught when he learns that Japan has surrendered and that his father, an Imperial Japanese Navy captain, is most likely dead, as most of Japan's navy has been sunk. Seita returns to Setsuko with food but finds her dying. She later dies as Seita finishes preparing the food. Seita cremates Setsuko's body and her stuffed doll in a straw casket. He carries her ashes in the candy tin along with his father's photograph.\n\n\nThat September, Seita dies of starvation at a Sannomiya train station surrounded by other malnourished people, as shown *in medias res*. A janitor is tasked with removing the bodies before the arrival of the Americans. The janitor sorts through Seita's possessions and finds the candy tin, which he throws into a field. Setsuko's ashes spread out, and her spirit springs from the container and is joined by Seita's spirit and a cloud of fireflies. They board a ghostly train and, throughout the journey, look back at the events leading to Seita's death. Their spirits later arrive at their destination, healthy and happy. Surrounded by fireflies, they rest on a hilltop bench overlooking present-day Kobe.\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character\n | Japanese voice actor\n | English voice actor\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Skypilot Entertainment/CPM (1998) | Toho/Seraphim/Sentai (2012) |\n| Seita Yokokawa (横川 清太) | Tsutomu Tatsumi | J.

Nosaka expressed surprise when an animated version was offered.[6] After seeing the storyboards, Nosaka concluded that it was not possible for such a story to have been made in any method other than animation and expressed surprise in how accurately the rice paddies and townscape were depicted.[6]\n\n\nIsao Takahata said that he was compelled to film the short story after seeing how the main character, Seita, \"was a unique wartime ninth grader\".[7] Takahata explained that any wartime story, whether animated or not animated, \"tends to be moving and tear-jerking\", and that young people develop an \"inferiority complex\" where they perceive people in wartime eras as being more noble and more able than they are, and therefore the audience believes that the story has nothing to do with them. Takahata argued that he wanted to dispel this mindset.[6] When Nosaka asked if the film characters were \"having fun\", Takahata answered that he clearly depicted Seita and Setsuko had \"substantial\" days and that they were \"*enjoying* their days\".[8] Takahata said that Setsuko was even more difficult to animate than Seita, and that he had never before depicted a girl younger than five.[6] Takahata said that \"In that respect, when you make the book into a movie, Setsuko becomes a tangible person\", and that four-year-olds often become more assertive and self-centered, and try to get their own ways during that age. He explained that while one could \"have a scene where Seita can't stand that anymore\", it is \"difficult to incorporate into a story\".[9] Takahata explained that the film is from Seita's point of view, \"and even objective passages are filtered through his feelings\".[8]\n\n\nTakahata said that he had considered using non-traditional animation methods, but because \"the schedule was planned and the movie's release date set, and the staff assembled, it was apparent there was no room for such a trial-and-error approach\".[8] He further remarked that he had difficulty animating the scenery since, in Japanese animation, one is \"not allowed\" to depict Japan in a realistic manner.[6] Animators often traveled to foreign countries to do research on how to depict them, but such research had not been done before for a Japanese setting.[6] While animating the movie, Takahata also created several different cuts of the scene in which Seita cremates Setsuko's body. Takahata spent a lot of time on this scene, trying to create the perfect iteration of it. Each of these cuts remained unfinished and unused in the end.[10]\n\n\nMost of the illustration outlines in the film are in brown, instead of the customary black. Black outlines were only used when it was absolutely necessary. Color coordinator Michiyo Yasuda said this was done to give the film a softer feel. Yasuda said that this technique had never been used in an anime before *Grave of the Fireflies*, \"and it was done on a challenge\".[6] Yasuda explained that brown is more difficult to use than black because it does not contrast as well as black.[6]\n\n\n*Grave of the* *Fireflies* was Takahata's first animated film produced with Studio Ghibli.[11]\n\n\nTakahata insisted on working with well known animators Yoshifumi Kondō who was working for Nippon Animation at the time and Yoshiyuki Momose.[12] Both animators played a pivotal role in creating fluid, realistic animations of the characters in the animation.[13][14]\n\n\nTakahata drew from his personal experience to create a realistic depiction of the air raid on Okayama. In an interview, he criticized TV shows and movies that had recreated images of incendiary bombs, \"They include no sparks or explosions, I was there and I experienced it, so I know what it was like.\"[15][16]\n\n\nThe film features Niteko-ike pond (ニテコ池), which is described as the \"birthplace\" of the novel and where Nosaka conducted his daily routines of dishwashing and personal ablutions. Notably, during the final days of the Pacific War, Nosaka, then 14 years old, sought refuge with his younger sister-in-law in a relative's house and nearby bomb shelters near the pond.[17][18]\n\n\nThe location and background in the film is based on a style created by 18th century Japanese artist Hiroshige and his follower Hergé, who created Tintin.[19] Film critic Roger Ebert examines the contrast of the style of the background in comparison to the cartoonish animation of the characters. He claims that there is an unusual amount of detail in the evocative landscape, while the characters are a take on the modern Japanese animation with childlike bodies and enormous eyes. The depiction of Seita and Setsuko have Ebert believe that this deliberate animation style embodies the true purpose of animation, which is to recreate the raw emotion of human life by simplifying reality to emphasize ideas.[20] He concludes his analysis with saying, \"Yes, it's a cartoon, and the kids have eyes like saucers, but it belongs on any list of the greatest war films ever made.\"[19] According to Wendy Goldberg, Takahata's film also includes criticism of the emphasis on nationalism in Japan. In a particular scene, Seita's desire to join his father reflects a \"national fantasy of war,\" which leads him to neglect his sister.[21]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nThe film score was composed by Michio Mamiya. Along with the original soundtrack, the song \"Home Sweet Home\", performed by coloratura soprano Amelita Galli-Curci, was included.[22] Dialogue of the film is part of the soundtrack as the music and dialogue are not separated in any way.[23] Mamiya is also a music specialist in baroque and classical music.\n\n\nDuring an interview about his music, Mamiya stated that he creates his music to encourage peace.[24] The songs in *Grave of the Fireflies* as well as other pieces by Michio Mamiya such as *Serenade No.3 \"Germ\"*, express this theme.[24]\n\n\n\nOriginal soundtrack[23]| No. | Title | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | \"Setsuko and Seita ~ Main Title\" (節子と清太~メインタイトル; *Setsuko to Seita ~ Mein Taitoru*) | 2:57 |\n| 2. | \"The Burnt-out Area\" (焼野原, *Yake Nohara*) | 6:51 |\n| 3. | \"Mother's Death\" (母の死, *Haha no Shi*) | 6:34 |\n| 4. | \"Early Summer\" (初夏, *Shoka*) | 3:14 |\n| 5. | \"At the Shore of the Pond\" (池のほとり, *Ike no Hotori*) | 2:21 |\n| 6. | \"To the Ocean\" (海へ, *Umi e*) | 1:37 |\n| 7. | \"The Beach\" (波打際, *Namiuchigiwa*) | 1:37 |\n| 8. | \"The Parasol\" (日傘, *Higasa*) | 2:26 |\n| 9. | \"Under the Cherry Blossoms\" (桜の下, *Sakura no Shita*) | 1:31 |\n| 10. | \"Drops\" (ドロップス, *Doroppusu*) | 2:13 |\n| 11. | \"Moving\" (引越し, *Hikkoshi*) | 2:17 |\n| 12. | \"Older Brother, Younger Sister\" (兄妹, *Keimai*) | 2:15 |\n| 13. | \"Fireflies\" (ほたる, *Hotaru*) | 4:12 |\n| 14. | \"Grave of the Fireflies\" (ほたるの墓, *Hotaru no Haka*) | 1:46 |\n| 15. | \"Sunset Colors\" (夕焼け, *Yūyake*) | 0:53 |\n| 16. | \"Scene of Carnage\" (修羅, *Shura*) | 3:08 |\n| 17. | \"Elegy / Song of Sorrow\" (悲歌, *Hika*) | 3:12 |\n| 18. | \"Two (People) ~ End Title\" (ふたり~エンドタイトル, *Futari ~ Endo Taitoru*) | 8:52 |\n| Total length: | 58:13 |\n\n## Themes and analysis[edit]\n\n\nIn his book about the film, Alex Dudok de Wit called *Grave of the Fireflies* an \"unusually personal adaptation\" of Nosaka's short story as Takahata had similar experiences during the war, though noted it deviated significantly in its portrayal of the children as ghosts in its opening sequence whereas the short story began immediately with the children losing their mother during the air raid.[25]\n\n\nSome critics in the West have viewed *Grave of the Fireflies* as an anti-war film due to the graphic and emotional depiction of the pernicious repercussions of war on a society, and the individuals therein. The film focuses its attention almost entirely on the personal tragedies that war gives rise to, rather than seeking to glamorize it as a heroic struggle between competing nations. It emphasizes that war is society's failure to perform its most important duty: to protect its own people.[26]\n\n\nHowever, Takahata repeatedly denied that the film was an anti-war film. In his own words, it \"is not at all an anti-war anime and contains absolutely no such message\". Instead, Takahata had intended to convey an image of the brother and sister living a failed life due to isolation from society and invoke sympathy particularly in people in their teens and twenties.[27][28]\n\n\nSince the film gives little context to the war, Takahata feared a politician could just as easily claim fighting is needed to avoid such tragedies. In general, he was skeptical that depictions of suffering in similar works, such as *Barefoot Gen*, actually prevent aggression. The director was nevertheless an anti-war advocate, a staunch supporter of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, and has openly criticized Japan's penchant for conformity, allowing them to be rallied against other nations. He expressed despair and anxiety whenever the youth are told to fall in line, a reminder that the country at its core has not changed.[29]\n\n\nDespite the public's emotional reaction, Takahata expressed that the purpose of the film was not to be a tragedy or make people cry.[30][31] Moreover, he regretted depicting Seita as a boy from that era because he wanted him to come off as a contemporary boy who acted like he had time-traveled to the period. He didn't intend for it to be retrospective or nostalgic. He wanted the Japanese audience to be weary of Seita's behavior.[30] Furthermore, he says that his decision to show the audience that Seita and Setsuko have died at the beginning of the movie is to protect the audience from heartbreak, \"If an audience knows at the beginning of the film that the two will eventually die, they are more prepared to watch the film in the first place. I try to lessen an audience's pain by revealing everything at the beginning.\"[15][16]\n\n\nThe fireflies in the film are portrayed as symbols of various themes such as the spirits of the lost children, the fires that burned the towns, Japanese soldiers, the machinery of war, and the regeneration of life through nature.[32] Okypo Moon states in her essay \"Marketing Nature in Rural Japan\", that hundreds of fireflies were caught nightly in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a shift to reinstate this tradition and \"there are now eighty five 'firefly villages' (*hotaru no sato*) registered at the Ministry of the Environment in Japan.[33] The movie uses fireflies to visually represent both deadly and beautiful imagery, such as fire-bombs and kamikazes.[32] Takahata chooses to use the *kanji* \"fire\" instead of the normal character for the word firefly in the title, which has been interpreted to represent the widespread burning of wooden houses in Japan. Critic Dennis H. Fukushima, Jr. believes that this modification of the title is to emphasize parallels between beauty and devastation, citing the relationship between fireflies, M-69 incendiary bombs, naval vessels, city lights, and human spirits.[32][20]\n\n\nIn the book *Imag(in)ing the war in Japan representing and responding to trauma in postwar literature and film*, David Stahl and Mark Williams commend the film for not emphasizing Japanese victimhood to avoid responsibility for atrocities of the war they played a role in. They interpret that Seita's character embodies working towards healing historical trauma and victimization, because it is his nationalistic pride and selfishness which ultimately contributed to his sister's death.[34]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe film was released on 16 April 1988, over 20 years from the publication of the short story.[9]\n\n\nThe initial Japanese theatrical release was accompanied by Hayao Miyazaki's light-hearted *My Neighbor Totoro* as a double feature. While the two films were marketed toward children and their parents, the starkly tragic nature of *Grave of the Fireflies* turned away many audiences. However, *Totoro* merchandise, particularly the stuffed animals of Totoro and Catbus, sold extremely well after the film and made overall profits for the company to the extent that it stabilized subsequent productions of Studio Ghibli.\n\n\n*Grave of the Fireflies* is the only theatrical Studio Ghibli feature film prior to *From Up on Poppy Hill* to which Disney never had North American distribution rights, since it was not produced by Ghibli for parent company Tokuma Shoten but for Shinchosha, the publisher of the original short story (although Disney has the Japanese home video distribution rights themselves, thus replacing the film's original Japanese home video distributor, Bandai Visual).[35] It was one of the last Studio Ghibli films to get an English-language premiere by GKIDS.[36]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Grave of the Fireflies* was released in Japan on VHS by Buena Vista Home Entertainment under the *Ghibli ga Ippai* Collection on 7 August 1998. On 29 July 2005, a DVD release was distributed through Warner Home Video. Walt Disney Studios Japan released the complete collector's edition DVD on 6 August 2008. WDSJ released the film on Blu-ray twice on 18 July 2012: one as a single release, and one in a two-film set with *My Neighbor Totoro* (even though Disney has never owned the North American rights, only the Japanese rights).\n\n\nIt was released on VHS in North America by Central Park Media in a subtitled form on 2 June 1993.[37] They later released the film with an English dub on VHS on 1 September 1998 (the day Disney released *Kiki's Delivery Service*) and an all-Regions DVD (which also included the original Japanese with English subtitles) on 7 October 1998. On 8 October 2002, it was later released on a two-disc DVD set, which once again included both the English dub and the original Japanese with English subtitles as well as the film's storyboards with the second disc containing a retrospective on the author of the original book, an interview with the director, and an interview with critic Roger Ebert, who felt the film was one of the greatest of all time.[38] It was released by Central Park Media one last time on 7 December 2004. Following the May 2009 bankruptcy and liquidation of Central Park Media,[39] ADV Films acquired the rights and re-released it on DVD on 7 July 2009.[40] Following the 1 September 2009 shutdown and re-branding of ADV,[41] their successor, Sentai Filmworks, rescued the film and released a remastered DVD on 6 March 2012, and planned to release the film on digital outlets.[42][43] A Blu-ray edition was released on 20 November 2012, featuring an all-new English dub produced by Seraphim Digital.[44]\n\n\nStudioCanal released a Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on 1 July 2013, followed by *Kiki's Delivery Service* on the same format.[45] It was the UK's tenth annual best-selling foreign language film on home video in 2019 (below seven other Japanese films, including six Hayao Miyazaki anime films).[46] Madman Entertainment released the film in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nThe film was modestly successful at the Japanese box office,[47] where it grossed ¥1.7 billion.[2] As part of the Studio Ghibli Fest 2018, the film had a limited theatrical release in the United States, grossing $516,962.[3]\n\n\nThe *Ghibli ga Ippai Collection* home video release of *Grave of the Fireflies* sold 400,000 copies in Japan.[48] At a price of at least ¥4,935,[49] this is equivalent to at least ¥1.974 billion in sales revenue.\n\n\nThe film received universal critical acclaim. Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* considered it to be one of the best and most powerful war films and, in 2000, included it on his list of great films.[38] The film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating based on 43 reviews with an average rating of 9.30/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"An achingly sad anti-war film, *Grave of the Fireflies* is one of Studio Ghibli's most profoundly beautiful, haunting works.\"[50] Metacritic assigned the film a score of 94 out of 100 based on 16 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[51]\n\n\nFilmmaker Akira Kurosawa praised the film and considered it his favourite Ghibli production. He wrote a letter of praise to Hayao Miyazaki, mistakenly believing he directed *Grave of the Fireflies*. Miyazaki himself praised the film as Takahata's masterpiece, but criticized Seita for not behaving how he believes the son of a navy lieutenant should behave.[52]\n\n\nThe film ranked number 12 on *Total Film*'s 50 greatest animated films.[53] It was also ranked at number 10 in *Time Out*'s \"The 50 greatest World War II movies\" list.[54] *Empire* magazine ranked the film at number 6 in its list of \"The Top 10 Depressing Movies\".[55] The film ranked number 19 on *Wizard's Anime* Magazine on their \"Top 50 Anime released in North America\".[56] *The Daily Star*, ranking the film 4th on its list of greatest short story adaptations, wrote that \"There is both much and little to say about the film. It is simply an experience—a trip through the lonely boroughs of humanity that the world collectively looked, and still looks, away from\".[57] Theron Martin of *Anime News Network* said that, in terms of the original U.S. Manga Corps dub, while the other voices were \"perfectly acceptable\", \"Setsuko just doesn't sound quite convincing as a four-year-old in English. That, unfortunately, is a big negative, since a good chunk of the pathos the movie delivers is at least partly dependent on that performance\".[42]\n\n\nOn 25 December 2016, Toei Company made a Twitter post that read \"Why did Kiriya have to die so soon?\" (なんできりやすぐ死んでしまうん, *Nande Kiriya sugu shinde shimaun?*) in order to promote an episode of *Kamen Rider Ex-Aid*. The hashtag became popular, but Toei deleted the tweet after receiving complaints that referencing the *Grave of the Fireflies* line \"Why do fireflies die so soon?\" (なんで蛍すぐ死んでしまうん, *Nande hotaru sugu shinde shimaun*) was in poor taste.[58] Before that, the ranking website Goo's readers voted the film's ending the number 1 most miserable of all anime films.[59]\n\n\nIn June 2018, USA Today ranked it 1st on the 100 best animated movies of all time.[60]\n\n\nWell-known film director and critic Haruo Mizuno [ja] reviewed the Grave of Fireflies during his popular TV series. He praised the film for the honorary image of the soldiers of Japan through the depiction of the fireflies, and the moving depiction of a heartbreaking experience many people of Japan had lived through.[61]\n\n\nAfter seeing the reactions of the audience after a screening of the film at *Festival « Pour éveiller les regards »*, Jean-Jacques Varret, head of Les Films du Paradoxe, knew he had to distribute it in France.[62] It was released in two Parisian arthouses and the reaction was modest. Following the release however, Les Films du Paradoxe chose to release the film on video cassettes and on the streaming service Canal+.[62][63]\n\n\n\n### Public reactions[edit]\n\n\nAfter the international release, it has been noted that different audiences have interpreted the film differently due to differences in culture. For instance, when the film was watched by a Japanese audience, Seita's decision to not come back to his aunt was seen as an understandable decision, as they were able to understand how Seita had been raised to value pride in himself and his country. But American and Australian audiences were more likely to perceive the decision as unwise, due to the cultural differences in order to try to save his sister and himself.[64][65]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989\n | Blue Ribbon Awards | Special Award | Isao Takahata | Won\n |\n| 1994\n | Chicago International Children's Film Festival | Animation Jury Award\n | Won\n |\n| Rights of the Child Award\n | Won\n |\n\n\n## Derivative works[edit]\n\n\n### Planned follow-up[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the success of *Grave of the Fireflies*, Takahata drew up an outline for a follow-up film, based on similar themes but set in 1939 at the start of the second World War. This film was called *Border 1939*, based on the novel *The Border* by Shin Shikata, and would have told the story of a Japanese teenager from colonial Seoul joining an anti-Japanese resistance group in Mongolia. The film was intended as an indictment of Japanese imperialist sentiment, which is briefly touched upon in *Grave of the Fireflies*. Although Takahata finished a full outline (which is republished in his book *Thoughts While Making Movies*), the film was canceled before production could start due to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Public opinion in Japan had turned against China, and Ghibli's distributor felt a film partly set there was too risky.[66]\n\n\n\n### 2005 live-action version[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grave of the Fireflies (2005 film)\n\nNTV in Japan produced a live-action TV drama of *Grave of the Fireflies*, in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II. The drama aired on 1 November 2005. Like the anime, the live-action version of *Grave of the Fireflies* focuses on two siblings struggling to survive the final months of the war in Kobe, Japan. Unlike the animated version, it tells the story from the point of view of their cousin (the aunt's daughter) and deals with the issue of how the war-time environment could change a kind lady into a hard-hearted woman. It stars Nanako Matsushima as the aunt, as well as Mao Inoue as their cousin.\n\n\n\n### 2008 live-action version[edit]\n\n\nA different live-action version was released in Japan on 5 July 2008, Reo Yoshitake [ja] as Seita, Rina Hatakeyama [ja] as Setsuko, Keiko Matsuzaka as the aunt, and Seiko Matsuda as the children's mother. Like the anime, this live-action version of *Grave of the Fireflies* focuses on two siblings struggling to survive the final months of the war in Kobe, Japan.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Anime and manga portal\n* ![icon](image)1980s portal\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n\n\n* Air raids against Japan during World War II\n* Evacuations of civilians in Japan during World War II\n* *Barefoot Gen*, a manga series set in the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.\n* *Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon*, a video game with similarities to the film.[67]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES* (12A)\".

It is based on the 1967 semi-autobiographical short story of the same name by Akiyuki Nosaka.\n\n\nThe film stars Tsutomu Tatsumi, Ayano Shiraishi [ja], Yoshiko Shinohara [ja] and Akemi Yamaguchi [ja]. Set in the city of Kobe, Japan in June 1945, it tells the story of two siblings and war orphans, Seita and Setsuko, and their desperate struggle to survive during the final months of the Second World War. Universally acclaimed, *Grave of the Fireflies* has been ranked as one of the greatest war films of all time and is recognized as a major work of Japanese animation.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn Kobe, the spirits of young war orphans Seita and Setsuko Yokokawa reunite and board a ghostly train as they recount how they survived the Bombing of Kobe in World War II.\n\n\nIn June 1945, American Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers destroy most of Kobe. Though Seita and Setsuko survive the bombing, their mother is severely injured and later dies. Seita conceals their mother's death from Setsuko to keep her happy, which she later learns of despite Seita's efforts. Seita and Setsuko move in with a distant aunt, and Seita retrieves supplies he buried before the bombing and gives everything to his aunt, save for a tin of Sakuma drops. As rations shrink and the number of refugees in the house grows, the aunt convinces Seita to sell his mother's silk kimono for rice. Seita uses some of his mother's money in the bank to buy supplies, but eventually, the aunt becomes resentful of the children, deeming them unworthy of earning her food.\n\n\nSeita and Setsuko leave their aunt's home after excessive insults, and they move into an abandoned bomb shelter. They release fireflies into the refuge for light. The next day, Setsuko is horrified to find that the insects have died. She buries them in a grave, asking why they and her mother had to die. As they run out of rice, Seita steals from farmers and loots homes during air raids, for which he is beaten and sent to the police by a farmer. The officer realizes Seita is stealing due to hunger and releases him. When Setsuko falls ill, a doctor explains that she is suffering from malnutrition. Desperate, Seita withdraws the last of the money from their mother's bank account. After doing so, he becomes distraught when he learns that Japan has surrendered and that his father, an Imperial Japanese Navy captain, is most likely dead, as most of Japan's navy has been sunk. Seita returns to Setsuko with food but finds her dying. She later dies as Seita finishes preparing the food. Seita cremates Setsuko's body and her stuffed doll in a straw casket. He carries her ashes in the candy tin along with his father's photograph.\n\n\nThat September, Seita dies of starvation at a Sannomiya train station surrounded by other malnourished people, as shown *in medias res*. A janitor is tasked with removing the bodies before the arrival of the Americans. The janitor sorts through Seita's possessions and finds the candy tin, which he throws into a field. Setsuko's ashes spread out, and her spirit springs from the container and is joined by Seita's spirit and a cloud of fireflies. They board a ghostly train and, throughout the journey, look back at the events leading to Seita's death. Their spirits later arrive at their destination, healthy and happy. Surrounded by fireflies, they rest on a hilltop bench overlooking present-day Kobe.\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character\n | Japanese voice actor\n | English voice actor\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Skypilot Entertainment/CPM (1998) | Toho/Seraphim/Sentai (2012) |\n| Seita Yokokawa (横川 清太) | Tsutomu Tatsumi | J.

Nosaka expressed surprise when an animated version was offered.[6] After seeing the storyboards, Nosaka concluded that it was not possible for such a story to have been made in any method other than animation and expressed surprise in how accurately the rice paddies and townscape were depicted.[6]\n\n\nIsao Takahata said that he was compelled to film the short story after seeing how the main character, Seita, \"was a unique wartime ninth grader\".[7] Takahata explained that any wartime story, whether animated or not animated, \"tends to be moving and tear-jerking\", and that young people develop an \"inferiority complex\" where they perceive people in wartime eras as being more noble and more able than they are, and therefore the audience believes that the story has nothing to do with them. Takahata argued that he wanted to dispel this mindset.[6] When Nosaka asked if the film characters were \"having fun\", Takahata answered that he clearly depicted Seita and Setsuko had \"substantial\" days and that they were \"*enjoying* their days\".[8] Takahata said that Setsuko was even more difficult to animate than Seita, and that he had never before depicted a girl younger than five.[6] Takahata said that \"In that respect, when you make the book into a movie, Setsuko becomes a tangible person\", and that four-year-olds often become more assertive and self-centered, and try to get their own ways during that age. He explained that while one could \"have a scene where Seita can't stand that anymore\", it is \"difficult to incorporate into a story\".[9] Takahata explained that the film is from Seita's point of view, \"and even objective passages are filtered through his feelings\".[8]\n\n\nTakahata said that he had considered using non-traditional animation methods, but because \"the schedule was planned and the movie's release date set, and the staff assembled, it was apparent there was no room for such a trial-and-error approach\".[8] He further remarked that he had difficulty animating the scenery since, in Japanese animation, one is \"not allowed\" to depict Japan in a realistic manner.[6] Animators often traveled to foreign countries to do research on how to depict them, but such research had not been done before for a Japanese setting.[6] While animating the movie, Takahata also created several different cuts of the scene in which Seita cremates Setsuko's body. Takahata spent a lot of time on this scene, trying to create the perfect iteration of it. Each of these cuts remained unfinished and unused in the end.[10]\n\n\nMost of the illustration outlines in the film are in brown, instead of the customary black. Black outlines were only used when it was absolutely necessary. Color coordinator Michiyo Yasuda said this was done to give the film a softer feel. Yasuda said that this technique had never been used in an anime before *Grave of the Fireflies*, \"and it was done on a challenge\".[6] Yasuda explained that brown is more difficult to use than black because it does not contrast as well as black.[6]\n\n\n*Grave of the* *Fireflies* was Takahata's first animated film produced with Studio Ghibli.[11]\n\n\nTakahata insisted on working with well known animators Yoshifumi Kondō who was working for Nippon Animation at the time and Yoshiyuki Momose.[12] Both animators played a pivotal role in creating fluid, realistic animations of the characters in the animation.[13][14]\n\n\nTakahata drew from his personal experience to create a realistic depiction of the air raid on Okayama. In an interview, he criticized TV shows and movies that had recreated images of incendiary bombs, \"They include no sparks or explosions, I was there and I experienced it, so I know what it was like.\"[15][16]\n\n\nThe film features Niteko-ike pond (ニテコ池), which is described as the \"birthplace\" of the novel and where Nosaka conducted his daily routines of dishwashing and personal ablutions. Notably, during the final days of the Pacific War, Nosaka, then 14 years old, sought refuge with his younger sister-in-law in a relative's house and nearby bomb shelters near the pond.[17][18]\n\n\nThe location and background in the film is based on a style created by 18th century Japanese artist Hiroshige and his follower Hergé, who created Tintin.[19] Film critic Roger Ebert examines the contrast of the style of the background in comparison to the cartoonish animation of the characters. He claims that there is an unusual amount of detail in the evocative landscape, while the characters are a take on the modern Japanese animation with childlike bodies and enormous eyes. The depiction of Seita and Setsuko have Ebert believe that this deliberate animation style embodies the true purpose of animation, which is to recreate the raw emotion of human life by simplifying reality to emphasize ideas.[20] He concludes his analysis with saying, \"Yes, it's a cartoon, and the kids have eyes like saucers, but it belongs on any list of the greatest war films ever made.\"[19] According to Wendy Goldberg, Takahata's film also includes criticism of the emphasis on nationalism in Japan. In a particular scene, Seita's desire to join his father reflects a \"national fantasy of war,\" which leads him to neglect his sister.[21]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nThe film score was composed by Michio Mamiya. Along with the original soundtrack, the song \"Home Sweet Home\", performed by coloratura soprano Amelita Galli-Curci, was included.[22] Dialogue of the film is part of the soundtrack as the music and dialogue are not separated in any way.[23] Mamiya is also a music specialist in baroque and classical music.\n\n\nDuring an interview about his music, Mamiya stated that he creates his music to encourage peace.[24] The songs in *Grave of the Fireflies* as well as other pieces by Michio Mamiya such as *Serenade No.3 \"Germ\"*, express this theme.[24]\n\n\n\nOriginal soundtrack[23]| No. | Title | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | \"Setsuko and Seita ~ Main Title\" (節子と清太~メインタイトル; *Setsuko to Seita ~ Mein Taitoru*) | 2:57 |\n| 2. | \"The Burnt-out Area\" (焼野原, *Yake Nohara*) | 6:51 |\n| 3. | \"Mother's Death\" (母の死, *Haha no Shi*) | 6:34 |\n| 4. | \"Early Summer\" (初夏, *Shoka*) | 3:14 |\n| 5. | \"At the Shore of the Pond\" (池のほとり, *Ike no Hotori*) | 2:21 |\n| 6. | \"To the Ocean\" (海へ, *Umi e*) | 1:37 |\n| 7. | \"The Beach\" (波打際, *Namiuchigiwa*) | 1:37 |\n| 8. | \"The Parasol\" (日傘, *Higasa*) | 2:26 |\n| 9. | \"Under the Cherry Blossoms\" (桜の下, *Sakura no Shita*) | 1:31 |\n| 10. | \"Drops\" (ドロップス, *Doroppusu*) | 2:13 |\n| 11. | \"Moving\" (引越し, *Hikkoshi*) | 2:17 |\n| 12. | \"Older Brother, Younger Sister\" (兄妹, *Keimai*) | 2:15 |\n| 13. | \"Fireflies\" (ほたる, *Hotaru*) | 4:12 |\n| 14. | \"Grave of the Fireflies\" (ほたるの墓, *Hotaru no Haka*) | 1:46 |\n| 15. | \"Sunset Colors\" (夕焼け, *Yūyake*) | 0:53 |\n| 16. | \"Scene of Carnage\" (修羅, *Shura*) | 3:08 |\n| 17. | \"Elegy / Song of Sorrow\" (悲歌, *Hika*) | 3:12 |\n| 18. | \"Two (People) ~ End Title\" (ふたり~エンドタイトル, *Futari ~ Endo Taitoru*) | 8:52 |\n| Total length: | 58:13 |\n\n## Themes and analysis[edit]\n\n\nIn his book about the film, Alex Dudok de Wit called *Grave of the Fireflies* an \"unusually personal adaptation\" of Nosaka's short story as Takahata had similar experiences during the war, though noted it deviated significantly in its portrayal of the children as ghosts in its opening sequence whereas the short story began immediately with the children losing their mother during the air raid.[25]\n\n\nSome critics in the West have viewed *Grave of the Fireflies* as an anti-war film due to the graphic and emotional depiction of the pernicious repercussions of war on a society, and the individuals therein. The film focuses its attention almost entirely on the personal tragedies that war gives rise to, rather than seeking to glamorize it as a heroic struggle between competing nations. It emphasizes that war is society's failure to perform its most important duty: to protect its own people.[26]\n\n\nHowever, Takahata repeatedly denied that the film was an anti-war film. In his own words, it \"is not at all an anti-war anime and contains absolutely no such message\". Instead, Takahata had intended to convey an image of the brother and sister living a failed life due to isolation from society and invoke sympathy particularly in people in their teens and twenties.[27][28]\n\n\nSince the film gives little context to the war, Takahata feared a politician could just as easily claim fighting is needed to avoid such tragedies. In general, he was skeptical that depictions of suffering in similar works, such as *Barefoot Gen*, actually prevent aggression. The director was nevertheless an anti-war advocate, a staunch supporter of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, and has openly criticized Japan's penchant for conformity, allowing them to be rallied against other nations. He expressed despair and anxiety whenever the youth are told to fall in line, a reminder that the country at its core has not changed.[29]\n\n\nDespite the public's emotional reaction, Takahata expressed that the purpose of the film was not to be a tragedy or make people cry.[30][31] Moreover, he regretted depicting Seita as a boy from that era because he wanted him to come off as a contemporary boy who acted like he had time-traveled to the period. He didn't intend for it to be retrospective or nostalgic. He wanted the Japanese audience to be weary of Seita's behavior.[30] Furthermore, he says that his decision to show the audience that Seita and Setsuko have died at the beginning of the movie is to protect the audience from heartbreak, \"If an audience knows at the beginning of the film that the two will eventually die, they are more prepared to watch the film in the first place. I try to lessen an audience's pain by revealing everything at the beginning.\"[15][16]\n\n\nThe fireflies in the film are portrayed as symbols of various themes such as the spirits of the lost children, the fires that burned the towns, Japanese soldiers, the machinery of war, and the regeneration of life through nature.[32] Okypo Moon states in her essay \"Marketing Nature in Rural Japan\", that hundreds of fireflies were caught nightly in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a shift to reinstate this tradition and \"there are now eighty five 'firefly villages' (*hotaru no sato*) registered at the Ministry of the Environment in Japan.[33] The movie uses fireflies to visually represent both deadly and beautiful imagery, such as fire-bombs and kamikazes.[32] Takahata chooses to use the *kanji* \"fire\" instead of the normal character for the word firefly in the title, which has been interpreted to represent the widespread burning of wooden houses in Japan. Critic Dennis H. Fukushima, Jr. believes that this modification of the title is to emphasize parallels between beauty and devastation, citing the relationship between fireflies, M-69 incendiary bombs, naval vessels, city lights, and human spirits.[32][20]\n\n\nIn the book *Imag(in)ing the war in Japan representing and responding to trauma in postwar literature and film*, David Stahl and Mark Williams commend the film for not emphasizing Japanese victimhood to avoid responsibility for atrocities of the war they played a role in. They interpret that Seita's character embodies working towards healing historical trauma and victimization, because it is his nationalistic pride and selfishness which ultimately contributed to his sister's death.[34]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe film was released on 16 April 1988, over 20 years from the publication of the short story.[9]\n\n\nThe initial Japanese theatrical release was accompanied by Hayao Miyazaki's light-hearted *My Neighbor Totoro* as a double feature. While the two films were marketed toward children and their parents, the starkly tragic nature of *Grave of the Fireflies* turned away many audiences. However, *Totoro* merchandise, particularly the stuffed animals of Totoro and Catbus, sold extremely well after the film and made overall profits for the company to the extent that it stabilized subsequent productions of Studio Ghibli.\n\n\n*Grave of the Fireflies* is the only theatrical Studio Ghibli feature film prior to *From Up on Poppy Hill* to which Disney never had North American distribution rights, since it was not produced by Ghibli for parent company Tokuma Shoten but for Shinchosha, the publisher of the original short story (although Disney has the Japanese home video distribution rights themselves, thus replacing the film's original Japanese home video distributor, Bandai Visual).[35] It was one of the last Studio Ghibli films to get an English-language premiere by GKIDS.[36]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Grave of the Fireflies* was released in Japan on VHS by Buena Vista Home Entertainment under the *Ghibli ga Ippai* Collection on 7 August 1998. On 29 July 2005, a DVD release was distributed through Warner Home Video. Walt Disney Studios Japan released the complete collector's edition DVD on 6 August 2008. WDSJ released the film on Blu-ray twice on 18 July 2012: one as a single release, and one in a two-film set with *My Neighbor Totoro* (even though Disney has never owned the North American rights, only the Japanese rights).\n\n\nIt was released on VHS in North America by Central Park Media in a subtitled form on 2 June 1993.[37] They later released the film with an English dub on VHS on 1 September 1998 (the day Disney released *Kiki's Delivery Service*) and an all-Regions DVD (which also included the original Japanese with English subtitles) on 7 October 1998. On 8 October 2002, it was later released on a two-disc DVD set, which once again included both the English dub and the original Japanese with English subtitles as well as the film's storyboards with the second disc containing a retrospective on the author of the original book, an interview with the director, and an interview with critic Roger Ebert, who felt the film was one of the greatest of all time.[38] It was released by Central Park Media one last time on 7 December 2004. Following the May 2009 bankruptcy and liquidation of Central Park Media,[39] ADV Films acquired the rights and re-released it on DVD on 7 July 2009.[40] Following the 1 September 2009 shutdown and re-branding of ADV,[41] their successor, Sentai Filmworks, rescued the film and released a remastered DVD on 6 March 2012, and planned to release the film on digital outlets.[42][43] A Blu-ray edition was released on 20 November 2012, featuring an all-new English dub produced by Seraphim Digital.[44]\n\n\nStudioCanal released a Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on 1 July 2013, followed by *Kiki's Delivery Service* on the same format.[45] It was the UK's tenth annual best-selling foreign language film on home video in 2019 (below seven other Japanese films, including six Hayao Miyazaki anime films).[46] Madman Entertainment released the film in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nThe film was modestly successful at the Japanese box office,[47] where it grossed ¥1.7 billion.[2] As part of the Studio Ghibli Fest 2018, the film had a limited theatrical release in the United States, grossing $516,962.[3]\n\n\nThe *Ghibli ga Ippai Collection* home video release of *Grave of the Fireflies* sold 400,000 copies in Japan.[48] At a price of at least ¥4,935,[49] this is equivalent to at least ¥1.974 billion in sales revenue.\n\n\nThe film received universal critical acclaim. Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* considered it to be one of the best and most powerful war films and, in 2000, included it on his list of great films.[38] The film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating based on 43 reviews with an average rating of 9.30/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"An achingly sad anti-war film, *Grave of the Fireflies* is one of Studio Ghibli's most profoundly beautiful, haunting works.\"[50] Metacritic assigned the film a score of 94 out of 100 based on 16 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[51]\n\n\nFilmmaker Akira Kurosawa praised the film and considered it his favourite Ghibli production. He wrote a letter of praise to Hayao Miyazaki, mistakenly believing he directed *Grave of the Fireflies*. Miyazaki himself praised the film as Takahata's masterpiece, but criticized Seita for not behaving how he believes the son of a navy lieutenant should behave.[52]\n\n\nThe film ranked number 12 on *Total Film*'s 50 greatest animated films.[53] It was also ranked at number 10 in *Time Out*'s \"The 50 greatest World War II movies\" list.[54] *Empire* magazine ranked the film at number 6 in its list of \"The Top 10 Depressing Movies\".[55] The film ranked number 19 on *Wizard's Anime* Magazine on their \"Top 50 Anime released in North America\".[56] *The Daily Star*, ranking the film 4th on its list of greatest short story adaptations, wrote that \"There is both much and little to say about the film. It is simply an experience—a trip through the lonely boroughs of humanity that the world collectively looked, and still looks, away from\".[57] Theron Martin of *Anime News Network* said that, in terms of the original U.S. Manga Corps dub, while the other voices were \"perfectly acceptable\", \"Setsuko just doesn't sound quite convincing as a four-year-old in English. That, unfortunately, is a big negative, since a good chunk of the pathos the movie delivers is at least partly dependent on that performance\".[42]\n\n\nOn 25 December 2016, Toei Company made a Twitter post that read \"Why did Kiriya have to die so soon?\" (なんできりやすぐ死んでしまうん, *Nande Kiriya sugu shinde shimaun?*) in order to promote an episode of *Kamen Rider Ex-Aid*. The hashtag became popular, but Toei deleted the tweet after receiving complaints that referencing the *Grave of the Fireflies* line \"Why do fireflies die so soon?\" (なんで蛍すぐ死んでしまうん, *Nande hotaru sugu shinde shimaun*) was in poor taste.[58] Before that, the ranking website Goo's readers voted the film's ending the number 1 most miserable of all anime films.[59]\n\n\nIn June 2018, USA Today ranked it 1st on the 100 best animated movies of all time.[60]\n\n\nWell-known film director and critic Haruo Mizuno [ja] reviewed the Grave of Fireflies during his popular TV series. He praised the film for the honorary image of the soldiers of Japan through the depiction of the fireflies, and the moving depiction of a heartbreaking experience many people of Japan had lived through.[61]\n\n\nAfter seeing the reactions of the audience after a screening of the film at *Festival « Pour éveiller les regards »*, Jean-Jacques Varret, head of Les Films du Paradoxe, knew he had to distribute it in France.[62] It was released in two Parisian arthouses and the reaction was modest. Following the release however, Les Films du Paradoxe chose to release the film on video cassettes and on the streaming service Canal+.[62][63]\n\n\n\n### Public reactions[edit]\n\n\nAfter the international release, it has been noted that different audiences have interpreted the film differently due to differences in culture. For instance, when the film was watched by a Japanese audience, Seita's decision to not come back to his aunt was seen as an understandable decision, as they were able to understand how Seita had been raised to value pride in himself and his country. But American and Australian audiences were more likely to perceive the decision as unwise, due to the cultural differences in order to try to save his sister and himself.[64][65]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989\n | Blue Ribbon Awards | Special Award | Isao Takahata | Won\n |\n| 1994\n | Chicago International Children's Film Festival | Animation Jury Award\n | Won\n |\n| Rights of the Child Award\n | Won\n |\n\n\n## Derivative works[edit]\n\n\n### Planned follow-up[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the success of *Grave of the Fireflies*, Takahata drew up an outline for a follow-up film, based on similar themes but set in 1939 at the start of the second World War. This film was called *Border 1939*, based on the novel *The Border* by Shin Shikata, and would have told the story of a Japanese teenager from colonial Seoul joining an anti-Japanese resistance group in Mongolia. The film was intended as an indictment of Japanese imperialist sentiment, which is briefly touched upon in *Grave of the Fireflies*. Although Takahata finished a full outline (which is republished in his book *Thoughts While Making Movies*), the film was canceled before production could start due to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Public opinion in Japan had turned against China, and Ghibli's distributor felt a film partly set there was too risky.[66]\n\n\n\n### 2005 live-action version[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grave of the Fireflies (2005 film)\n\nNTV in Japan produced a live-action TV drama of *Grave of the Fireflies*, in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II. The drama aired on 1 November 2005. Like the anime, the live-action version of *Grave of the Fireflies* focuses on two siblings struggling to survive the final months of the war in Kobe, Japan. Unlike the animated version, it tells the story from the point of view of their cousin (the aunt's daughter) and deals with the issue of how the war-time environment could change a kind lady into a hard-hearted woman. It stars Nanako Matsushima as the aunt, as well as Mao Inoue as their cousin.\n\n\n\n### 2008 live-action version[edit]\n\n\nA different live-action version was released in Japan on 5 July 2008, Reo Yoshitake [ja] as Seita, Rina Hatakeyama [ja] as Setsuko, Keiko Matsuzaka as the aunt, and Seiko Matsuda as the children's mother. Like the anime, this live-action version of *Grave of the Fireflies* focuses on two siblings struggling to survive the final months of the war in Kobe, Japan.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Anime and manga portal\n* ![icon](image)1980s portal\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n\n\n* Air raids against Japan during World War II\n* Evacuations of civilians in Japan during World War II\n* *Barefoot Gen*, a manga series set in the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.\n* *Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon*, a video game with similarities to the film.[67]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES* (12A)\".

It was animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Yamato Transport and the Nippon Television Network, and stars the voices of Minami Takayama, Rei Sakuma and Kappei Yamaguchi. The story follows Kiki, a young witch who moves to the port city of Koriko with her cat Jiji and starts a flying courier service.\n\n\nIn 1987, Group Fudosha asked Kadono's publishers for the rights to the novel to be made into a film by either Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata. Production began near the release of *My Neighbor Totoro* (1988). Miyazaki initially worked as producer, but took over directing from Sunao Katabuchi as he became more involved in the project. As the novel is based on a fictional northern European country, Miyazaki and his team traveled to locations such as Visby, Sweden, to research its landscape. Miyazaki altered the story, adding new scenes to emphasize the theme of independence and growing up. According to Miyazaki, the film portrays the gulf between independence and reliance among teenage Japanese girls.[1]\n\n\n*Kiki's Delivery Service* was released in Japan on July 29, 1989, by the Toei Company.[2] It was the first Studio Ghibli film to be successful on initial release, grossing a total of ¥4.3 billion ($31 million). It received critical acclaim and multiple awards. \n\n\nAn English dub was requested by Tokuma Shoten and was distributed by Streamline Pictures in 1989. Walt Disney Pictures produced an English dub via Buena Vista in 1997, which became the first film under a deal between Tokuma and Disney to be released in English. The dub stars the voices of Kirsten Dunst, Phil Hartman and Matthew Lawrence. \n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nThirteen-year-old trainee witch Kiki leaves home with her talking black cat Jiji. She flies on her broomstick to the port city of Koriko. While trying to find somewhere to live, Kiki is pursued by Tombo, a geeky boy obsessed with aviation who admires her flying ability.\n\n\nIn exchange for accommodation, Kiki helps Osono, the kind owner of a bakery who is pregnant with her first child. She opens a business delivering goods by broomstick—the \"Witch Delivery Service\". Her first delivery goes poorly; she is caught in the wind and loses the black cat toy she is supposed to deliver. Jiji pretends to be the toy until Kiki can retrieve the real item. She finds it in the home of a young painter, Ursula, who repairs and returns it to Kiki so she can complete the delivery and rescue Jiji.\n\n\nKiki accepts a party invitation from Tombo, but is delayed by her work and, exhausted, falls ill. When she recovers, Osono clandestinely arranges for Kiki to see Tombo again by assigning her a delivery addressed to him. After Kiki apologizes for missing the party, Tombo takes her for a test ride on the flying machine he is working on fashioned from a bicycle. Kiki warms up to Tombo but is intimidated by his friends, so she walks home.\n\n\nKiki becomes depressed and discovers she can no longer understand Jiji, who has befriended a pretty white cat named Lilly. She has also lost her flying ability and is forced to suspend her delivery business. Kiki has a surprise visit from Ursula, who determines that Kiki's crisis is a form of artist's block. Ursula suggests that if Kiki can find a new purpose, she will regain her powers.\n\n\nWhile Kiki is visiting a customer, she witnesses an airship accident on television. A strong gust leaves Tombo hanging from a rope in mid-air. Kiki regains her flying power and manages to rescue him. She recovers her confidence, resumes her delivery service, and writes a letter home saying that she and Jiji are happy.\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character name\n | Voice actor[3] |\n| --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese\n | Japanese\n | English\n |\n|  Original, 1989  | (Streamline Pictures/Tokuma, 1990) | (Disney, 1997/1998/2010) |\n| **Kiki** | *Kiki* (キキ) | Minami Takayama | Lisa Michelson | Kirsten Dunst |\n| **Jiji** | *Jiji* (ジジ) | Rei Sakuma | Kerrigan Mahan | Phil Hartman |\n| **Osono** | *Osono* (おソノ) | Keiko Toda | Alexandra Kenworthy | Tress MacNeille |\n| **Ursula** | *Urusura* (ウルスラ) | Minami Takayama | Edie Mirman | Janeane Garofalo |\n| **Tombo** | *Tonbo* (トンボ) | Kappei Yamaguchi | Eddie Frierson | Matthew Lawrence |\n| **Fukuo (Osono's husband)** | *Fukuo* (フクオ) | Kōichi Yamadera | Greg Snegoff | John Hostetter |\n| **Kokiri (Kiki's mother)** | *Kokiri* (コキリ) | Mieko Nobusawa | Barbara Goodson | Kath Soucie |\n| **Okino (Kiki's father)** | *Okino* (オキノ) | Kōichi Miura | John Dantona | Jeff Bennett |\n| **Madame** | *Madamu* (マダム) | Haruko Kato | Melanie MacQueen | Debbie Reynolds |\n| **Barsa** | *Barusa* (バルサ) | Hiroko Seki | Edie Mirman | Edie McClurg |\n| **Senior Witch** | *Jōkyū majo* (上級魔女) | Yūko Kobayashi | Wendee Lee | Debi Derryberry |\n| **Madame's Granddaughter** | *Madamu no magomusume* (マダムの孫娘) | Keiko Kagimoto | Sherry Lynn |\n| **Ket** | *Ketto* (ケット) | Yuriko Fuchizaki | Lara Cody | Pamela Adlon |\n| **Maki (Ket's aunt)** | *Maki* (マキ) | Kikuko Inoue | Julia Fletcher |\n| **Ket's mother** | *Ketto no haha* (ケットの母) | Mika Doi | Diane Michelle |\n| **Ket's father** | *Ketto no chichi* (ケットの父) | Takaya Hashi | Steve Kramer | John DeMita |\n| **Ket's grandmother** | *Ketto no o bāchan* (ケットのおばあちゃん) | Yoshiko Asai | Mike Reynolds | Julia Fletcher |\n| **Miss Dora** | *Misu dōra* (ミス・ドーラ) | Shō Saito | Diane Michelle | Fay Dewitt\n |\n| **Truck Driver** | *Torakku untenshu* (トラック運転手) | Michihiro Ikemizu | Unknown | Corey Burton |\n| **Hotel Receptionist** | *Hoteru no uketsuke-gakari* (ホテルの受付係) | Shinpachi Tsuji | Doug Stone | Matt K.

According to Helen McCarthy, the \"vibrant\" Stockholm-inspired city gives a sense of safety as well as independence.[4][5]\nA major theme of the film is maturity.[6] After leaving her parents who are supportive of her independence, Kiki has to face problems common to adolescence such as finding a job, seeking acceptance, and taking care of herself.[7] The concept of vulnerability is also examined closely in the film. Critic Mark Schilling notes a scene during Kiki's first night away from home where Kiki rushes back to her room and slams the door behind her to avoid being spotted by Fukuo. Fukuo, however, steps outside simply to stretch his arms, and Kiki's bizarrely shy behavior \"expresses [her] youth, vulnerability, and isolation.\"[8]\n\n\nAnother theme is the transition from traditional to contemporary. Kiki is shown to balance both of these qualities. For instance, Kiki observes the tradition of witches wearing black, but adorns her hair with a bright red bow.[9][*page needed*] Kiki also engages in other traditional methods, such as baking with a wood-burning stove and flying her mother's old broom.[9][*page needed*]\n\n\nKiki's loss of her witch powers is considered the worst crisis she has to face during the film.[10][11] Her loss of flight reflects the harm dealt to Kiki by her own self-doubts.[10][12] This hardship causes Kiki to realize that being vulnerable does not always lead to failure and can help her learn valuable lessons to better understand herself.[12] Petrana Radulovic also suggests that Jiji's bond with Kiki represents the experiences she had as a child, and that once Kiki loses her powers to talk to Jiji, she becomes more lonely.[13] Jiji had served as the wiser voice (imaginary companion) to Kiki, and she stopped being able to understand him the moment she struggles with self-doubt. According to Miyazaki himself, Jiji is meant to represent the immature side of Kiki, and her inability to talk to Jiji represents her newfound maturity at the end of the movie.[14]\n\n\nIn relation to Kiki's portrayal as a witch, some have drawn comparisons to historical or contemporary views on witches and witchcraft. The film incorporates some conventions from fairy-tales such as a black cat companion for Kiki,[15] Kiki's use of a broom for flight, and her black dress.[16] While girls with magical powers are common in Japanese television, Miyazaki noted that, \"the witchcraft has always merely been the means to fulfill the dreams of young girls. They have always become idols with no difficulties.\" In contrast, Kiki cannot use her powers as a means of wish fulfillment.[1]\n\n\nKiki has also been compared to other characters in Miyazaki's films. While there are overt differences in demeanor between Kiki and San from *Princess Mononoke*, a character who is motivated by anger, both characters take control over their own lives. This theme of remarkable independence is also seen in Miyazaki's earlier works, such as in Nausicaä in *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*.[17] Kiki is also compared to Chihiro of *Spirited Away* as they are both young girls attempting to seek independence without being rebellious. Both Chihiro and Kiki develop their independence with the help of their friends.[18]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Almedalen in Visby, Gotland. This was one of the regions where Miyazaki got inspiration from for the film.\n![](image)Kiki and Jiji illustrated by Akiko Hayashi from *Majo no Takkyūbin*. For the film, Kiki's hair was cut short to make the workload easier for the animators.[19]\nIn 1987, Group Fudosha asked Kadono's publishers for the rights to adapt Kadono's novel into a feature film directed by either Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata of Studio Ghibli. However, both of the chosen directors were busy, working on *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Grave of the Fireflies* respectively.[20] Miyazaki accepted the role of producer while the studio continued to search for a director.[21] Near the end of *Totoro*'s production, members of Studio Ghibli were being recruited as senior staff for *Kiki's Delivery Service*. The character design position was given to Katsuya Kondo, who was working with Miyazaki on *Totoro*. Hiroshi Ohno, who would later work on projects such as *Jin-Roh*, was hired as art director at the request of Kazuo Oga.\n\n\nMiyazaki chose Sunao Katabuchi as director. Katabuchi had worked with Miyazaki on *Sherlock Hound*; *Kiki's Delivery Service* was to have been his directorial debut. Studio Ghibli hired Nobuyuki Isshiki as script writer, but Miyazaki was dissatisfied by the first draft, finding it dry and too divergent from his own vision of the film.[22] Since the novel was based in a fictional country in northern Europe, Miyazaki and the senior staff went to research landscapes and other elements of the setting. Their main stops were Stockholm and Visby on the Swedish island of Gotland.[23] The architecture of Koriko is also based on the design of buildings from other cities such as Amsterdam, Paris, and San Francisco.[24]\n\n\nUpon their return to Japan, Miyazaki and the creative team worked on conceptual art and character designs. Miyazaki began significantly modifying the story, creating new ideas and changing existing ones.[25] *Majo no Takkyūbin*, the original children's book by Kadono that the movie was based on, is very different from Miyazaki's finished film. Kadono's novel is more episodic, consisting of small stories about various people and incidents Kiki encounters while making deliveries. Kiki overcomes many challenges in the novel based on \"her good heart\" and consequently expands her circle of friends. She faces no particular traumas or crises.[26] Many of the more dramatic elements, such as Kiki getting attacked by many crows, losing her powers or the airship incident at the film's climax, are not present in the original story. In order to more clearly illustrate the themes of struggling with independence and growing up in the film, Miyazaki intended to have Kiki face tougher challenges and create a more potent sense of loneliness.[26] One such challenge is Kiki's sudden loss of ability to fly. This event is only loosely paralleled in the novel, in which Kiki's broom breaks and merely requires her to fix it.[8] Miyazaki remarked, \"As movies always create a more realistic feeling, Kiki will suffer stronger setbacks and loneliness than in the original\".[8] Kadono was unhappy with the changes made between the book and film, to the point that the project was in danger of being shelved at the screenplay stage.[27] Miyazaki and Toshio Suzuki, the producer of Ghibli, went to the author's home and invited her to the film's studio. After her visit to the studio, Kadono decided to let the project continue.[21]\n\n\nMiyazaki finished the rough draft of the screenplay in June 1988 and presented it in July 1988. It was at this time that Miyazaki revealed that he had decided to direct the film, because he had influenced the project so much.[25] *Kiki's Delivery Service* was originally intended to be a 60-minute special, but expanded into a feature film running 102 minutes after Miyazaki completed storyboarding and scripting it.[28]\n\n\nThe word *takkyūbin* (宅急便, literally \"home-fast-mail\") in the Japanese title is a trademark of Yamato Transport (which stylized it in non-Japanese languages as *TA-Q-BIN*), though it is used today as a synonym for *takuhaibin* (宅配便, \"home-delivery-mail\"). While Yamato Transport sponsored the film, it initially did not approve of the usage of its trademark, since it was used by Kadano without permission. However, the success of the film restored relations between both her and Yamato Transport.[29][21]\n\n\nThe film had a production budget of ¥800 million ($6.9 million), making it one of the most expensive anime films up until then, along with *Akira* (1988)[30] and *Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise* (1987).[31]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kiki's Delivery Service |\n| --- |\n| Soundtrack album by Joe Hisaishi\n |\n| Released | August 25, 1989 |\n| Genre | * Anime music\n* Film score\n |\n| Length | 41:45 |\n| Label | Tokuma Shoten |\n| Producer | Joe Hisaishi |\n| Joe Hisaishi chronology |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *The Inners*(1989)\n | ***Kiki's Delivery Service***(1989)\n | *Pretender*(1989)\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAs with Hayao Miyazaki's other films, Joe Hisaishi composed the soundtrack for this film. Three months before the theatrical release of the movie, the image album for the film was published by Tokuma Shoten on Compact disc. A vocal album was released in November 1992.[32]\n\n\nFor the 1997 Disney English dub, much of the soundtrack was kept except for \"Message of Rouge\" and \"Wrapped in Kindness\", which were the opening and ending themes of the original Japanese version. Instead, they were replaced with two songs by Sydney Taylor; \"Soaring\" and \"I'm Gonna Fly\". Both these songs were removed from the 2010 DVD re-release of the English dub of *Kiki's Delivery Service*.[33] Paul Chihara composed the music for the dub, adding music to scenes that were silent in the original Japanese version.[34]\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic releases for *Kiki's Delivery Service* [32]\n| Release date\n | English title\n | Japanese title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| April 10, 1989\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service Image Album* | 魔女の宅急便 イメージソング集\n |\n| August 25, 1989\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service Soundtrack* | 魔女の宅急便 サウンドトラック\n |\n| December 21, 1989\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service Hi-Tech Series* | 魔女の宅急便 ハイテックシリーズ\n |\n| November 25, 1992\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service Vocal Album* | 魔女の宅急便 ヴォーカルアルバム\n |\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*Kiki's Delivery Service* premiered on July 29, 1989, in Japanese theaters. It sold around 2,640,000 tickets in Japan,[35][36] with a total box office of ¥4.3 billion (US$31 million) in gross receipts.[37] It was become the first Studio Ghibli film to be successful during its initial release and was one of 1989's highest-grossing films in Japan.[35][38] It also grossed HK$4.04 million (US$519,000) in Hong Kong upon release there in 1990.[3] Later re-releases and international releases between 2004 and 2023 grossed US$10,366,082 worldwide,[39] adding up to $41,885,082 grossed worldwide as of 2023[update].[note 1] In the United Kingdom, it was 2018's seventh best-selling foreign-language film on home video,[40] and 2019's fifth best-selling foreign-language film (below four other Japanese films, including three Miyazaki anime films).[41]\n\n\n\n### English dubs[edit]\n\n\nThe first official English dub of *Kiki's Delivery Service* was produced by Carl Macek of Streamline Pictures, who previously dubbed *Castle in the Sky* and *My Neighbor Totoro* at the request of Tokuma Shoten for Japan Airlines' international flights. Tokuma was satisfied with the dub of *My Neighbor Totoro*, which allowed Carl to work on the dub of *Kiki's Delivery Service* in November 1989.[42] This dub is available only in the Ghibli Laserdisc Box Set.[21]\n\n\nDisney produced an English dub in 1997,[34] and *Kiki* was the first film released through a deal Disney made with Tokuma.[36] It premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival on May 23, 1998, and was released on both VHS and Laserdisc by Buena Vista Home Video in September 1998.[3][33] It became the eighth-most sold film on Blockbuster during its first week of availability,[43] and sold over 900,000 copies by September 28, 1998.[44] It was released on home media in North America on 2003, alongside the releases of *Spirited Away* and *Castle in the Sky*.[45] In the United Kingdom, the film was released on Blu-ray by StudioCanal alongside a release of *Grave of the Fireflies* on July 1, 2013,[46] while in North America, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray Disc alongside *Princess Mononoke* and *The Wind Rises*, on November 18, 2014.[47] GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017.[48] In 2020, it was announced that both the original Japanese version and the Disney dub were made available to be streamed on Netflix.[49]\n\n\n\n### Differences between versions[edit]\n\n\nDisney's English dub of *Kiki's Delivery Service* contained some changes, which have been described as \"pragmatic\".[50] The changes were approved by Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.[51][52] There are a number of additions and embellishments to the film's musical score, and several lavish sound effects over sections that are silent in the Japanese original.\n\n\nThe depiction of the cat, Jiji, is changed significantly in the Disney version. In the Japanese version Jiji is voiced by Rei Sakuma, while in the English version Jiji is voiced by comedian Phil Hartman. In Japanese culture, cats are usually depicted with feminine voices, whereas in American culture their voices are more gender-specific.[53] A number of Hartman's lines exist where Jiji simply says nothing in the original. Jiji's personality is notably different between the two versions, showing a more cynical and sarcastic attitude in the Disney English version as opposed to cautious and conscientious in the original Japanese. In the original Japanese script, Kiki loses her ability to communicate with Jiji permanently, but the American version adds a line that implies that she is once again able to understand him at the end of the film.[54] More minor changes to appeal to the different teenage habits of the day include Kiki drinking hot chocolate instead of coffee and referring to \"cute boys\" instead of to \"the disco\".[55]\n\n\nHowever, when Disney re-released the film on DVD in 2010, several elements of the English dub were changed, reverting more towards the original Japanese version. Hartman's ad-libbed lines as Jiji were removed, and Forest's opening and ending songs were replaced with Arai's original Japanese opening and ending songs.[56] Additionally, Jiji does not talk again at the end, implying that Kiki never regains the ability to talk to him, and many of the sound effects added to the original English version have been removed. The English subtitled script used for the original VHS subbed release and the later DVD release more closely adheres to the Japanese script, but still contains a few alterations. Tokuma mistakenly believed the Streamline dub was an accurate translation of the film and offered it to Disney to use as subtitles. As a result, several additions from the dub appear in the subtitles regardless of whether or not they are present in the film.[21]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nAt the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 98% of 43 reviews are positive for *Kiki's Delivery Service*, and the average rating is 8.1/10. The critics consensus reads, \"*Kiki's Delivery Service* is a heartwarming, gorgeously-rendered tale of a young witch discovering her place in the world.\"[57] Metacritic, another aggregator, collected 15 reviews and calculated an average rating of 85 out of 100, signifying \"universal acclaim\".[58] On September 4, 1998, *Entertainment Weekly* rated it as Video of the Year, and on September 12, 1998, it was the first video release to be reviewed as a normal film on *Siskel and Ebert* rather than on the \"Video Pick of the Week\" section.[43] Gene Siskel of the *Chicago Tribune* and Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave it \"two thumbs up\"[59][60] and Ebert went on to rank it as one of the best animated films released in the U.S. in 1998.[61] The film ranked #12 on *Wizard's Anime* Magazine's list of the \"Top 50 Anime released in North America\".[62] Other reviews were very positive as well. Andrew Johnston wrote in Time Out New York: \"Although the story has a clear moral about learning to develop self-confidence, *Kiki* is never preachy. The story is given time to unfold at a natural pace..., which contributes greatly to the sense of depth it conveys.\"[63]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Category\n | Result\n | Recipient\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 12th Anime Grand Prix | Best Anime\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | [64] |\n| Best Female Character\n | Won\n | Kiki\n |\n| Best Anime Theme Song\n | Won\n | \"*Yasashisa ni Tsutsumaretanara*\"\n |\n| 44th Mainichi Film Award | *Best Animated Film* | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | [65] |\n| Kinema Junpo Awards | Readers' Choice Award\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | [66] |\n| 13th Japan Academy Prize | Special Award\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | [67] |\n| Popularity Award\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* |\n| 7th Annual Golden Gross Award\n | Gold, Japanese Film\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | [68] |\n| 7th Annual Money Making Director's Award\n | Best Director\n | Won\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n |\n| The Movie's Day\n | Special Achievement Award\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* |\n| The Erandole Award\n | Special Award\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* |\n| Japan Cinema Association Award\n | Best Film\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* |\n| Best Director\n | Won\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n |\n| Agency of Cultural Affairs | Best Film\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* |\n| Tokyo Metropolitan Cultural Honor\n | Best Film\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* |\n\n\n## Other media[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\nA four-volume ani-manga book series using stills from the film was published in Japan by Tokuma Shoten between August and September of 1989.[69][70] An English translation would later be published by Viz Media between April and July 2006.[71][72][73][74] Tokuma also published a 208-page art book on February 11, 1989, and Viz Media published the English translation of it on May 9, 2006.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Musicals[edit]\n\n\nA musical based on the film ran at the Southwark Playhouse in the UK from December 8, 2016 to January 7, 2017, and officially opened on December 13, 2016.

The first ran in Tokyo and Osaka from June 2017 to September 2017, and starred Moka Kamishirasi as Kiki and Aran Abe as Tombo. A second one ran in 2018 which starred Riko Fukumoto as Kiki. The most recent one ran from March 2021 to April 2021 in Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka.

It was animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Yamato Transport and the Nippon Television Network, and stars the voices of Minami Takayama, Rei Sakuma and Kappei Yamaguchi. The story follows Kiki, a young witch who moves to the port city of Koriko with her cat Jiji and starts a flying courier service.\n\n\nIn 1987, Group Fudosha asked Kadono's publishers for the rights to the novel to be made into a film by either Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata. Production began near the release of *My Neighbor Totoro* (1988). Miyazaki initially worked as producer, but took over directing from Sunao Katabuchi as he became more involved in the project. As the novel is based on a fictional northern European country, Miyazaki and his team traveled to locations such as Visby, Sweden, to research its landscape. Miyazaki altered the story, adding new scenes to emphasize the theme of independence and growing up. According to Miyazaki, the film portrays the gulf between independence and reliance among teenage Japanese girls.[1]\n\n\n*Kiki's Delivery Service* was released in Japan on July 29, 1989, by the Toei Company.[2] It was the first Studio Ghibli film to be successful on initial release, grossing a total of ¥4.3 billion ($31 million). It received critical acclaim and multiple awards. \n\n\nAn English dub was requested by Tokuma Shoten and was distributed by Streamline Pictures in 1989. Walt Disney Pictures produced an English dub via Buena Vista in 1997, which became the first film under a deal between Tokuma and Disney to be released in English. The dub stars the voices of Kirsten Dunst, Phil Hartman and Matthew Lawrence. \n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nThirteen-year-old trainee witch Kiki leaves home with her talking black cat Jiji. She flies on her broomstick to the port city of Koriko. While trying to find somewhere to live, Kiki is pursued by Tombo, a geeky boy obsessed with aviation who admires her flying ability.\n\n\nIn exchange for accommodation, Kiki helps Osono, the kind owner of a bakery who is pregnant with her first child. She opens a business delivering goods by broomstick—the \"Witch Delivery Service\". Her first delivery goes poorly; she is caught in the wind and loses the black cat toy she is supposed to deliver. Jiji pretends to be the toy until Kiki can retrieve the real item. She finds it in the home of a young painter, Ursula, who repairs and returns it to Kiki so she can complete the delivery and rescue Jiji.\n\n\nKiki accepts a party invitation from Tombo, but is delayed by her work and, exhausted, falls ill. When she recovers, Osono clandestinely arranges for Kiki to see Tombo again by assigning her a delivery addressed to him. After Kiki apologizes for missing the party, Tombo takes her for a test ride on the flying machine he is working on fashioned from a bicycle. Kiki warms up to Tombo but is intimidated by his friends, so she walks home.\n\n\nKiki becomes depressed and discovers she can no longer understand Jiji, who has befriended a pretty white cat named Lilly. She has also lost her flying ability and is forced to suspend her delivery business. Kiki has a surprise visit from Ursula, who determines that Kiki's crisis is a form of artist's block. Ursula suggests that if Kiki can find a new purpose, she will regain her powers.\n\n\nWhile Kiki is visiting a customer, she witnesses an airship accident on television. A strong gust leaves Tombo hanging from a rope in mid-air. Kiki regains her flying power and manages to rescue him. She recovers her confidence, resumes her delivery service, and writes a letter home saying that she and Jiji are happy.\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character name\n | Voice actor[3] |\n| --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese\n | Japanese\n | English\n |\n|  Original, 1989  | (Streamline Pictures/Tokuma, 1990) | (Disney, 1997/1998/2010) |\n| **Kiki** | *Kiki* (キキ) | Minami Takayama | Lisa Michelson | Kirsten Dunst |\n| **Jiji** | *Jiji* (ジジ) | Rei Sakuma | Kerrigan Mahan | Phil Hartman |\n| **Osono** | *Osono* (おソノ) | Keiko Toda | Alexandra Kenworthy | Tress MacNeille |\n| **Ursula** | *Urusura* (ウルスラ) | Minami Takayama | Edie Mirman | Janeane Garofalo |\n| **Tombo** | *Tonbo* (トンボ) | Kappei Yamaguchi | Eddie Frierson | Matthew Lawrence |\n| **Fukuo (Osono's husband)** | *Fukuo* (フクオ) | Kōichi Yamadera | Greg Snegoff | John Hostetter |\n| **Kokiri (Kiki's mother)** | *Kokiri* (コキリ) | Mieko Nobusawa | Barbara Goodson | Kath Soucie |\n| **Okino (Kiki's father)** | *Okino* (オキノ) | Kōichi Miura | John Dantona | Jeff Bennett |\n| **Madame** | *Madamu* (マダム) | Haruko Kato | Melanie MacQueen | Debbie Reynolds |\n| **Barsa** | *Barusa* (バルサ) | Hiroko Seki | Edie Mirman | Edie McClurg |\n| **Senior Witch** | *Jōkyū majo* (上級魔女) | Yūko Kobayashi | Wendee Lee | Debi Derryberry |\n| **Madame's Granddaughter** | *Madamu no magomusume* (マダムの孫娘) | Keiko Kagimoto | Sherry Lynn |\n| **Ket** | *Ketto* (ケット) | Yuriko Fuchizaki | Lara Cody | Pamela Adlon |\n| **Maki (Ket's aunt)** | *Maki* (マキ) | Kikuko Inoue | Julia Fletcher |\n| **Ket's mother** | *Ketto no haha* (ケットの母) | Mika Doi | Diane Michelle |\n| **Ket's father** | *Ketto no chichi* (ケットの父) | Takaya Hashi | Steve Kramer | John DeMita |\n| **Ket's grandmother** | *Ketto no o bāchan* (ケットのおばあちゃん) | Yoshiko Asai | Mike Reynolds | Julia Fletcher |\n| **Miss Dora** | *Misu dōra* (ミス・ドーラ) | Shō Saito | Diane Michelle | Fay Dewitt\n |\n| **Truck Driver** | *Torakku untenshu* (トラック運転手) | Michihiro Ikemizu | Unknown | Corey Burton |\n| **Hotel Receptionist** | *Hoteru no uketsuke-gakari* (ホテルの受付係) | Shinpachi Tsuji | Doug Stone | Matt K.

According to Helen McCarthy, the \"vibrant\" Stockholm-inspired city gives a sense of safety as well as independence.[4][5]\nA major theme of the film is maturity.[6] After leaving her parents who are supportive of her independence, Kiki has to face problems common to adolescence such as finding a job, seeking acceptance, and taking care of herself.[7] The concept of vulnerability is also examined closely in the film. Critic Mark Schilling notes a scene during Kiki's first night away from home where Kiki rushes back to her room and slams the door behind her to avoid being spotted by Fukuo. Fukuo, however, steps outside simply to stretch his arms, and Kiki's bizarrely shy behavior \"expresses [her] youth, vulnerability, and isolation.\"[8]\n\n\nAnother theme is the transition from traditional to contemporary. Kiki is shown to balance both of these qualities. For instance, Kiki observes the tradition of witches wearing black, but adorns her hair with a bright red bow.[9][*page needed*] Kiki also engages in other traditional methods, such as baking with a wood-burning stove and flying her mother's old broom.[9][*page needed*]\n\n\nKiki's loss of her witch powers is considered the worst crisis she has to face during the film.[10][11] Her loss of flight reflects the harm dealt to Kiki by her own self-doubts.[10][12] This hardship causes Kiki to realize that being vulnerable does not always lead to failure and can help her learn valuable lessons to better understand herself.[12] Petrana Radulovic also suggests that Jiji's bond with Kiki represents the experiences she had as a child, and that once Kiki loses her powers to talk to Jiji, she becomes more lonely.[13] Jiji had served as the wiser voice (imaginary companion) to Kiki, and she stopped being able to understand him the moment she struggles with self-doubt. According to Miyazaki himself, Jiji is meant to represent the immature side of Kiki, and her inability to talk to Jiji represents her newfound maturity at the end of the movie.[14]\n\n\nIn relation to Kiki's portrayal as a witch, some have drawn comparisons to historical or contemporary views on witches and witchcraft. The film incorporates some conventions from fairy-tales such as a black cat companion for Kiki,[15] Kiki's use of a broom for flight, and her black dress.[16] While girls with magical powers are common in Japanese television, Miyazaki noted that, \"the witchcraft has always merely been the means to fulfill the dreams of young girls. They have always become idols with no difficulties.\" In contrast, Kiki cannot use her powers as a means of wish fulfillment.[1]\n\n\nKiki has also been compared to other characters in Miyazaki's films. While there are overt differences in demeanor between Kiki and San from *Princess Mononoke*, a character who is motivated by anger, both characters take control over their own lives. This theme of remarkable independence is also seen in Miyazaki's earlier works, such as in Nausicaä in *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*.[17] Kiki is also compared to Chihiro of *Spirited Away* as they are both young girls attempting to seek independence without being rebellious. Both Chihiro and Kiki develop their independence with the help of their friends.[18]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Almedalen in Visby, Gotland. This was one of the regions where Miyazaki got inspiration from for the film.\n![](image)Kiki and Jiji illustrated by Akiko Hayashi from *Majo no Takkyūbin*. For the film, Kiki's hair was cut short to make the workload easier for the animators.[19]\nIn 1987, Group Fudosha asked Kadono's publishers for the rights to adapt Kadono's novel into a feature film directed by either Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata of Studio Ghibli. However, both of the chosen directors were busy, working on *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Grave of the Fireflies* respectively.[20] Miyazaki accepted the role of producer while the studio continued to search for a director.[21] Near the end of *Totoro*'s production, members of Studio Ghibli were being recruited as senior staff for *Kiki's Delivery Service*. The character design position was given to Katsuya Kondo, who was working with Miyazaki on *Totoro*. Hiroshi Ohno, who would later work on projects such as *Jin-Roh*, was hired as art director at the request of Kazuo Oga.\n\n\nMiyazaki chose Sunao Katabuchi as director. Katabuchi had worked with Miyazaki on *Sherlock Hound*; *Kiki's Delivery Service* was to have been his directorial debut. Studio Ghibli hired Nobuyuki Isshiki as script writer, but Miyazaki was dissatisfied by the first draft, finding it dry and too divergent from his own vision of the film.[22] Since the novel was based in a fictional country in northern Europe, Miyazaki and the senior staff went to research landscapes and other elements of the setting. Their main stops were Stockholm and Visby on the Swedish island of Gotland.[23] The architecture of Koriko is also based on the design of buildings from other cities such as Amsterdam, Paris, and San Francisco.[24]\n\n\nUpon their return to Japan, Miyazaki and the creative team worked on conceptual art and character designs. Miyazaki began significantly modifying the story, creating new ideas and changing existing ones.[25] *Majo no Takkyūbin*, the original children's book by Kadono that the movie was based on, is very different from Miyazaki's finished film. Kadono's novel is more episodic, consisting of small stories about various people and incidents Kiki encounters while making deliveries. Kiki overcomes many challenges in the novel based on \"her good heart\" and consequently expands her circle of friends. She faces no particular traumas or crises.[26] Many of the more dramatic elements, such as Kiki getting attacked by many crows, losing her powers or the airship incident at the film's climax, are not present in the original story. In order to more clearly illustrate the themes of struggling with independence and growing up in the film, Miyazaki intended to have Kiki face tougher challenges and create a more potent sense of loneliness.[26] One such challenge is Kiki's sudden loss of ability to fly. This event is only loosely paralleled in the novel, in which Kiki's broom breaks and merely requires her to fix it.[8] Miyazaki remarked, \"As movies always create a more realistic feeling, Kiki will suffer stronger setbacks and loneliness than in the original\".[8] Kadono was unhappy with the changes made between the book and film, to the point that the project was in danger of being shelved at the screenplay stage.[27] Miyazaki and Toshio Suzuki, the producer of Ghibli, went to the author's home and invited her to the film's studio. After her visit to the studio, Kadono decided to let the project continue.[21]\n\n\nMiyazaki finished the rough draft of the screenplay in June 1988 and presented it in July 1988. It was at this time that Miyazaki revealed that he had decided to direct the film, because he had influenced the project so much.[25] *Kiki's Delivery Service* was originally intended to be a 60-minute special, but expanded into a feature film running 102 minutes after Miyazaki completed storyboarding and scripting it.[28]\n\n\nThe word *takkyūbin* (宅急便, literally \"home-fast-mail\") in the Japanese title is a trademark of Yamato Transport (which stylized it in non-Japanese languages as *TA-Q-BIN*), though it is used today as a synonym for *takuhaibin* (宅配便, \"home-delivery-mail\"). While Yamato Transport sponsored the film, it initially did not approve of the usage of its trademark, since it was used by Kadano without permission. However, the success of the film restored relations between both her and Yamato Transport.[29][21]\n\n\nThe film had a production budget of ¥800 million ($6.9 million), making it one of the most expensive anime films up until then, along with *Akira* (1988)[30] and *Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise* (1987).[31]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kiki's Delivery Service |\n| --- |\n| Soundtrack album by Joe Hisaishi\n |\n| Released | August 25, 1989 |\n| Genre | * Anime music\n* Film score\n |\n| Length | 41:45 |\n| Label | Tokuma Shoten |\n| Producer | Joe Hisaishi |\n| Joe Hisaishi chronology |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *The Inners*(1989)\n | ***Kiki's Delivery Service***(1989)\n | *Pretender*(1989)\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAs with Hayao Miyazaki's other films, Joe Hisaishi composed the soundtrack for this film. Three months before the theatrical release of the movie, the image album for the film was published by Tokuma Shoten on Compact disc. A vocal album was released in November 1992.[32]\n\n\nFor the 1997 Disney English dub, much of the soundtrack was kept except for \"Message of Rouge\" and \"Wrapped in Kindness\", which were the opening and ending themes of the original Japanese version. Instead, they were replaced with two songs by Sydney Taylor; \"Soaring\" and \"I'm Gonna Fly\". Both these songs were removed from the 2010 DVD re-release of the English dub of *Kiki's Delivery Service*.[33] Paul Chihara composed the music for the dub, adding music to scenes that were silent in the original Japanese version.[34]\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic releases for *Kiki's Delivery Service* [32]\n| Release date\n | English title\n | Japanese title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| April 10, 1989\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service Image Album* | 魔女の宅急便 イメージソング集\n |\n| August 25, 1989\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service Soundtrack* | 魔女の宅急便 サウンドトラック\n |\n| December 21, 1989\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service Hi-Tech Series* | 魔女の宅急便 ハイテックシリーズ\n |\n| November 25, 1992\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service Vocal Album* | 魔女の宅急便 ヴォーカルアルバム\n |\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*Kiki's Delivery Service* premiered on July 29, 1989, in Japanese theaters. It sold around 2,640,000 tickets in Japan,[35][36] with a total box office of ¥4.3 billion (US$31 million) in gross receipts.[37] It was become the first Studio Ghibli film to be successful during its initial release and was one of 1989's highest-grossing films in Japan.[35][38] It also grossed HK$4.04 million (US$519,000) in Hong Kong upon release there in 1990.[3] Later re-releases and international releases between 2004 and 2023 grossed US$10,366,082 worldwide,[39] adding up to $41,885,082 grossed worldwide as of 2023[update].[note 1] In the United Kingdom, it was 2018's seventh best-selling foreign-language film on home video,[40] and 2019's fifth best-selling foreign-language film (below four other Japanese films, including three Miyazaki anime films).[41]\n\n\n\n### English dubs[edit]\n\n\nThe first official English dub of *Kiki's Delivery Service* was produced by Carl Macek of Streamline Pictures, who previously dubbed *Castle in the Sky* and *My Neighbor Totoro* at the request of Tokuma Shoten for Japan Airlines' international flights. Tokuma was satisfied with the dub of *My Neighbor Totoro*, which allowed Carl to work on the dub of *Kiki's Delivery Service* in November 1989.[42] This dub is available only in the Ghibli Laserdisc Box Set.[21]\n\n\nDisney produced an English dub in 1997,[34] and *Kiki* was the first film released through a deal Disney made with Tokuma.[36] It premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival on May 23, 1998, and was released on both VHS and Laserdisc by Buena Vista Home Video in September 1998.[3][33] It became the eighth-most sold film on Blockbuster during its first week of availability,[43] and sold over 900,000 copies by September 28, 1998.[44] It was released on home media in North America on 2003, alongside the releases of *Spirited Away* and *Castle in the Sky*.[45] In the United Kingdom, the film was released on Blu-ray by StudioCanal alongside a release of *Grave of the Fireflies* on July 1, 2013,[46] while in North America, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray Disc alongside *Princess Mononoke* and *The Wind Rises*, on November 18, 2014.[47] GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017.[48] In 2020, it was announced that both the original Japanese version and the Disney dub were made available to be streamed on Netflix.[49]\n\n\n\n### Differences between versions[edit]\n\n\nDisney's English dub of *Kiki's Delivery Service* contained some changes, which have been described as \"pragmatic\".[50] The changes were approved by Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.[51][52] There are a number of additions and embellishments to the film's musical score, and several lavish sound effects over sections that are silent in the Japanese original.\n\n\nThe depiction of the cat, Jiji, is changed significantly in the Disney version. In the Japanese version Jiji is voiced by Rei Sakuma, while in the English version Jiji is voiced by comedian Phil Hartman. In Japanese culture, cats are usually depicted with feminine voices, whereas in American culture their voices are more gender-specific.[53] A number of Hartman's lines exist where Jiji simply says nothing in the original. Jiji's personality is notably different between the two versions, showing a more cynical and sarcastic attitude in the Disney English version as opposed to cautious and conscientious in the original Japanese. In the original Japanese script, Kiki loses her ability to communicate with Jiji permanently, but the American version adds a line that implies that she is once again able to understand him at the end of the film.[54] More minor changes to appeal to the different teenage habits of the day include Kiki drinking hot chocolate instead of coffee and referring to \"cute boys\" instead of to \"the disco\".[55]\n\n\nHowever, when Disney re-released the film on DVD in 2010, several elements of the English dub were changed, reverting more towards the original Japanese version. Hartman's ad-libbed lines as Jiji were removed, and Forest's opening and ending songs were replaced with Arai's original Japanese opening and ending songs.[56] Additionally, Jiji does not talk again at the end, implying that Kiki never regains the ability to talk to him, and many of the sound effects added to the original English version have been removed. The English subtitled script used for the original VHS subbed release and the later DVD release more closely adheres to the Japanese script, but still contains a few alterations. Tokuma mistakenly believed the Streamline dub was an accurate translation of the film and offered it to Disney to use as subtitles. As a result, several additions from the dub appear in the subtitles regardless of whether or not they are present in the film.[21]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nAt the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 98% of 43 reviews are positive for *Kiki's Delivery Service*, and the average rating is 8.1/10. The critics consensus reads, \"*Kiki's Delivery Service* is a heartwarming, gorgeously-rendered tale of a young witch discovering her place in the world.\"[57] Metacritic, another aggregator, collected 15 reviews and calculated an average rating of 85 out of 100, signifying \"universal acclaim\".[58] On September 4, 1998, *Entertainment Weekly* rated it as Video of the Year, and on September 12, 1998, it was the first video release to be reviewed as a normal film on *Siskel and Ebert* rather than on the \"Video Pick of the Week\" section.[43] Gene Siskel of the *Chicago Tribune* and Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave it \"two thumbs up\"[59][60] and Ebert went on to rank it as one of the best animated films released in the U.S. in 1998.[61] The film ranked #12 on *Wizard's Anime* Magazine's list of the \"Top 50 Anime released in North America\".[62] Other reviews were very positive as well. Andrew Johnston wrote in Time Out New York: \"Although the story has a clear moral about learning to develop self-confidence, *Kiki* is never preachy. The story is given time to unfold at a natural pace..., which contributes greatly to the sense of depth it conveys.\"[63]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Category\n | Result\n | Recipient\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 12th Anime Grand Prix | Best Anime\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | [64] |\n| Best Female Character\n | Won\n | Kiki\n |\n| Best Anime Theme Song\n | Won\n | \"*Yasashisa ni Tsutsumaretanara*\"\n |\n| 44th Mainichi Film Award | *Best Animated Film* | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | [65] |\n| Kinema Junpo Awards | Readers' Choice Award\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | [66] |\n| 13th Japan Academy Prize | Special Award\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | [67] |\n| Popularity Award\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* |\n| 7th Annual Golden Gross Award\n | Gold, Japanese Film\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | [68] |\n| 7th Annual Money Making Director's Award\n | Best Director\n | Won\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n |\n| The Movie's Day\n | Special Achievement Award\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* |\n| The Erandole Award\n | Special Award\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* |\n| Japan Cinema Association Award\n | Best Film\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* |\n| Best Director\n | Won\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n |\n| Agency of Cultural Affairs | Best Film\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* |\n| Tokyo Metropolitan Cultural Honor\n | Best Film\n | Won\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* |\n\n\n## Other media[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\nA four-volume ani-manga book series using stills from the film was published in Japan by Tokuma Shoten between August and September of 1989.[69][70] An English translation would later be published by Viz Media between April and July 2006.[71][72][73][74] Tokuma also published a 208-page art book on February 11, 1989, and Viz Media published the English translation of it on May 9, 2006.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Musicals[edit]\n\n\nA musical based on the film ran at the Southwark Playhouse in the UK from December 8, 2016 to January 7, 2017, and officially opened on December 13, 2016.

The first ran in Tokyo and Osaka from June 2017 to September 2017, and starred Moka Kamishirasi as Kiki and Aran Abe as Tombo. A second one ran in 2018 which starred Riko Fukumoto as Kiki. The most recent one ran from March 2021 to April 2021 in Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka. It stars Neo Inoue as Kiki, and Yūto Nasu as Tombo.[79]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** This value is based on adding the box office revenue of the film's original release in Japan (US$31 million), the 1990 Hong Kong release (US$519,000), and the various re-releases between 2004 and 2023 (US$10,366,082).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Nausicaa.net The Hayao MIYAZAKI Web.
