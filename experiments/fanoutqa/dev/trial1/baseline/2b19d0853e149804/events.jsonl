A 2013 Cochrane review found that it was unclear if mammographic screening does more harm than good, in that a large proportion of women who test positive turn out not to have the disease.[10] A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age,[11] and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years of age.[12] The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it.[2] Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventive measure in some high risk women.[2] In those who have been diagnosed with cancer, a number of treatments may be used, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and targeted therapy.[1] Types of surgery vary from breast-conserving surgery to mastectomy.[13][14] Breast reconstruction may take place at the time of surgery or at a later date.[14] In those in whom the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, treatments are mostly aimed at improving quality of life and comfort.[14]\n\n\nOutcomes for breast cancer vary depending on the cancer type, the extent of disease, and the person's age.[14] The five-year survival rates in England and the United States are between 80 and 90%.[15][4][5] In developing countries, five-year survival rates are lower.[2] Worldwide, breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women, accounting for 25% of all cases.[16] In 2018, it resulted in 2 million new cases and 627,000 deaths.[17] It is more common in developed countries[2] and is more than 100 times more common in women than in men.[15][18]\n\n\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Breast cancer showing an inverted nipple, lump, and skin dimpling\n![](image)Early signs of possible breast cancer\nBreast cancer most commonly presents as a lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of cases are discovered when a person detects such a lump with the fingertips.[19] The earliest breast cancers, however, are detected by a mammogram.[20][21] Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits[19] may also indicate breast cancer.\n\n\nIndications of breast cancer other than a lump may include thickening different from the other breast tissue, one breast becoming larger or lower, a nipple changing position or shape or becoming inverted, skin puckering or dimpling, a rash on or around a nipple, discharge from nipple/s, constant pain in part of the breast or armpit and swelling beneath the armpit or around the collarbone.[22] Pain (\"mastodynia\") is an unreliable tool in determining the presence or absence of breast cancer, but may be indicative of other breast health issues.[19][20][23]\n\n\nAnother symptom complex of breast cancer is Paget's disease of the breast. This syndrome presents as skin changes resembling eczema; such as redness, discoloration or mild flaking of the nipple skin. As Paget's disease of the breast advances, symptoms may include tingling, itching, increased sensitivity, burning, and pain. There may also be discharge from the nipple. Approximately half the women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the breast also have a lump in the breast.[24][25]\n\n\nInflammatory breast cancer is a rare (only seen in less than 5% of breast cancer diagnosis) yet aggressive form of breast cancer characterized by the swollen, red areas formed on the top of the breast. The visual effects of inflammatory breast cancer is a result of a blockage of lymph vessels by cancer cells. This type of breast cancer is seen in more commonly diagnosed in younger ages, obese women and African American women. As inflammatory breast cancer does not present as a lump there can sometimes be a delay in diagnosis.[26]\n\n\nMammary secretory carcinoma (MSC) is a rare form of the secretory carcinomas that occurs exclusively in the breast.[27] It usually develops in adults but in a significant percentage of cases also affects children:[28] MSC accounts for 80% of all childhood breast cancers.[29] MSC lesions are typically slow growing, painless, small ductal breast tumours that have invaded the tissue around their ducts of origin, often spread to sentinel lymph nodes and/or axillary lymph nodes, but rarely metastasized to distant tissues.[30] These tumours typically have distinctive microscopic features and tumour cells that carry a balanced genetic translocation in which part of the *NTRK3* gene is fused to part of the *ETV6* gene[31] to form a fusion gene, *ETV6-NTRK3*. This fusion gene encodes a chimeric protein termed ETV6-NTRK3. The NTRK3 part of ETV6-NTRK3 protein has up-regulated tyrosine kinase activity that stimulates two signaling pathways, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways, which promote cell proliferation and survival and thereby may contribute to the development of MSC.[28] Conservative surgery, modified radical mastectomy, and radical mastectomy have been the most frequent procedures used to treat adults, while simple mastectomy, local excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy, and complete axillary dissection have been recommended to treat children with MSC.[32] In all cases, long-term, e.g. >20 years, follow-up examinations are recommended.[27][31] The relatively rare cases of MSC that have metastasized to distant tissues have shown little or no responses to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Three patients with metastatic disease had good partial responses to Entrectinib, a drug that inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion protein.[33] Because of its slow growth and low rate of metastasis to distant tissues, individuals with MSC have had 20 year survival rates of 93.16%.[27]\n\n\nIn rare cases, what initially appears as a fibroadenoma (hard, movable non-cancerous lump) could in fact be a phyllodes tumour. Phyllodes tumours are formed within the stroma (connective tissue) of the breast and contain glandular as well as stromal tissue. Phyllodes tumours are not staged in the usual sense; they are classified on the basis of their appearance under the microscope as benign, borderline or malignant.[34]\n\n\nMalignant tumours can result in metastatic tumours – secondary tumours (originating from the primary tumour) that spread beyond the site of origination. The symptoms caused by metastatic breast cancer will depend on the location of metastasis. Common sites of metastasis include bone, liver, lung, and brain.[35] When cancer has reached such an invasive state, it is categorized as a stage 4 cancer, cancers of this state are often fatal.[36] Common symptoms of stage 4 cancer include unexplained weight loss, bone and joint pain, jaundice and neurological symptoms. These symptoms are called non-specific symptoms because they could be manifestations of many other illnesses.[37] Rarely breast cancer can spread to exceedingly uncommon sites such as peripancreatic lymph nodes causing biliary obstruction leading to diagnostic difficulties.[38]\n\n\n\n![Tumor in the breast visualized by Breast-CT](image)Tumour in the breast visualized by Breast-Computertomography (Breast-CT)\nMost symptoms of breast disorders, including most lumps, do not turn out to represent underlying breast cancer. Less than 20% of lumps, for example, are cancerous,[39] and benign breast diseases such as mastitis and fibroadenoma of the breast are more common causes of breast disorder symptoms.[40]\n\n\n\n## Risk factors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Risk factors of breast cancer\n\nRisk factors can be divided into two categories:\n\n\n\n* *modifiable* risk factors (things that people can change themselves, such as consumption of alcoholic beverages), and\n* *fixed* risk factors (things that cannot be changed, such as age and biological sex).[41]\n\n\nThe primary risk factors for breast cancer are being female and older age.[42] Most breast cancers develop in women over 50. Women in their early 50s are twice as more likely to develop breast cancer than women in their early 40s.[43]\n\n\nOther potential risk factors include genetics,[44] lack of childbearing or lack of breastfeeding,[45] higher levels of certain hormones,[46][47] certain dietary patterns, and obesity. Exposure to artificial light during sleeping might also be risk factor for the development of breast cancer.[48]\n\n\nActions to prevent breast cancer include not drinking alcoholic beverages, maintaining a healthy body composition, avoiding smoking and eating healthy food. Combining all of these (leading the healthiest possible lifestyle) would make almost a quarter of breast cancer cases worldwide preventable.[49] The remaining three-quarters of breast cancer cases cannot be prevented through lifestyle changes.[49]\n\n\n\n### Lifestyle[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Alcohol and breast cancer and List of breast carcinogenic substances\n\n![Diagram of different sizes, showing how big a single serving of alcohol is for different types of alcoholic beverages](image)All types of alcoholic beverages, including beer, wine, or liquor, cause breast cancer.\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\nDrinking alcohol, even at low levels, increases the risk of breast cancer  \nAdditional risk from drinking[50][51]\n\nOriginal breast cancer risk (=100%)\n\nDrinking alcoholic beverages increases the risk of breast cancer, even among very light drinkers (women drinking less than half of one alcoholic drink per day).[50] The risk is highest among heavy drinkers.[52] Globally, about one in 10 cases of breast cancer is caused by women drinking alcoholic beverages.[52] Drinking alcoholic beverages is among the most common modifiable risk factors.[53]\n\n\nObesity and diabetes increase the risk of breast cancer. A high body mass index (BMI) causes 7% of breast cancers while diabetes is responsible for 2%.[43][54] At the same time the correlation between obesity and breast cancer is anything but linear. Studies show that those who rapidly gain weight in adulthood are at higher risk than those who have been overweight since childhood. Likewise excess fat in the midsection seems to induce a higher risk than excess weight carried in the lower body.[55] Dietary factors that may increase risk include a high-fat diet[56] and obesity-related high cholesterol levels.[57][58]\n\n\nDietary iodine deficiency may also play a role in the development of breast cancer.[59]\n\n\nSmoking tobacco appears to increase the risk of breast cancer, with the greater the amount smoked and the earlier in life that smoking began, the higher the risk.[60] In those who are long-term smokers, the relative risk is increased 35% to 50%.[60]\n\n\nA lack of physical activity has been linked to about 10% of cases.[61] Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from breast cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.[62]\n\n\nBreast feeding reduces the risk of several types of cancers, including breast cancer.[63][64][65][66] In the 1980s, the abortion–breast cancer hypothesis posited that induced abortion increased the risk of developing breast cancer.[67] This hypothesis was the subject of extensive scientific inquiry, which concluded that neither miscarriages nor abortions are associated with a heightened risk for breast cancer.[68]\n\n\nOther risk factors include radiation[69] and circadian disruptions related to shift-work[70] and routine late-night eating.[71] A number of chemicals have also been linked, including polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and organic solvents[72] Although the radiation from mammography is a low dose, it is estimated that yearly screening from 40 to 80 years of age will cause approximately 225 cases of fatal breast cancer per million women screened.[73]\n\n\n\n### Hormone therapy and hormonal contraception[edit]\n\n\nIn general, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to treat menopause is associated with only a small increased risk of breast cancer.[74][75][76] The level of risk also depends on the type of HRT, the duration of the treatment and the age of the person. Oestrogen-only HRT, taken by people who had a hysterectomy, comes with an extremely low level of breast cancer risk. The most commonly taken combined HRT (oestrogen and progestogen) is linked to a small risk of breast cancer. This risk is lower for women in their 50s and higher for older women. The risk increases with the duration of HRT. When HRT is taken for a year or less, there is no increased risk of breast cancer. HRT taken for more than 5 years comes with an increased risk but the risk reduces after the therapy is stopped.[75][76]\n\n\nThe use of hormonal birth control does not cause breast cancer for most women;[77] if it has an effect, it is small (on the order of 0.01% per user–year; comparable to the rate of maternal mortality in the United States[78]), temporary, and offset by the users' significantly reduced risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers.[78] Among those with a family history of breast cancer, use of modern oral contraceptives does not appear to affect the risk of breast cancer.[79] It is less certain whether hormonal contraceptives could increase the already high rates of breast cancer in women with mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes *BRCA1* or *BRCA2*.[80]\n\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nGenetics is believed to be the primary cause of 5–10% of all cases.[81] Women whose mother was diagnosed before 50 have an increased risk of 1.7 and those whose mother was diagnosed at age 50 or after has an increased risk of 1.4.[82] In those with zero, one or two affected relatives, the risk of breast cancer before the age of 80 is 7.8%, 13.3%, and 21.1% with a subsequent mortality from the disease of 2.3%, 4.2%, and 7.6% respectively.[83] In those with a first degree relative with the disease the risk of breast cancer between the age of 40 and 50 is double that of the general population.[84]\n\n\nIn less than 5% of cases, genetics plays a more significant role by causing a hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome.[85] This includes those who carry the *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* gene mutation.[85] These mutations account for up to 90% of the total genetic influence with a risk of breast cancer of 60–80% in those affected.[81] Other significant mutations include *p53* (Li–Fraumeni syndrome), *PTEN* (Cowden syndrome), and *STK11* (Peutz–Jeghers syndrome), *CHEK2*, *ATM*, *BRIP1*, and *PALB2*.[81] In 2012, researchers said that there are four genetically distinct types of the breast cancer and that in each type, hallmark genetic changes lead to many cancers.[86]\n\n\nOther genetic predispositions include the density of the breast tissue and hormonal levels. Women with dense breast tissue are more likely to get tumours and are less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer – because the dense tissue makes tumours less visible on mammograms. Furthermore, women with naturally high estrogen and progesterone levels are also at higher risk for tumour development.[87][88]\n\n\n\n### Medical conditions[edit]\n\n\nBreast changes like atypical ductal hyperplasia[89] and lobular carcinoma *in situ*,[90][91] found in benign breast conditions such as fibrocystic breast changes, are correlated with an increased breast cancer risk.\n\n\nDiabetes mellitus might also increase the risk of breast cancer.[92] Autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus seem also to increase the risk for the acquisition of breast cancer.[93]\n\n\nThe major causes of sporadic breast cancer are associated with hormone levels. Breast cancer is promoted by estrogen. This hormone activates the development of breast throughout puberty, menstrual cycles and pregnancy. The imbalance between estrogen and progesterone during the menstrual phases causes cell proliferation. Moreover, oxidative metabolites of estrogen can increase DNA damage and mutations. Repeated cycling and the impairment of repair process can transform a normal cell into pre-malignant and eventually malignant cell through mutation. During the premalignant stage, high proliferation of stromal cells can be activated by estrogen to support the development of breast cancer. During the ligand binding activation, the ER can regulate gene expression by interacting with estrogen response elements within the promotor of specific genes. The expression and activation of ER due to lack of estrogen can be stimulated by extracellular signals.[94] Interestingly, the ER directly binding with the several proteins, including growth factor receptors, can promote the expression of genes related to cell growth and survival.[95]\n\n\nRaised prolactin levels in the blood are associated with increased risk of breast cancer.[96] A meta-analysis of observational research with over two million individuals has suggested a moderate association of antipsychotic use with breast cancer, possibly mediated by prolactin-inducing properties of specific agents.[97]\n\n\n\n## Pathophysiology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Carcinogenesis\n\n![](image)Ducts and lobules, the main locations of breast cancers\n![](image)Overview of signal transduction pathways involved in programmed cell death. Mutations leading to loss of this ability can lead to cancer formation.\nBreast cancer, like other cancers, occurs because of an interaction between an environmental (external) factor and a genetically susceptible host. Normal cells divide as many times as needed and stop. They attach to other cells and stay in place in tissues. Cells become cancerous when they lose their ability to stop dividing, to attach to other cells, to stay where they belong, and to die at the proper time.\n\n\nNormal cells will self-destruct (programmed cell death) when they are no longer needed. Until then, cells are protected from programmed death by several protein clusters and pathways. One of the protective pathways is the PI3K/AKT pathway; another is the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway. Sometimes the genes along these protective pathways are mutated in a way that turns them permanently \"on\", rendering the cell incapable of self-destructing when it is no longer needed. This is one of the steps that causes cancer in combination with other mutations. Normally, the PTEN protein turns off the PI3K/AKT pathway when the cell is ready for programmed cell death. In some breast cancers, the gene for the PTEN protein is mutated, so the PI3K/AKT pathway is stuck in the \"on\" position, and the cancer cell does not self-destruct.[98]\n\n\nMutations that can lead to breast cancer have been experimentally linked to estrogen exposure.[99] Additionally, G-protein coupled estrogen receptors have been associated with various cancers of the female reproductive system including breast cancer.[100]\n\n\nAbnormal growth factor signaling in the interaction between stromal cells and epithelial cells can facilitate malignant cell growth.[101][102] In breast adipose tissue, overexpression of leptin leads to increased cell proliferation and cancer.[103]\n\n\nIn the United States, 10 to 20 percent of women with breast cancer or ovarian cancer have a first- or second-degree relative with one of these diseases. Men with breast cancer have an even higher likelihood. The familial tendency to develop these cancers is called hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome. The best known of these, the *BRCA* mutations, confer a lifetime risk of breast cancer of between 60 and 85 percent and a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of between 15 and 40 percent. Some mutations associated with cancer, such as *p53*, *BRCA1* and *BRCA2*, occur in mechanisms to correct errors in DNA. These mutations are either inherited or acquired after birth. Presumably, they allow further mutations, which allow uncontrolled division, lack of attachment, and metastasis to distant organs.[69][104] However, there is strong evidence of residual risk variation that goes well beyond hereditary *BRCA* gene mutations between carrier families. This is caused by unobserved risk factors.[105] This implicates environmental and other causes as triggers for breast cancers. The inherited mutation in *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* genes can interfere with repair of DNA cross links and DNA double strand breaks (known functions of the encoded protein).[106] These carcinogens cause DNA damage such as DNA cross links and double strand breaks that often require repairs by pathways containing BRCA1 and BRCA2.[107][108] However, mutations in *BRCA* genes account for only 2 to 3 percent of all breast cancers.[109] Levin *et al.* say that cancer may not be inevitable for all carriers of *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* mutations.[110] About half of hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndromes involve unknown genes. Furthermore, certain latent viruses, may decrease the expression of the *BRCA1* gene and increase the risk of breast tumours.[111]\n\n\nGATA-3 directly controls the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and other genes associated with epithelial differentiation, and the loss of GATA-3 leads to loss of differentiation and poor prognosis due to cancer cell invasion and metastasis.[112]\n\n\n\n## Diagnosis[edit]\n\n\nMost types of breast cancer are easy to diagnose by microscopic analysis of a sample – or biopsy – of the affected area of the breast. Also, there are types of breast cancer that require specialized lab exams.\n\n\nThe two most commonly used screening methods, physical examination of the breasts by a healthcare provider and mammography, can offer an approximate likelihood that a lump is cancer, and may also detect some other lesions, such as a simple cyst.[113] When these examinations are inconclusive, a healthcare provider can remove a sample of the fluid in the lump for microscopic analysis (a procedure known as fine needle aspiration, or fine needle aspiration and cytology, FNAC) to help establish the diagnosis. A needle aspiration can be performed in a healthcare provider's office or clinic. A local anesthetic may be used to numb the breast tissue to prevent pain during the procedure, but may not be necessary if the lump is not beneath the skin. A finding of clear fluid makes the lump highly unlikely to be cancerous, but bloody fluid may be sent off for inspection under a microscope for cancerous cells. Together, physical examination of the breasts, mammography, and FNAC can be used to diagnose breast cancer with a good degree of accuracy.\n\n\nOther options for biopsy include a core biopsy or vacuum-assisted breast biopsy,[114] which are procedures in which a section of the breast lump is removed; or an excisional biopsy, in which the entire lump is removed. Very often the results of physical examination by a healthcare provider, mammography, and additional tests that may be performed in special circumstances (such as imaging by ultrasound or MRI) are sufficient to warrant excisional biopsy as the definitive diagnostic and primary treatment method.[115][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)**Breast cancer cell**\n* ![MRI showing breast cancer](image)\n\nMRI showing breast cancer\n* ![Excised human breast tissue, showing an irregular, dense, white stellate area of cancer 2 cm in diameter, within yellow fatty tissue](image)\n\nExcised human breast tissue, showing an irregular, dense, white stellate area of cancer 2 cm in diameter, within yellow fatty tissue\n* ![High-grade invasive ductal carcinoma, with minimal tubule formation, marked pleomorphism, and prominent mitoses, 40x field](image)\n\nHigh-grade invasive ductal carcinoma, with minimal tubule formation, marked pleomorphism, and prominent mitoses, 40x field\n* ![Micrograph showing a lymph node invaded by ductal breast carcinoma, with an extension of the tumor beyond the lymph node](image)\n\nMicrograph showing a lymph node invaded by ductal breast carcinoma, with an extension of the tumor beyond the lymph node\n* ![Neuropilin-2 expression in normal breast and breast carcinoma tissue](image)\n\nNeuropilin-2 expression in normal breast and breast carcinoma tissue\n* ![F-18 FDG PET/CT: A breast cancer metastasis to the right scapula](image)\n\nF-18 FDG PET/CT: A breast cancer metastasis to the right scapula\n* ![Needle breast biopsy](image)\n\nNeedle breast biopsy\n* ![Elastography shows stiff cancer tissue on ultrasound imaging.](image)\n\nElastography shows stiff cancer tissue on ultrasound imaging.\n* ![Ultrasound image shows irregularly shaped mass of breast cancer.](image)\n\nUltrasound image shows irregularly shaped mass of breast cancer.\n* ![Infiltrating (invasive) breast carcinoma](image)\n\nInfiltrating (invasive) breast carcinoma\n* ![Mammograms showing a normal breast (left) and a breast with cancer (right)](image)\n\nMammograms showing a normal breast (left) and a breast with cancer (right)\n\n\n### Classification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Breast cancer classification\n\nBreast cancers are classified by several grading systems. Each of these influences the prognosis and can affect treatment response. Description of a breast cancer optimally includes all of these factors.\n\n\n\n![](image)Histopathologic types of breast cancer, with relative incidences and prognoses\n* **Histopathology**. Breast cancer is usually classified primarily by its histological appearance. Most breast cancers are derived from the epithelium lining the ducts or lobules, and these cancers are classified as ductal or lobular carcinoma. *Carcinoma in situ* is growth of low-grade cancerous or precancerous cells within a particular tissue compartment such as the mammary duct without invasion of the surrounding tissue. In contrast, *invasive carcinoma* does not confine itself to the initial tissue compartment.[116]\n* **Grade**. Grading compares the appearance of the breast cancer cells to the appearance of normal breast tissue. Normal cells in an organ like the breast become differentiated, meaning that they take on specific shapes and forms that reflect their function as part of that organ. Cancerous cells lose that differentiation. In cancer, the cells that would normally line up in an orderly way to make up the milk ducts become disorganized. Cell division becomes uncontrolled. Cell nuclei become less uniform. Pathologists describe cells as well differentiated (low grade), moderately differentiated (intermediate grade), and poorly differentiated (high grade) as the cells progressively lose the features seen in normal breast cells. Poorly differentiated cancers (the ones whose tissue is least like normal breast tissue) have a worse prognosis.\n* **Stage**. Breast cancer staging using the TNM system is based on the size of the tumour (**T**), whether or not the tumour has spread to the lymph nodes (**N**) in the armpits, and whether the tumour has metastasized (**M**) (i.e. spread to a more distant part of the body). Larger size, nodal spread, and metastasis have a larger stage number and a worse prognosis.   \nThe main stages are:\n\t+ Stage 0 is a pre-cancerous or marker condition, either ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).\n\t+ Stages 1–3 are within the breast or regional lymph nodes.\n\t+ Stage 4 is 'metastatic' cancer that has a less favorable prognosis since it has spread beyond the breast and regional lymph nodes.\n\n\n* ![Stage T1 breast cancer](image)\n\nStage T1 breast cancer\n* ![Stage T2 breast cancer](image)\n\nStage T2 breast cancer\n* ![Stage T3 breast cancer](image)\n\nStage T3 breast cancer\n* ![Metastatic or stage 4 breast cancer](image)\n\nMetastatic or stage 4 breast cancer\n\n\nWhere available, imaging studies may be employed as part of the staging process in select cases to look for signs of metastatic cancer. However, in cases of breast cancer with low risk for metastasis, the risks associated with PET scans, CT scans, or bone scans outweigh the possible benefits, as these procedures expose the person to a substantial amount of potentially dangerous ionizing radiation.[117][118]\n* **Receptor status**. Breast cancer cells have receptors on their surface and in their cytoplasm and nucleus. Chemical messengers such as hormones bind to receptors, and this causes changes in the cell. Breast cancer cells may or may not have three important receptors: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2.   \nER+ cancer cells (that is, cancer cells that have estrogen receptors) depend on estrogen for their growth, so they can be treated with drugs to block estrogen effects (e.g. tamoxifen), and generally have a better prognosis. Untreated, HER2+ breast cancers are generally more aggressive than HER2- breast cancers,[119][120] but HER2+ cancer cells respond to drugs such as the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (in combination with conventional chemotherapy), and this has improved the prognosis significantly.[121] Cells that do not have any of these three receptor types (estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or HER2) are called triple-negative, although they frequently do express receptors for other hormones, such as androgen receptor and prolactin receptor.\n* **DNA assays**. DNA testing of various types including DNA microarrays have compared normal cells to breast cancer cells. The specific changes in a particular breast cancer can be used to classify the cancer in several ways, and may assist in choosing the most effective treatment for that DNA type.\n\n\n* ![Stage 1A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 1A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 1B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 1B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 4 breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 4 breast cancer\n\n\n## Screening[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Breast cancer screening\n\n![](image)A mobile breast cancer screening unit in New Zealand\nBreast cancer screening refers to testing otherwise-healthy women for breast cancer in an attempt to achieve an earlier diagnosis under the assumption that early detection will improve outcomes. A number of screening tests have been employed including clinical and self breast exams, mammography, genetic screening, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n\nA clinical or self breast exam involves feeling the breast for lumps or other abnormalities. Clinical breast exams are performed by health care providers, while self-breast exams are performed by the person themselves.[122] Evidence does not support the effectiveness of either type of breast exam, as by the time a lump is large enough to be found it is likely to have been growing for several years and thus soon be large enough to be found without an exam.[123][124] Mammographic screening for breast cancer uses X-rays to examine the breast for any uncharacteristic masses or lumps. During a screening, the breast is compressed and a technician takes photos from multiple angles. A general mammogram takes photos of the entire breast, while a diagnostic mammogram focuses on a specific lump or area of concern.[125]\n\n\nA number of national bodies recommend breast cancer screening. For the average woman, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and American College of Physicians recommends mammography every two years in women between the ages of 50 and 74,[12][126] the Council of Europe recommends mammography between 50 and 69 with most programs using a 2-year frequency,[127] while the European Commission recommends mammography from 45 to 75 every 2 to 3 years,[128] and in Canada screening is recommended between the ages of 50 and 74 at a frequency of 2 to 3 years.[129] The American Cancer Society also endorses that women ages 40 and older receive mammograms annually.[130] These task force reports point out that in addition to unnecessary surgery and anxiety, the risks of more frequent mammograms include a small but significant increase in breast cancer induced by radiation.[131]\n\n\nThe Cochrane collaboration (2013) states that the best quality evidence neither demonstrates a reduction in cancer specific, nor a reduction in all cause mortality from screening mammography.[10] When less rigorous trials are added to the analysis there is a reduction in mortality due to breast cancer of 0.05% (a decrease of 1 in 2000 deaths from breast cancer over 10 years or a relative decrease of 15% from breast cancer).[10] Screening over 10 years results in a 30% increase in rates of over-diagnosis and over-treatment (3 to 14 per 1000) and more than half will have at least one falsely positive test.[10][132] This has resulted in the view that it is not clear whether mammography screening does more good or harm.[10] Cochrane states that, due to recent improvements in breast cancer treatment, and the risks of false positives from breast cancer screening leading to unnecessary treatment, \"it therefore no longer seems beneficial to attend for breast cancer screening\" at any age.[133] Whether MRI as a screening method has greater harms or benefits when compared to standard mammography is not known.[134][135]\n\n\n\n## Prevention[edit]\n\n\n### Lifestyle[edit]\n\n\nWomen can reduce their risk of breast cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol use, increasing physical activity, and breast-feeding.[136] These modifications might prevent 38% of breast cancers in the US, 42% in the UK, 28% in Brazil, and 20% in China.[136] The benefits with moderate exercise such as brisk walking are seen at all age groups including postmenopausal women.[136][137] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer by about 14%.[138] Strategies that encourage regular physical activity and reduce obesity could also have other benefits, such as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[41] A study that included data from 130,957 women of European ancestry found \"strong evidence that greater levels of physical activity and less sedentary time are likely to reduce breast cancer risk, with results generally consistent across breast cancer subtypes\".[139]\n\n\nThe American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology advised in 2016 that people should eat a diet high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes.[140] Eating foods rich in soluble fiber contributes to reducing breast cancer risk.[141][142] High intake of citrus fruit has been associated with a 10% reduction in the risk of breast cancer.[143] Marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids appear to reduce the risk.[144] High consumption of soy-based foods may reduce risk.[145]\n\n\n\n### Pre-emptive surgery[edit]\n\n\nRemoval of both breasts before any cancer has been diagnosed or any suspicious lump or other lesion has appeared (a procedure known as \"prophylactic bilateral mastectomy\" or \"risk reducing mastectomy\") may be considered in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, which are associated with a substantially heightened risk for an eventual diagnosis of breast cancer.[146][147] Evidence is not strong enough to support this procedure in anyone but women at the highest risk.[148] BRCA testing is recommended in those with a high family risk after genetic counseling. It is not recommended routinely.[149] This is because there are many forms of changes in BRCA genes, ranging from harmless polymorphisms to obviously dangerous frameshift mutations.[149] The effect of most of the identifiable changes in the genes is uncertain. Testing in an average-risk person is particularly likely to return one of these indeterminate, useless results. Removing the second breast in a person who has breast cancer (contralateral risk‐reducing mastectomy or CRRM) may reduce the risk of cancer in the second breast, however, it is unclear if removing the second breast in those who have breast cancer improves survival.[148] An increasing number women who test positive for faulty BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes choose to have risk-reducing surgery. At the same time the average waiting time for undergoing the procedure is two-years which is much longer than recommended.[150][151]\n\n\n\n### Medications[edit]\n\n\nThe selective estrogen receptor modulators reduce the risk of breast cancer but increase the risk of thromboembolism and endometrial cancer.[152] There is no overall change in the risk of death.[152][153] They are thus not recommended for the prevention of breast cancer in women at average risk but it is recommended they be offered for those at high risk and over the age of 35.[154] The benefit of breast cancer reduction continues for at least five years after stopping a course of treatment with these medications.[155] Aromatase inhibitors (such as exemestane and anastrozole) may be more effective than selective estrogen receptor modulators (such as tamoxifen) at reducing breast cancer risk and they are not associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism.[156]\n\n\n\n## Management[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Breast cancer management\n\nThe management of breast cancer depends on various factors, including the stage of the cancer and the person's age. Treatments are more aggressive when the cancer is more advanced or there is a higher risk of recurrence of the cancer following treatment.\n\n\nBreast cancer is usually treated with surgery, which may be followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both. A multidisciplinary approach is preferable.[157] Hormone receptor-positive cancers are often treated with hormone-blocking therapy over courses of several years. Monoclonal antibodies, or other immune-modulating treatments, may be administered in certain cases of metastatic and other advanced stages of breast cancer, although this range of treatment is still being studied.[158]\n\n\n\n### Surgery[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cancer Diagnostic Probe\n\n![](image)Chest after right breast mastectomy\nSurgery involves the physical removal of the tumour, typically along with some of the surrounding tissue. One or more lymph nodes may be biopsied during the surgery; increasingly the lymph node sampling is performed by a sentinel lymph node biopsy.\n\n\nStandard surgeries include:\n\n\n\n* Mastectomy: Removal of the whole breast.\n* Quadrantectomy: Removal of one-quarter of the breast.\n* Lumpectomy: Removal of a small part of the breast.\n\n\nOnce the tumour has been removed, if the person desires, breast reconstruction surgery, a type of plastic surgery, may then be performed to improve the aesthetic appearance of the treated site.\nAlternatively, women use breast prostheses to simulate a breast under clothing, or choose a flat chest. Nipple prosthesis can be used at any time following the mastectomy.\n\n\n\n### Medication[edit]\n\n\nMedications used after and in addition to surgery are called adjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy or other types of therapy prior to surgery are called neoadjuvant therapy. Aspirin may reduce mortality from breast cancer when used with other treatments.[159][160]\n\n\nThere are currently three main groups of medications used for adjuvant breast cancer treatment: hormone-blocking agents, chemotherapy, and monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n\n#### Hormonal therapy[edit]\n\n\nSome breast cancers require estrogen to continue growing. They can be identified by the presence of estrogen receptors (ER+) and progesterone receptors (PR+) on their surface (sometimes referred to together as hormone receptors). These ER+ cancers can be treated with drugs that either block the receptors, e.g. tamoxifen, or alternatively block the production of estrogen with an aromatase inhibitor, e.g. anastrozole[161] or letrozole. The use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years.[162] Tamoxifen increases the risk of postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial polyps, hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer; using tamoxifen with an intrauterine system releasing levonorgestrel might increase vaginal bleeding after one to two years, but reduces somewhat endometrial polyps and hyperplasia, but not necessarily endometrial cancer.[163] Letrozole is recommended for five years.\n\n\nAromatase inhibitors are only suitable for women after menopause; however, in this group, they appear better than tamoxifen.[164] This is because the active aromatase in postmenopausal women is different from the prevalent form in premenopausal women, and therefore these agents are ineffective in inhibiting the predominant aromatase of premenopausal women.[165] Aromatase inhibitors should not be given to premenopausal women with intact ovarian function (unless they are also on treatment to stop their ovaries from working).[166] CDK inhibitors can be used in combination with endocrine or aromatase therapy.[167]\n\n\n\n#### Chemotherapy[edit]\n\n\nChemotherapy is predominantly used for cases of breast cancer in stages 2–4, and is particularly beneficial in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) disease. The chemotherapy medications are administered in combinations, usually for periods of 3–6 months. One of the most common regimens, known as \"AC\", combines cyclophosphamide with doxorubicin. Sometimes a taxane drug, such as docetaxel, is added, and the regime is then known as \"CAT\". Another common treatment is cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (or \"CMF\"). Most chemotherapy medications work by destroying fast-growing and/or fast-replicating cancer cells, either by causing DNA damage upon replication or by other mechanisms. However, the medications also damage fast-growing normal cells, which may cause serious side effects. Damage to the heart muscle is the most dangerous complication of doxorubicin, for example.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Monoclonal antibodies[edit]\n\n\nTrastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody to HER2, has improved the five-year disease free survival of stage 1–3 HER2-positive breast cancers to about 87% (overall survival 95%).[168] Between 25% and 30% of breast cancers overexpress the HER2 gene or its protein product,[169] and overexpression of HER2 in breast cancer is associated with increased disease recurrence and worse prognosis. Trastuzumab, however, is very expensive, and its use may cause serious side effects (approximately 2% of people who receive it develop significant heart damage).[170] Another antibody pertuzumab prevents HER2 dimerization and is recommended together with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in severe disease.[171][172]\n\n\n\n#### Targeted therapy[edit]\n\n\nElacestrant (Orserdu) was approved for medical use in the United States in January 2023.[173][174]\n\n\nCapivasertib (Truqap) was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2023.[175][176][177]\n\n\n\n### Radiation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Internal radiotherapy for breast cancer\nRadiotherapy is given after surgery to the region of the tumour bed and regional lymph nodes, to destroy microscopic tumour cells that may have escaped surgery. When given intraoperatively as targeted intraoperative radiotherapy, it may also have a beneficial effect on tumour microenvironment.[178][179] Radiation therapy can be delivered as external beam radiotherapy or as brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy). Conventionally radiotherapy is given *after* the operation for breast cancer. Radiation can also be given at the time of operation on the breast cancer. Radiation can reduce the risk of recurrence by 50–66% (1/2 – 2/3 reduction of risk) when delivered in the correct dose[180] and is considered essential when breast cancer is treated by removing only the lump (Lumpectomy or Wide local excision). In early breast cancer, partial breast irradiation does not give the same cancer control in the breast as treating the whole breast and may cause worse side effects.[181]\n\n\n\n### Follow-up care[edit]\n\n\nCare after primary breast cancer treatment, otherwise called 'follow-up care', can be intensive involving regular laboratory tests in asymptomatic people to try to achieve earlier detection of possible metastases. A review has found that follow-up programs involving regular physical examinations and yearly mammography alone are as effective as more intensive programs consisting of laboratory tests in terms of early detection of recurrence, overall survival and quality of life.[182]\n\n\nMultidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes, often including exercise, education and psychological help, may produce short-term improvements in functional ability, psychosocial adjustment and social participation in people with breast cancer.[183]\n\n\nUpper limb problems such as shoulder and arm pain, weakness and restricted movement are a common side effect after radiotherapy or breast cancer surgery.[184] According to research in the UK, an exercise programme started 7–10 days after surgery can reduce upper limb problems.[185][186]\n\n\n\n## Prognosis[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Breasts after double mastectomy followed by nipple-sparing reconstruction with implants\n### Prognostic factors[edit]\n\n\n\n\nBreast cancer prognosis by stage[187]\n| Stage | 5-yearsurvival\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Stage I\n | 100%\n |\n| Stage II\n | 90%\n |\n| Stage III\n | 70%\n |\n| Stage IV\n | 30%\n |\n\n\n![](image)An extreme example of an advanced recurrent breast cancer with an ulcerating axillary mass\nThe stage of the breast cancer is the most important component of traditional classification methods of breast cancer, because it has a greater effect on the prognosis than the other considerations. Staging takes into consideration size, local involvement, lymph node status and whether metastatic disease is present. The higher the stage at diagnosis, the poorer the prognosis. The stage is raised by the invasiveness of disease to lymph nodes, chest wall, skin or beyond, and the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. The stage is lowered by the presence of cancer-free zones and close-to-normal cell behaviour (grading). Size is not a factor in staging unless the cancer is invasive. For example, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) involving the entire breast will still be stage zero and consequently an excellent prognosis.\n\n\n\n* Stage 1 cancers (and DCIS, LCIS) have an excellent prognosis and are generally treated with lumpectomy and sometimes radiation.[188]\n* Stage 2 and 3 cancers with a progressively poorer prognosis and greater risk of recurrence are generally treated with surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy with or without lymph node removal), chemotherapy (plus trastuzumab for HER2+ cancers) and sometimes radiation (particularly following large cancers, multiple positive nodes or lumpectomy).[*medical citation needed*]\n* Stage 4, metastatic cancer, (i.e. spread to distant sites) has a poor prognosis and is managed by various combination of all treatments from surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and targeted therapies.\n\n\nThe breast cancer grade is assessed by comparison of the breast cancer cells to normal breast cells. The closer to normal the cancer cells are, the slower their growth and the better the prognosis. If cells are not well differentiated, they will appear immature, will divide more rapidly, and will tend to spread. Well differentiated is given a grade of 1, moderate is grade 2, while poor or undifferentiated is given a higher grade of 3 or 4 (depending upon the scale used). The most widely used grading system is the Nottingham scheme.[189]\n\n\nYounger women with an age of less than 40 years or women over 80 years tend to have a poorer prognosis than post-menopausal women due to several factors. Their breasts may change with their menstrual cycles, they may be nursing infants, and they may be unaware of changes in their breasts. Therefore, younger women are usually at a more advanced stage when diagnosed. There may also be biological factors contributing to a higher risk of disease recurrence for younger women with breast cancer.[190]\n\n\n\n### Psychological aspects[edit]\n\n\nNot all people with breast cancer experience their illness in the same manner. Factors such as age can have a significant impact on the way a person copes with a breast cancer diagnosis. Premenopausal women with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer must confront the issues of early menopause induced by many of the chemotherapy regimens used to treat their breast cancer, especially those that use hormones to counteract ovarian function.[191]\n\n\nIn women with non-metastatic breast cancer, psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy can have positive effects on outcomes such as anxiety, depression and mood disturbance, and can also improve the quality of life.[192] Physical activity interventions may also have beneficial effects on health related quality of life, anxiety, fitness and physical activity in women with breast cancer following adjuvant therapy.[193]\n\n\n\n### Cardiovascular outcomes in breast cancer survivors[edit]\n\n\nWith nearly 3 million BC survivors in the USA,[194] the 5-year survival rate for patients has increased to over 90% thanks to advancements in breast cancer treatment and earlier detection.[195]  Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are becoming more widely acknowledged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality as breast cancer patients live longer.[196]\n\n\nThe recent meta-analysis compared the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in breast cancer patients to the risk in a general matched cancer-free population, and also estimated the incidence of cardiovascular events in BC patients.[197] After analysing data from 26 studies (836,301 patients), the authors found that breast cancer survivors demonstrated a higher risk for cardiovascular death within five years of cancer diagnosis (HR = 1.09; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.11), HF within ten years (HR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.33), and AF within three years (HR = 1.13; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.21).[197]\n\n\nThe epidemiological data from 2,111,882 breast cancer patients revealed that the pooled incidence rates for cardiovascular death was 1.73 (95% CI 1.18, 2.53), 4.44 (95% CI 3.33, 5.92) for heart failure, 4.29 (95% CI 3.09, 5.94) for coronary artery disease, 1.98 (95% CI 1.24, 3.16) for myocardial infarction, 4.33 (95% CI 2.97, 6.30) for stroke of any type, and 2.64 (95% CI 2.97, 6.30) for ischemic stroke per 1000 person-years of follow-up.[197] The study clearly highlighted the crucial need for clinicians to thoroughly examine the cardiovascular risk factor profile of breast cancer survivors and monitor their cardiovascular health.[197]\n\n\n\n## Epidemiology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Epidemiology of breast cancer\n\n![](image)Age-standardized death from breast cancer per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004[198] |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| no data\n <2\n 2–4\n 4–6\n 6–8\n 8–10\n 10–12\n | 12–14\n 14–16\n 16–18\n 18–20\n 20–22\n >22\n |\n\nWorldwide, breast cancer is the most-common invasive cancer in women.[199] Along with lung cancer, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with 2.09 million cases each in 2018.[200] Breast cancer affects 1 in 7 (14%) of women worldwide.[201] (The most common form of cancer is non-invasive non-melanoma skin cancer; non-invasive cancers are generally easily cured, cause very few deaths, and are routinely excluded from cancer statistics.) Breast cancer comprises 22.9% of invasive cancers in women[202] and 16% of all female cancers.[203] In 2012, it comprised 25.2% of cancers diagnosed in women, making it the most-common female cancer.[204]\n\n\nIn 2008, breast cancer caused 458,503 deaths worldwide (13.7% of cancer deaths in women and 6.0% of all cancer deaths for men and women together).[202] Lung cancer, the second most-common cause of cancer-related deaths in women, caused 12.8% of cancer deaths in women (18.2% of all cancer deaths for men and women together).[202]\n\n\nThe incidence of breast cancer varies greatly around the world: it is lowest in less-developed countries and greatest in the more-developed countries. In the twelve world regions, the annual age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 women are as follows: 18 in Eastern Asia, 22 in South Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, 26 in South-Eastern Asia, 26, 28 in North Africa and Western Asia, 42 in South and Central America, 42, 49 in Eastern Europe, 56 in Southern Europe, 73 in Northern Europe, 74 in Oceania, 78 in Western Europe, and 90 in North America.[205] Metastatic breast cancer affects between 19% (United States) and 50% (parts of Africa) of women with breast cancer.[206]\n\n\nThe number of cases worldwide has significantly increased since the 1970s, a phenomenon partly attributed to the modern lifestyles.[207][208] Breast cancer is strongly related to age with only 5% of all breast cancers occurring in women under 40 years old.[209] There were more than 41,000 newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer registered in England in 2011, around 80% of these cases were in women age 50 or older.[210] Based on U.S. statistics in 2015 there were 2.8 million women affected by breast cancer.[199] In the United States, the age-adjusted incidence of breast cancer per 100,000 women rose from around 102 cases per year in the 1970s to around 141 in the late-1990s, and has since fallen, holding steady around 125 since 2003. However, age-adjusted deaths from breast cancer per 100,000 women only rose slightly from 31.4 in 1975 to 33.2 in 1989 and have since declined steadily to 20.5 in 2014.[211]\n\n\n\n## Multiple primary tumours[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Quadrants of breast.\nMultiple primary tumours can arise in different sites (as opposed to a single tumour spreading). These tumours can occur in both breasts (bilateral tumours), in different quadrants of a single breast (multi-centric cancer), or separate tumours within a single breast quadrant (multi-focal cancer).[212][213]\n\n\nIncidence of multi-centric and multi-focal breast cancers (MMBC) is increasing, partly due to improving mammography technology.[214] Incidence of MMBC is reported between 9 and 75% in high income countries, depending on criteria used.[214] For instance, China reported that only 2% of patients are defined as MMBC.[214] The reason for this difference is due to lack of uniformity in diagnosis.[214] Therefore, standardised method and criteria should be made in order to define the incidence of MMBC correctly.[214]\n\n\nMutations in tumour suppressor genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and PTEN can be related to formation of multiple primary breast cancers.[215] Diagnosis occurs via the same modalities as other breast cancers.\n\n\nMastectomy is the standard surgical treatment for multi centric breast cancer patients.[216] Double lumpectomies, also labelled as breast conservative therapy (BCT), is an alternative and preferred surgical treatment to mastectomy for early stage multi centric breast cancer patients.[217] The procedure of double lumpectomies involves the surgical ablation of the cancerous tumour foci and the surrounding breast tissues in different quadrant of the same breast.[217] The benefits of double lumpectomies are the avoidance of breast reconstruction surgery and minimal breast scarring. However, it is not preferred for patients with more than two tumours within the same breast due to difficulty in removing all cancer cells.[218] Patients with multiple primary breast tumours may receive treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and breast reconstruction surgery[218][219] for the same indications as other breast cancer patients.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Breast cancer surgery in 18th century\nBecause of its visibility, breast cancer was the form of cancer most often described in ancient documents.[220]: 9–13 Because autopsies were rare, cancers of the internal organs were essentially invisible to ancient medicine. Breast cancer, however, could be felt through the skin, and in its advanced state often developed into fungating lesions: the tumour would become necrotic (die from the inside, causing the tumour to appear to break up) and ulcerate through the skin, weeping fetid, dark fluid.[220]: 9–13\n\n\nThe oldest discovered evidence of breast cancer is from Egypt and dates back 4200 years, to the Sixth Dynasty.[221] The study of a woman's remains from the necropolis of Qubbet el-Hawa showed the typical destructive damage due to metastatic spread.[221] The Edwin Smith Papyrus describes eight cases of tumours or ulcers of the breast that were treated by cauterization. The writing says about the disease, \"There is no treatment.\"[222] For centuries, physicians described similar cases in their practices, with the same conclusion. Ancient medicine, from the time of the Greeks through the 17th century, was based on humoralism, and thus believed that breast cancer was generally caused by imbalances in the fundamental fluids that controlled the body, especially an excess of black bile.[220]: 32 Alternatively it was seen as divine punishment.[223]\n\n\nMastectomy for breast cancer was performed at least as early as AD 548, when it was proposed by the court physician Aetios of Amida to Theodora.[220]: 9–13 It was not until doctors achieved greater understanding of the circulatory system in the 17th century that they could link breast cancer's spread to the lymph nodes in the armpit. In the early 18th century the French surgeon Jean Louis Petit performed total mastectomies that included removing the axillary lymph nodes, as he recognized that this reduced recurrence.[224] Petit's work built on the methods of the surgeon Bernard Peyrilhe, who in the 17th century additionally removed the pectoral muscle underlying the breast, as he judged that this greatly improved the prognosis.[225] But poor results and the considerable risk to the patient meant that physicians did not share the opinion of surgeons such as Nicolaes Tulp, who in the 17th century proclaimed \"the sole remedy is a timely operation\". The eminent surgeon Richard Wiseman documented in the mid 17th century that following 12 mastectomies, two patients died during the operation, eight patients died shortly after the operation from progressive cancer and only two of the 12 patients were cured.[226]: 6 Physicians were conservative in the treatment they prescribed in the early stages of breast cancer. Patients were treated with a mixture of detox purges, blood letting and traditional remedies that were supposed to lower acidity, such as the alkaline arsenic.[227]: 24\n\n\nWhen in 1664 Anne of Austria was diagnosed with breast cancer, the initial treatment involved compresses saturated with hemlock juice. When the lumps increased the King's physician commenced a treatment with arsenic ointments.[227]: 25 The royal patient died 1666 in atrocious pain.[227]: 26 Each failing treatment for breast cancer led to the search for new treatments, spurring a market in remedies that were advertised and sold by quacks, herbalists, chemists and apothecaries.[228] The lack of anesthesia and antiseptics made mastectomy a painful and dangerous ordeal.[226] In the 18th century, a wide variety of anatomical discoveries were accompanied by new theories about the cause and growth of breast cancer. The investigative surgeon John Hunter claimed that neural fluid generated breast cancer. Other surgeons proposed that milk within the mammary ducts led to cancerous growths. Theories about trauma to the breast as cause for malignant changes in breast tissue were advanced. The discovery of breast lumps and swellings fueled controversies about hard tumours and whether lumps were benign stages of cancer. Medical opinion about necessary immediate treatment varied.[226]: 5 The surgeon Benjamin Bell advocated removal of the entire breast, even when only a portion was affected.[229]\n\n\n\n![](image)Radical mastectomy, Halsted's surgical papers\nBreast cancer was uncommon until the 19th century, when improvements in sanitation and control of deadly infectious diseases resulted in dramatic increases in lifespan. Previously, most women had died too young to have developed breast cancer.[230] In 1878, an article in *Scientific American* described historical treatment by pressure intended to induce local ischemia in cases when surgical removal were not possible.[231] William Stewart Halsted started performing radical mastectomies in 1882, helped greatly by advances in general surgical technology, such as aseptic technique and anesthesia. The Halsted radical mastectomy often involved removing both breasts, associated lymph nodes, and the underlying chest muscles. This often led to long-term pain and disability, but was seen as necessary to prevent the cancer from recurring.[220]: 102–106 Before the advent of the Halsted radical mastectomy, 20-year survival rates were only 10%; Halsted's surgery raised that rate to 50%.[220]: 1\n\n\nBreast cancer staging systems were developed in the 1920s and 1930s to determining the extent to which a cancer has developed by growing and spreading.[220]: 102–106 The first case-controlled study on breast cancer epidemiology was done by Janet Lane-Claypon, who published a comparative study in 1926 of 500 breast cancer cases and 500 controls of the same background and lifestyle for the British Ministry of Health.[232] Radical mastectomies remained the standard of care in the USA until the 1970s, but in Europe, breast-sparing procedures, often followed by radiation therapy, were generally adopted in the 1950s.[220]: 102–106 In 1955 George Crile Jr. published *Cancer and Common Sense* arguing that cancer patients needed to understand available treatment options. Crile became a close friend of the environmentalist Rachel Carson, who had undergone a Halsted radical mastectomy in 1960 to treat her malign breast cancer.[233]: 39–40 The US oncologist Jerome Urban promoted superradical mastectomies, taking even more tissue, until 1963, when the ten-year survival rates proved equal to the less-damaging radical mastectomy.[220]: 102–106 Carson died in 1964 and Crile went on to published a wide variety of articles, both in the popular press and in medical journals, challenging the widespread used of the Halsted radical mastectomy. In 1973 Crile published *What Women Should Know About the Breast Cancer Controversy*. When in 1974 Betty Ford was diagnosed with breast cancer, the options for treating breast cancer were openly discussed in the press.[233]: 58 During the 1970s, a new understanding of metastasis led to perceiving cancer as a systemic illness as well as a localized one, and more sparing procedures were developed that proved equally effective.[234]\n\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, thousands of women who had successfully completed standard treatment then demanded and received high-dose bone marrow transplants, thinking this would lead to better long-term survival. However, it proved completely ineffective, and 15–20% of women died because of the brutal treatment.[235]: 200–203 The 1995 reports from the Nurses' Health Study and the 2002 conclusions of the Women's Health Initiative trial conclusively proved that hormone replacement therapy significantly increased the incidence of breast cancer.[235]\n\n\n\n## Society and culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Breast cancer awareness and List of people with breast cancer\n\nBefore the 20th century, breast cancer was feared and discussed in hushed tones, as if it were shameful. As little could be safely done with primitive surgical techniques, women tended to suffer silently rather than seeking care.[*citation needed*] When surgery advanced, and long-term survival rates improved, women began raising awareness of the disease and the possibility of successful treatment. The \"Women's Field Army\", run by the American Society for the Control of Cancer (later the American Cancer Society) during the 1930s and 1940s was one of the first organized campaigns. In 1952, the first peer-to-peer support group, called \"Reach to Recovery\", began providing post-mastectomy, in-hospital visits from women who had survived breast cancer.[235]: 37–38\n\n\nThe breast cancer movement of the 1980s and 1990s developed out of the larger feminist movements and women's health movement of the 20th century.[235]: 4 This series of political and educational campaigns, partly inspired by the politically and socially effective AIDS awareness campaigns, resulted in the widespread acceptance of second opinions before surgery, less invasive surgical procedures, support groups, and other advances in care.[236]\n\n\n\n### Pink ribbon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The pink ribbon is a symbol to show support for breast cancer awareness.\nMain article: Pink ribbon\n\nA pink ribbon is the most prominent symbol of breast cancer awareness. Pink ribbons, which can be made inexpensively, are sometimes sold as fundraisers, much like poppies on Remembrance Day. They may be worn to honor those who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, or to identify products that the manufacturer would like to sell to consumers that are interested in breast cancer.[235]: 27–72 In the 1990s breast cancer awareness campaigns were launched by US based corporations. As part of these cause related marketing campaigns corporations donated to a variety of breast cancer initiatives for every pink ribbon product that was purchased.[237]>: 132–133 *The Wall Street Journal* noted \"that the strong emotions provoked by breast cancer translate to a company's bottom line\". While many US corporations donated to existing breast cancer initiatives others such as Avon established their own breast cancer foundations on the back of pink ribbon products.[237]: 135–136\n\n\nWearing or displaying a pink ribbon has been criticized by the opponents of this practice as a kind of slacktivism, because it has no practical positive effect. It has also been criticized as hypocrisy, because some people wear the pink ribbon to show good will towards women with breast cancer, but then oppose these women's practical goals, like patient rights and anti-pollution legislation.[235]: 366–368[238] Critics say that the feel-good nature of pink ribbons and pink consumption distracts society from the lack of progress on preventing and curing breast cancer.[235]: 365–366 It is also criticized for reinforcing gender stereotypes and objectifying women and their breasts.<[235]: 372–374 In 2002 Breast Cancer Action launched the \"Think Before You Pink\" campaign against pinkwashing to target businesses that have co-opted the pink campaign to promote products that cause breast cancer, such as alcoholic beverages.[239]\n\n\n\n### Breast cancer culture[edit]\n\n\nIn her 2006 book *Pink Ribbons, Inc.: Breast Cancer and the Politics of Philanthropy* Samantha King claimed that breast cancer has been transformed from a serious disease and individual tragedy to a market-driven industry of survivorship and corporate sales pitch.[240] In 2010 Gayle Sulik argued that the primary purposes or goals of breast cancer culture are to maintain breast cancer's dominance as the pre-eminent women's health issue, to promote the appearance that society is doing something effective about breast cancer, and to sustain and expand the social, political, and financial power of breast cancer activists.[235]: 57 In the same year Barbara Ehrenreich published an opinion piece in *Harper's Magazine*, lamenting that in breast cancer culture, breast cancer therapy is viewed as a rite of passage rather than a disease. To fit into this mold, the woman with breast cancer needs to normalize and feminize her appearance, and minimize the disruption that her health issues cause anyone else. Anger, sadness, and negativity must be silenced. As with most cultural models, people who conform to the model are given social status, in this case as cancer survivors. Women who reject the model are shunned, punished and shamed. The culture is criticized for treating adult women like little girls, as evidenced by \"baby\" toys such as pink teddy bears given to adult women.[241]\n\n\n\n### Emphasis[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009 the US science journalist Christie Aschwanden criticized that the emphasis on breast cancer screening may be harming women by subjecting them to unnecessary radiation, biopsies, and surgery. One-third of diagnosed breast cancers might recede on their own.[242] Screening mammography efficiently finds non-life-threatening, asymptomatic breast cancers and precancers, even while overlooking serious cancers. According to the cancer researcher H. Gilbert Welch, screening mammography has taken the \"brain-dead approach that says the best test is the one that finds the most cancers\" rather than the one that finds dangerous cancers.[242]\n\n\nIn 2002 it was noted that as a result of breast cancer's high visibility, the statistical results can be misinterpreted, such as the claim that one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lives – a claim that depends on the unrealistic assumption that no woman will die of any other disease before the age of 95.[220]: 199–200 By 2010 the breast cancer survival rate in Europe was 91% at one years and 65% at five years. In the USA the five-year survival rate for localized breast cancer was 96.8%, while in cases of metastases it was only 20.6%. Because the prognosis for breast cancer was at this stage relatively favorable, compared to the prognosis for other cancers, breast cancer as cause of death among women was 13.9% of all cancer deaths. The second most common cause of death from cancer in women was lung cancer, the most common cancer worldwide for men and women. The improved survival rate made breast cancer the most prevalent cancer in the world. In 2010 an estimated 3.6 million women worldwide have had a breast cancer diagnosis in the past five years, while only 1.4 million male or female survivors from lung cancer were alive.[243]\n\n\n\n## Health disparities in breast cancer[edit]\n\n\nThere are ethnic disparities in the mortality rates for breast cancer as well as in breast cancer treatment. Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer affecting women of every ethnic group in the United States. Breast cancer incidence among black women aged 45 and older is higher than that of white women in the same age group. White women aged 60–84 have higher incidence rates of breast cancer than Black women. Despite this, Black women at every age are more likely to succumb to breast cancer.[244]\n\n\nBreast cancer treatment has improved greatly in recent years, but black women are still less likely to obtain treatment compared to white women.[244] Risk factors such as socioeconomic status, late-stage, or breast cancer at diagnosis, genetic differences in tumour subtypes, differences in health care access all contribute to these disparities. Socioeconomic determinants affecting the disparity in breast cancer illness include poverty, culture, as well as social injustice. In Hispanic women, the incidence of breast cancer is lower than in non-Hispanic women but is often diagnosed at a later stage than white women with larger tumors.\n\n\nBlack women are usually diagnosed with breast cancer at a younger age than white women. The median age of diagnosis for Black women is 59, in comparison to 62 in White women. The incidence of breast cancer in Black women has increased by 0.4% per year since 1975 and 1.5% per year among Asian/Pacific Islander women since 1992. Incidence rates were stable for non-Hispanic White, Hispanics, and Native women. The five-year survival rate is noted to be 81% in Black women and 92% in White women. Chinese and Japanese women have the highest survival rates.[244]\n\n\nPoverty is a major driver for disparities related to breast cancer. Low-income women are less likely to undergo breast cancer screening and thus are more likely to have a late-stage diagnosis.[244] Ensuring women of all ethnic groups receive equitable health care including breast screening, can positively affect these disparities.[245]\n\n\n\n## Pregnancy[edit]\n\n\nPregnancy at an early age decreases the risk of developing breast cancer later in life.[246] The risk of breast cancer also declines with the number of children a woman has.[246] Breast cancer then becomes more common in the 5 or 10 years following pregnancy but then becomes less common than among the general population.[247] These cancers are known as postpartum breast cancer and have worse outcomes including an increased risk of distant spread of disease and mortality.[248] Other cancers found during or shortly after pregnancy appear at approximately the same rate as other cancers in women of a similar age.[249]\n\n\nDiagnosing new cancer in a pregnant woman is difficult, in part because any symptoms are commonly assumed to be a normal discomfort associated with pregnancy.[249] As a result, cancer is typically discovered at a somewhat later stage than average in many pregnant or recently pregnant women. Some imaging procedures, such as MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging), CT scans, ultrasounds, and mammograms with fetal shielding are considered safe during pregnancy; some others, such as PET scans are not.[249]\n\n\nTreatment is generally the same as for non-pregnant women.[249] However, radiation is normally avoided during pregnancy, especially if the fetal dose might exceed 100 cGy. In some cases, some or all treatments are postponed until after birth if the cancer is diagnosed late in the pregnancy. Early deliveries to speed the start of treatment are not uncommon. Surgery is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but some other treatments, especially certain chemotherapy drugs given during the first trimester, increase the risk of birth defects and pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortions and stillbirths).[249] Elective abortions are not required and do not improve the likelihood of the mother surviving or being cured.[249]\n\n\nRadiation treatments may interfere with the mother's ability to breastfeed her baby because it reduces the ability of that breast to produce milk and increases the risk of mastitis. Also, when chemotherapy is being given after birth, many of the drugs pass through breast milk to the baby, which could harm the baby.[249]\n\n\nRegarding future pregnancy among breast cancer survivors, there is often fear of cancer recurrence.[250] On the other hand, many still regard pregnancy and parenthood to represent normality, happiness and life fulfillment.[250]\n\n\n\n## Hormones[edit]\n\n\n### Birth control[edit]\n\n\nIn breast cancer survivors, non-hormonal birth control methods such as the copper intrauterine device (IUD) should be used as first-line options.[251] Progestogen-based methods such as depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, IUD with progestogen or progestogen only pills have a poorly investigated but possible increased risk of cancer recurrence, but may be used if positive effects outweigh this possible risk.[252]\n\n\n\n### Menopausal hormone replacement[edit]\n\n\nIn breast cancer survivors, it is recommended to first consider non-hormonal options for menopausal effects, such as bisphosphonates or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for osteoporosis, and vaginal estrogen for local symptoms. Observational studies of systemic hormone replacement therapy after breast cancer are generally reassuring. If hormone replacement is necessary after breast cancer, estrogen-only therapy or estrogen therapy with an intrauterine device with progestogen may be safer options than combined systemic therapy.[253]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nTreatments are being evaluated in clinical trials. This includes individual drugs, combinations of drugs, and surgical and radiation techniques Investigations include new types of targeted therapy,[254] cancer vaccines, oncolytic virotherapy,[255] gene therapy[256][257] and immunotherapy.[258]\n\n\nThe latest research is reported annually at scientific meetings such as that of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium,[259] and the St. Gallen Oncology Conference in St. Gallen, Switzerland.[260] These studies are reviewed by professional societies and other organizations, and formulated into guidelines for specific treatment groups and risk category.\n\n\nFenretinide, a retinoid, is also being studied as a way to reduce the risk of breast cancer.[261][262] In particular, combinations of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy have been the subject of clinical trials.[263]\n\n\nA 2019 review found moderate certainty evidence that giving people antibiotics before breast cancer surgery helped to prevent surgical site infection (SSI). Further study is required to determine the most effective antibiotic protocol and use in women undergoing immediate breast reconstruction.[264]\n\n\n\n### Cryoablation[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2014 cryoablation is being studied to see if it could be a substitute for a lumpectomy in small cancers.[265] There is tentative evidence in those with tumours less than 2 centimeters.[266] It may also be used in those in who surgery is not possible.[266] Another review states that cryoablation looks promising for early breast cancer of small size.[267]\n\n\n\n### Breast cancer cell lines[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of breast cancer cell lines\n\nPart of the current knowledge on breast carcinomas is based on in vivo and in vitro studies performed with cell lines derived from breast cancers. These provide an unlimited source of homogenous self-replicating material, free of contaminating stromal cells, and often easily cultured in simple standard media. The first breast cancer cell line described, BT-20, was established in 1958. Since then, and despite sustained work in this area, the number of permanent lines obtained has been strikingly low (about 100). Indeed, attempts to culture breast cancer cell lines from primary tumours have been largely unsuccessful. This poor efficiency was often due to technical difficulties associated with the extraction of viable tumour cells from their surrounding stroma. Most of the available breast cancer cell lines issued from metastatic tumours, mainly from pleural effusions. Effusions provided generally large numbers of dissociated, viable tumour cells with little or no contamination by fibroblasts and other tumour stroma cells.\nMany of the currently used BCC lines were established in the late 1970s. A very few of them, namely MCF-7, T-47D, MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3, account for more than two-thirds of all abstracts reporting studies on mentioned breast cancer cell lines, as concluded from a Medline-based survey.\n\n\n\n### Molecular markers[edit]\n\n\n#### Metabolic markers[edit]\n\n\nClinically, the most useful metabolic markers in breast cancer are the estrogen and progesterone receptors that are used to predict response to hormone therapy. New or potentially new markers for breast cancer include BRCA1 and BRCA2[268] to identify people at high risk of developing breast cancer, HER-2,[*medical citation needed*] and SCD1, for predicting response to therapeutic regimens, and urokinase plasminogen activator, PA1-1 and SCD1 for assessing prognosis.[*medical citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Other animals[edit]\n\n\n* Mammary tumor for breast cancer in other animals\n* Mouse models of breast cancer metastasis\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** \"Breast Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)\". *NCI*. 23 May 2014.

A 2013 Cochrane review found that it was unclear if mammographic screening does more harm than good, in that a large proportion of women who test positive turn out not to have the disease.[10] A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age,[11] and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years of age.[12] The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it.[2] Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventive measure in some high risk women.[2] In those who have been diagnosed with cancer, a number of treatments may be used, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and targeted therapy.[1] Types of surgery vary from breast-conserving surgery to mastectomy.[13][14] Breast reconstruction may take place at the time of surgery or at a later date.[14] In those in whom the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, treatments are mostly aimed at improving quality of life and comfort.[14]\n\n\nOutcomes for breast cancer vary depending on the cancer type, the extent of disease, and the person's age.[14] The five-year survival rates in England and the United States are between 80 and 90%.[15][4][5] In developing countries, five-year survival rates are lower.[2] Worldwide, breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women, accounting for 25% of all cases.[16] In 2018, it resulted in 2 million new cases and 627,000 deaths.[17] It is more common in developed countries[2] and is more than 100 times more common in women than in men.[15][18]\n\n\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Breast cancer showing an inverted nipple, lump, and skin dimpling\n![](image)Early signs of possible breast cancer\nBreast cancer most commonly presents as a lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of cases are discovered when a person detects such a lump with the fingertips.[19] The earliest breast cancers, however, are detected by a mammogram.[20][21] Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits[19] may also indicate breast cancer.\n\n\nIndications of breast cancer other than a lump may include thickening different from the other breast tissue, one breast becoming larger or lower, a nipple changing position or shape or becoming inverted, skin puckering or dimpling, a rash on or around a nipple, discharge from nipple/s, constant pain in part of the breast or armpit and swelling beneath the armpit or around the collarbone.[22] Pain (\"mastodynia\") is an unreliable tool in determining the presence or absence of breast cancer, but may be indicative of other breast health issues.[19][20][23]\n\n\nAnother symptom complex of breast cancer is Paget's disease of the breast. This syndrome presents as skin changes resembling eczema; such as redness, discoloration or mild flaking of the nipple skin. As Paget's disease of the breast advances, symptoms may include tingling, itching, increased sensitivity, burning, and pain. There may also be discharge from the nipple. Approximately half the women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the breast also have a lump in the breast.[24][25]\n\n\nInflammatory breast cancer is a rare (only seen in less than 5% of breast cancer diagnosis) yet aggressive form of breast cancer characterized by the swollen, red areas formed on the top of the breast. The visual effects of inflammatory breast cancer is a result of a blockage of lymph vessels by cancer cells. This type of breast cancer is seen in more commonly diagnosed in younger ages, obese women and African American women. As inflammatory breast cancer does not present as a lump there can sometimes be a delay in diagnosis.[26]\n\n\nMammary secretory carcinoma (MSC) is a rare form of the secretory carcinomas that occurs exclusively in the breast.[27] It usually develops in adults but in a significant percentage of cases also affects children:[28] MSC accounts for 80% of all childhood breast cancers.[29] MSC lesions are typically slow growing, painless, small ductal breast tumours that have invaded the tissue around their ducts of origin, often spread to sentinel lymph nodes and/or axillary lymph nodes, but rarely metastasized to distant tissues.[30] These tumours typically have distinctive microscopic features and tumour cells that carry a balanced genetic translocation in which part of the *NTRK3* gene is fused to part of the *ETV6* gene[31] to form a fusion gene, *ETV6-NTRK3*. This fusion gene encodes a chimeric protein termed ETV6-NTRK3. The NTRK3 part of ETV6-NTRK3 protein has up-regulated tyrosine kinase activity that stimulates two signaling pathways, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways, which promote cell proliferation and survival and thereby may contribute to the development of MSC.[28] Conservative surgery, modified radical mastectomy, and radical mastectomy have been the most frequent procedures used to treat adults, while simple mastectomy, local excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy, and complete axillary dissection have been recommended to treat children with MSC.[32] In all cases, long-term, e.g. >20 years, follow-up examinations are recommended.[27][31] The relatively rare cases of MSC that have metastasized to distant tissues have shown little or no responses to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Three patients with metastatic disease had good partial responses to Entrectinib, a drug that inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion protein.[33] Because of its slow growth and low rate of metastasis to distant tissues, individuals with MSC have had 20 year survival rates of 93.16%.[27]\n\n\nIn rare cases, what initially appears as a fibroadenoma (hard, movable non-cancerous lump) could in fact be a phyllodes tumour. Phyllodes tumours are formed within the stroma (connective tissue) of the breast and contain glandular as well as stromal tissue. Phyllodes tumours are not staged in the usual sense; they are classified on the basis of their appearance under the microscope as benign, borderline or malignant.[34]\n\n\nMalignant tumours can result in metastatic tumours – secondary tumours (originating from the primary tumour) that spread beyond the site of origination. The symptoms caused by metastatic breast cancer will depend on the location of metastasis. Common sites of metastasis include bone, liver, lung, and brain.[35] When cancer has reached such an invasive state, it is categorized as a stage 4 cancer, cancers of this state are often fatal.[36] Common symptoms of stage 4 cancer include unexplained weight loss, bone and joint pain, jaundice and neurological symptoms. These symptoms are called non-specific symptoms because they could be manifestations of many other illnesses.[37] Rarely breast cancer can spread to exceedingly uncommon sites such as peripancreatic lymph nodes causing biliary obstruction leading to diagnostic difficulties.[38]\n\n\n\n![Tumor in the breast visualized by Breast-CT](image)Tumour in the breast visualized by Breast-Computertomography (Breast-CT)\nMost symptoms of breast disorders, including most lumps, do not turn out to represent underlying breast cancer. Less than 20% of lumps, for example, are cancerous,[39] and benign breast diseases such as mastitis and fibroadenoma of the breast are more common causes of breast disorder symptoms.[40]\n\n\n\n## Risk factors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Risk factors of breast cancer\n\nRisk factors can be divided into two categories:\n\n\n\n* *modifiable* risk factors (things that people can change themselves, such as consumption of alcoholic beverages), and\n* *fixed* risk factors (things that cannot be changed, such as age and biological sex).[41]\n\n\nThe primary risk factors for breast cancer are being female and older age.[42] Most breast cancers develop in women over 50. Women in their early 50s are twice as more likely to develop breast cancer than women in their early 40s.[43]\n\n\nOther potential risk factors include genetics,[44] lack of childbearing or lack of breastfeeding,[45] higher levels of certain hormones,[46][47] certain dietary patterns, and obesity. Exposure to artificial light during sleeping might also be risk factor for the development of breast cancer.[48]\n\n\nActions to prevent breast cancer include not drinking alcoholic beverages, maintaining a healthy body composition, avoiding smoking and eating healthy food. Combining all of these (leading the healthiest possible lifestyle) would make almost a quarter of breast cancer cases worldwide preventable.[49] The remaining three-quarters of breast cancer cases cannot be prevented through lifestyle changes.[49]\n\n\n\n### Lifestyle[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Alcohol and breast cancer and List of breast carcinogenic substances\n\n![Diagram of different sizes, showing how big a single serving of alcohol is for different types of alcoholic beverages](image)All types of alcoholic beverages, including beer, wine, or liquor, cause breast cancer.\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\nDrinking alcohol, even at low levels, increases the risk of breast cancer  \nAdditional risk from drinking[50][51]\n\nOriginal breast cancer risk (=100%)\n\nDrinking alcoholic beverages increases the risk of breast cancer, even among very light drinkers (women drinking less than half of one alcoholic drink per day).[50] The risk is highest among heavy drinkers.[52] Globally, about one in 10 cases of breast cancer is caused by women drinking alcoholic beverages.[52] Drinking alcoholic beverages is among the most common modifiable risk factors.[53]\n\n\nObesity and diabetes increase the risk of breast cancer. A high body mass index (BMI) causes 7% of breast cancers while diabetes is responsible for 2%.[43][54] At the same time the correlation between obesity and breast cancer is anything but linear. Studies show that those who rapidly gain weight in adulthood are at higher risk than those who have been overweight since childhood. Likewise excess fat in the midsection seems to induce a higher risk than excess weight carried in the lower body.[55] Dietary factors that may increase risk include a high-fat diet[56] and obesity-related high cholesterol levels.[57][58]\n\n\nDietary iodine deficiency may also play a role in the development of breast cancer.[59]\n\n\nSmoking tobacco appears to increase the risk of breast cancer, with the greater the amount smoked and the earlier in life that smoking began, the higher the risk.[60] In those who are long-term smokers, the relative risk is increased 35% to 50%.[60]\n\n\nA lack of physical activity has been linked to about 10% of cases.[61] Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from breast cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.[62]\n\n\nBreast feeding reduces the risk of several types of cancers, including breast cancer.[63][64][65][66] In the 1980s, the abortion–breast cancer hypothesis posited that induced abortion increased the risk of developing breast cancer.[67] This hypothesis was the subject of extensive scientific inquiry, which concluded that neither miscarriages nor abortions are associated with a heightened risk for breast cancer.[68]\n\n\nOther risk factors include radiation[69] and circadian disruptions related to shift-work[70] and routine late-night eating.[71] A number of chemicals have also been linked, including polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and organic solvents[72] Although the radiation from mammography is a low dose, it is estimated that yearly screening from 40 to 80 years of age will cause approximately 225 cases of fatal breast cancer per million women screened.[73]\n\n\n\n### Hormone therapy and hormonal contraception[edit]\n\n\nIn general, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to treat menopause is associated with only a small increased risk of breast cancer.[74][75][76] The level of risk also depends on the type of HRT, the duration of the treatment and the age of the person. Oestrogen-only HRT, taken by people who had a hysterectomy, comes with an extremely low level of breast cancer risk. The most commonly taken combined HRT (oestrogen and progestogen) is linked to a small risk of breast cancer. This risk is lower for women in their 50s and higher for older women. The risk increases with the duration of HRT. When HRT is taken for a year or less, there is no increased risk of breast cancer. HRT taken for more than 5 years comes with an increased risk but the risk reduces after the therapy is stopped.[75][76]\n\n\nThe use of hormonal birth control does not cause breast cancer for most women;[77] if it has an effect, it is small (on the order of 0.01% per user–year; comparable to the rate of maternal mortality in the United States[78]), temporary, and offset by the users' significantly reduced risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers.[78] Among those with a family history of breast cancer, use of modern oral contraceptives does not appear to affect the risk of breast cancer.[79] It is less certain whether hormonal contraceptives could increase the already high rates of breast cancer in women with mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes *BRCA1* or *BRCA2*.[80]\n\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nGenetics is believed to be the primary cause of 5–10% of all cases.[81] Women whose mother was diagnosed before 50 have an increased risk of 1.7 and those whose mother was diagnosed at age 50 or after has an increased risk of 1.4.[82] In those with zero, one or two affected relatives, the risk of breast cancer before the age of 80 is 7.8%, 13.3%, and 21.1% with a subsequent mortality from the disease of 2.3%, 4.2%, and 7.6% respectively.[83] In those with a first degree relative with the disease the risk of breast cancer between the age of 40 and 50 is double that of the general population.[84]\n\n\nIn less than 5% of cases, genetics plays a more significant role by causing a hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome.[85] This includes those who carry the *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* gene mutation.[85] These mutations account for up to 90% of the total genetic influence with a risk of breast cancer of 60–80% in those affected.[81] Other significant mutations include *p53* (Li–Fraumeni syndrome), *PTEN* (Cowden syndrome), and *STK11* (Peutz–Jeghers syndrome), *CHEK2*, *ATM*, *BRIP1*, and *PALB2*.[81] In 2012, researchers said that there are four genetically distinct types of the breast cancer and that in each type, hallmark genetic changes lead to many cancers.[86]\n\n\nOther genetic predispositions include the density of the breast tissue and hormonal levels. Women with dense breast tissue are more likely to get tumours and are less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer – because the dense tissue makes tumours less visible on mammograms. Furthermore, women with naturally high estrogen and progesterone levels are also at higher risk for tumour development.[87][88]\n\n\n\n### Medical conditions[edit]\n\n\nBreast changes like atypical ductal hyperplasia[89] and lobular carcinoma *in situ*,[90][91] found in benign breast conditions such as fibrocystic breast changes, are correlated with an increased breast cancer risk.\n\n\nDiabetes mellitus might also increase the risk of breast cancer.[92] Autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus seem also to increase the risk for the acquisition of breast cancer.[93]\n\n\nThe major causes of sporadic breast cancer are associated with hormone levels. Breast cancer is promoted by estrogen. This hormone activates the development of breast throughout puberty, menstrual cycles and pregnancy. The imbalance between estrogen and progesterone during the menstrual phases causes cell proliferation. Moreover, oxidative metabolites of estrogen can increase DNA damage and mutations. Repeated cycling and the impairment of repair process can transform a normal cell into pre-malignant and eventually malignant cell through mutation. During the premalignant stage, high proliferation of stromal cells can be activated by estrogen to support the development of breast cancer. During the ligand binding activation, the ER can regulate gene expression by interacting with estrogen response elements within the promotor of specific genes. The expression and activation of ER due to lack of estrogen can be stimulated by extracellular signals.[94] Interestingly, the ER directly binding with the several proteins, including growth factor receptors, can promote the expression of genes related to cell growth and survival.[95]\n\n\nRaised prolactin levels in the blood are associated with increased risk of breast cancer.[96] A meta-analysis of observational research with over two million individuals has suggested a moderate association of antipsychotic use with breast cancer, possibly mediated by prolactin-inducing properties of specific agents.[97]\n\n\n\n## Pathophysiology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Carcinogenesis\n\n![](image)Ducts and lobules, the main locations of breast cancers\n![](image)Overview of signal transduction pathways involved in programmed cell death. Mutations leading to loss of this ability can lead to cancer formation.\nBreast cancer, like other cancers, occurs because of an interaction between an environmental (external) factor and a genetically susceptible host. Normal cells divide as many times as needed and stop. They attach to other cells and stay in place in tissues. Cells become cancerous when they lose their ability to stop dividing, to attach to other cells, to stay where they belong, and to die at the proper time.\n\n\nNormal cells will self-destruct (programmed cell death) when they are no longer needed. Until then, cells are protected from programmed death by several protein clusters and pathways. One of the protective pathways is the PI3K/AKT pathway; another is the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway. Sometimes the genes along these protective pathways are mutated in a way that turns them permanently \"on\", rendering the cell incapable of self-destructing when it is no longer needed. This is one of the steps that causes cancer in combination with other mutations. Normally, the PTEN protein turns off the PI3K/AKT pathway when the cell is ready for programmed cell death. In some breast cancers, the gene for the PTEN protein is mutated, so the PI3K/AKT pathway is stuck in the \"on\" position, and the cancer cell does not self-destruct.[98]\n\n\nMutations that can lead to breast cancer have been experimentally linked to estrogen exposure.[99] Additionally, G-protein coupled estrogen receptors have been associated with various cancers of the female reproductive system including breast cancer.[100]\n\n\nAbnormal growth factor signaling in the interaction between stromal cells and epithelial cells can facilitate malignant cell growth.[101][102] In breast adipose tissue, overexpression of leptin leads to increased cell proliferation and cancer.[103]\n\n\nIn the United States, 10 to 20 percent of women with breast cancer or ovarian cancer have a first- or second-degree relative with one of these diseases. Men with breast cancer have an even higher likelihood. The familial tendency to develop these cancers is called hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome. The best known of these, the *BRCA* mutations, confer a lifetime risk of breast cancer of between 60 and 85 percent and a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of between 15 and 40 percent. Some mutations associated with cancer, such as *p53*, *BRCA1* and *BRCA2*, occur in mechanisms to correct errors in DNA. These mutations are either inherited or acquired after birth. Presumably, they allow further mutations, which allow uncontrolled division, lack of attachment, and metastasis to distant organs.[69][104] However, there is strong evidence of residual risk variation that goes well beyond hereditary *BRCA* gene mutations between carrier families. This is caused by unobserved risk factors.[105] This implicates environmental and other causes as triggers for breast cancers. The inherited mutation in *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* genes can interfere with repair of DNA cross links and DNA double strand breaks (known functions of the encoded protein).[106] These carcinogens cause DNA damage such as DNA cross links and double strand breaks that often require repairs by pathways containing BRCA1 and BRCA2.[107][108] However, mutations in *BRCA* genes account for only 2 to 3 percent of all breast cancers.[109] Levin *et al.* say that cancer may not be inevitable for all carriers of *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* mutations.[110] About half of hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndromes involve unknown genes. Furthermore, certain latent viruses, may decrease the expression of the *BRCA1* gene and increase the risk of breast tumours.[111]\n\n\nGATA-3 directly controls the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and other genes associated with epithelial differentiation, and the loss of GATA-3 leads to loss of differentiation and poor prognosis due to cancer cell invasion and metastasis.[112]\n\n\n\n## Diagnosis[edit]\n\n\nMost types of breast cancer are easy to diagnose by microscopic analysis of a sample – or biopsy – of the affected area of the breast. Also, there are types of breast cancer that require specialized lab exams.\n\n\nThe two most commonly used screening methods, physical examination of the breasts by a healthcare provider and mammography, can offer an approximate likelihood that a lump is cancer, and may also detect some other lesions, such as a simple cyst.[113] When these examinations are inconclusive, a healthcare provider can remove a sample of the fluid in the lump for microscopic analysis (a procedure known as fine needle aspiration, or fine needle aspiration and cytology, FNAC) to help establish the diagnosis. A needle aspiration can be performed in a healthcare provider's office or clinic. A local anesthetic may be used to numb the breast tissue to prevent pain during the procedure, but may not be necessary if the lump is not beneath the skin. A finding of clear fluid makes the lump highly unlikely to be cancerous, but bloody fluid may be sent off for inspection under a microscope for cancerous cells. Together, physical examination of the breasts, mammography, and FNAC can be used to diagnose breast cancer with a good degree of accuracy.\n\n\nOther options for biopsy include a core biopsy or vacuum-assisted breast biopsy,[114] which are procedures in which a section of the breast lump is removed; or an excisional biopsy, in which the entire lump is removed. Very often the results of physical examination by a healthcare provider, mammography, and additional tests that may be performed in special circumstances (such as imaging by ultrasound or MRI) are sufficient to warrant excisional biopsy as the definitive diagnostic and primary treatment method.[115][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)**Breast cancer cell**\n* ![MRI showing breast cancer](image)\n\nMRI showing breast cancer\n* ![Excised human breast tissue, showing an irregular, dense, white stellate area of cancer 2 cm in diameter, within yellow fatty tissue](image)\n\nExcised human breast tissue, showing an irregular, dense, white stellate area of cancer 2 cm in diameter, within yellow fatty tissue\n* ![High-grade invasive ductal carcinoma, with minimal tubule formation, marked pleomorphism, and prominent mitoses, 40x field](image)\n\nHigh-grade invasive ductal carcinoma, with minimal tubule formation, marked pleomorphism, and prominent mitoses, 40x field\n* ![Micrograph showing a lymph node invaded by ductal breast carcinoma, with an extension of the tumor beyond the lymph node](image)\n\nMicrograph showing a lymph node invaded by ductal breast carcinoma, with an extension of the tumor beyond the lymph node\n* ![Neuropilin-2 expression in normal breast and breast carcinoma tissue](image)\n\nNeuropilin-2 expression in normal breast and breast carcinoma tissue\n* ![F-18 FDG PET/CT: A breast cancer metastasis to the right scapula](image)\n\nF-18 FDG PET/CT: A breast cancer metastasis to the right scapula\n* ![Needle breast biopsy](image)\n\nNeedle breast biopsy\n* ![Elastography shows stiff cancer tissue on ultrasound imaging.](image)\n\nElastography shows stiff cancer tissue on ultrasound imaging.\n* ![Ultrasound image shows irregularly shaped mass of breast cancer.](image)\n\nUltrasound image shows irregularly shaped mass of breast cancer.\n* ![Infiltrating (invasive) breast carcinoma](image)\n\nInfiltrating (invasive) breast carcinoma\n* ![Mammograms showing a normal breast (left) and a breast with cancer (right)](image)\n\nMammograms showing a normal breast (left) and a breast with cancer (right)\n\n\n### Classification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Breast cancer classification\n\nBreast cancers are classified by several grading systems. Each of these influences the prognosis and can affect treatment response. Description of a breast cancer optimally includes all of these factors.\n\n\n\n![](image)Histopathologic types of breast cancer, with relative incidences and prognoses\n* **Histopathology**. Breast cancer is usually classified primarily by its histological appearance. Most breast cancers are derived from the epithelium lining the ducts or lobules, and these cancers are classified as ductal or lobular carcinoma. *Carcinoma in situ* is growth of low-grade cancerous or precancerous cells within a particular tissue compartment such as the mammary duct without invasion of the surrounding tissue. In contrast, *invasive carcinoma* does not confine itself to the initial tissue compartment.[116]\n* **Grade**. Grading compares the appearance of the breast cancer cells to the appearance of normal breast tissue. Normal cells in an organ like the breast become differentiated, meaning that they take on specific shapes and forms that reflect their function as part of that organ. Cancerous cells lose that differentiation. In cancer, the cells that would normally line up in an orderly way to make up the milk ducts become disorganized. Cell division becomes uncontrolled. Cell nuclei become less uniform. Pathologists describe cells as well differentiated (low grade), moderately differentiated (intermediate grade), and poorly differentiated (high grade) as the cells progressively lose the features seen in normal breast cells. Poorly differentiated cancers (the ones whose tissue is least like normal breast tissue) have a worse prognosis.\n* **Stage**. Breast cancer staging using the TNM system is based on the size of the tumour (**T**), whether or not the tumour has spread to the lymph nodes (**N**) in the armpits, and whether the tumour has metastasized (**M**) (i.e. spread to a more distant part of the body). Larger size, nodal spread, and metastasis have a larger stage number and a worse prognosis.   \nThe main stages are:\n\t+ Stage 0 is a pre-cancerous or marker condition, either ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).\n\t+ Stages 1–3 are within the breast or regional lymph nodes.\n\t+ Stage 4 is 'metastatic' cancer that has a less favorable prognosis since it has spread beyond the breast and regional lymph nodes.\n\n\n* ![Stage T1 breast cancer](image)\n\nStage T1 breast cancer\n* ![Stage T2 breast cancer](image)\n\nStage T2 breast cancer\n* ![Stage T3 breast cancer](image)\n\nStage T3 breast cancer\n* ![Metastatic or stage 4 breast cancer](image)\n\nMetastatic or stage 4 breast cancer\n\n\nWhere available, imaging studies may be employed as part of the staging process in select cases to look for signs of metastatic cancer. However, in cases of breast cancer with low risk for metastasis, the risks associated with PET scans, CT scans, or bone scans outweigh the possible benefits, as these procedures expose the person to a substantial amount of potentially dangerous ionizing radiation.[117][118]\n* **Receptor status**. Breast cancer cells have receptors on their surface and in their cytoplasm and nucleus. Chemical messengers such as hormones bind to receptors, and this causes changes in the cell. Breast cancer cells may or may not have three important receptors: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2.   \nER+ cancer cells (that is, cancer cells that have estrogen receptors) depend on estrogen for their growth, so they can be treated with drugs to block estrogen effects (e.g. tamoxifen), and generally have a better prognosis. Untreated, HER2+ breast cancers are generally more aggressive than HER2- breast cancers,[119][120] but HER2+ cancer cells respond to drugs such as the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (in combination with conventional chemotherapy), and this has improved the prognosis significantly.[121] Cells that do not have any of these three receptor types (estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or HER2) are called triple-negative, although they frequently do express receptors for other hormones, such as androgen receptor and prolactin receptor.\n* **DNA assays**. DNA testing of various types including DNA microarrays have compared normal cells to breast cancer cells. The specific changes in a particular breast cancer can be used to classify the cancer in several ways, and may assist in choosing the most effective treatment for that DNA type.\n\n\n* ![Stage 1A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 1A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 1B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 1B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 4 breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 4 breast cancer\n\n\n## Screening[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Breast cancer screening\n\n![](image)A mobile breast cancer screening unit in New Zealand\nBreast cancer screening refers to testing otherwise-healthy women for breast cancer in an attempt to achieve an earlier diagnosis under the assumption that early detection will improve outcomes. A number of screening tests have been employed including clinical and self breast exams, mammography, genetic screening, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n\nA clinical or self breast exam involves feeling the breast for lumps or other abnormalities. Clinical breast exams are performed by health care providers, while self-breast exams are performed by the person themselves.[122] Evidence does not support the effectiveness of either type of breast exam, as by the time a lump is large enough to be found it is likely to have been growing for several years and thus soon be large enough to be found without an exam.[123][124] Mammographic screening for breast cancer uses X-rays to examine the breast for any uncharacteristic masses or lumps. During a screening, the breast is compressed and a technician takes photos from multiple angles. A general mammogram takes photos of the entire breast, while a diagnostic mammogram focuses on a specific lump or area of concern.[125]\n\n\nA number of national bodies recommend breast cancer screening. For the average woman, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and American College of Physicians recommends mammography every two years in women between the ages of 50 and 74,[12][126] the Council of Europe recommends mammography between 50 and 69 with most programs using a 2-year frequency,[127] while the European Commission recommends mammography from 45 to 75 every 2 to 3 years,[128] and in Canada screening is recommended between the ages of 50 and 74 at a frequency of 2 to 3 years.[129] The American Cancer Society also endorses that women ages 40 and older receive mammograms annually.[130] These task force reports point out that in addition to unnecessary surgery and anxiety, the risks of more frequent mammograms include a small but significant increase in breast cancer induced by radiation.[131]\n\n\nThe Cochrane collaboration (2013) states that the best quality evidence neither demonstrates a reduction in cancer specific, nor a reduction in all cause mortality from screening mammography.[10] When less rigorous trials are added to the analysis there is a reduction in mortality due to breast cancer of 0.05% (a decrease of 1 in 2000 deaths from breast cancer over 10 years or a relative decrease of 15% from breast cancer).[10] Screening over 10 years results in a 30% increase in rates of over-diagnosis and over-treatment (3 to 14 per 1000) and more than half will have at least one falsely positive test.[10][132] This has resulted in the view that it is not clear whether mammography screening does more good or harm.[10] Cochrane states that, due to recent improvements in breast cancer treatment, and the risks of false positives from breast cancer screening leading to unnecessary treatment, \"it therefore no longer seems beneficial to attend for breast cancer screening\" at any age.[133] Whether MRI as a screening method has greater harms or benefits when compared to standard mammography is not known.[134][135]\n\n\n\n## Prevention[edit]\n\n\n### Lifestyle[edit]\n\n\nWomen can reduce their risk of breast cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol use, increasing physical activity, and breast-feeding.[136] These modifications might prevent 38% of breast cancers in the US, 42% in the UK, 28% in Brazil, and 20% in China.[136] The benefits with moderate exercise such as brisk walking are seen at all age groups including postmenopausal women.[136][137] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer by about 14%.[138] Strategies that encourage regular physical activity and reduce obesity could also have other benefits, such as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[41] A study that included data from 130,957 women of European ancestry found \"strong evidence that greater levels of physical activity and less sedentary time are likely to reduce breast cancer risk, with results generally consistent across breast cancer subtypes\".[139]\n\n\nThe American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology advised in 2016 that people should eat a diet high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes.[140] Eating foods rich in soluble fiber contributes to reducing breast cancer risk.[141][142] High intake of citrus fruit has been associated with a 10% reduction in the risk of breast cancer.[143] Marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids appear to reduce the risk.[144] High consumption of soy-based foods may reduce risk.[145]\n\n\n\n### Pre-emptive surgery[edit]\n\n\nRemoval of both breasts before any cancer has been diagnosed or any suspicious lump or other lesion has appeared (a procedure known as \"prophylactic bilateral mastectomy\" or \"risk reducing mastectomy\") may be considered in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, which are associated with a substantially heightened risk for an eventual diagnosis of breast cancer.[146][147] Evidence is not strong enough to support this procedure in anyone but women at the highest risk.[148] BRCA testing is recommended in those with a high family risk after genetic counseling. It is not recommended routinely.[149] This is because there are many forms of changes in BRCA genes, ranging from harmless polymorphisms to obviously dangerous frameshift mutations.[149] The effect of most of the identifiable changes in the genes is uncertain. Testing in an average-risk person is particularly likely to return one of these indeterminate, useless results. Removing the second breast in a person who has breast cancer (contralateral risk‐reducing mastectomy or CRRM) may reduce the risk of cancer in the second breast, however, it is unclear if removing the second breast in those who have breast cancer improves survival.[148] An increasing number women who test positive for faulty BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes choose to have risk-reducing surgery. At the same time the average waiting time for undergoing the procedure is two-years which is much longer than recommended.[150][151]\n\n\n\n### Medications[edit]\n\n\nThe selective estrogen receptor modulators reduce the risk of breast cancer but increase the risk of thromboembolism and endometrial cancer.[152] There is no overall change in the risk of death.[152][153] They are thus not recommended for the prevention of breast cancer in women at average risk but it is recommended they be offered for those at high risk and over the age of 35.[154] The benefit of breast cancer reduction continues for at least five years after stopping a course of treatment with these medications.[155] Aromatase inhibitors (such as exemestane and anastrozole) may be more effective than selective estrogen receptor modulators (such as tamoxifen) at reducing breast cancer risk and they are not associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism.[156]\n\n\n\n## Management[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Breast cancer management\n\nThe management of breast cancer depends on various factors, including the stage of the cancer and the person's age. Treatments are more aggressive when the cancer is more advanced or there is a higher risk of recurrence of the cancer following treatment.\n\n\nBreast cancer is usually treated with surgery, which may be followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both. A multidisciplinary approach is preferable.[157] Hormone receptor-positive cancers are often treated with hormone-blocking therapy over courses of several years. Monoclonal antibodies, or other immune-modulating treatments, may be administered in certain cases of metastatic and other advanced stages of breast cancer, although this range of treatment is still being studied.[158]\n\n\n\n### Surgery[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cancer Diagnostic Probe\n\n![](image)Chest after right breast mastectomy\nSurgery involves the physical removal of the tumour, typically along with some of the surrounding tissue. One or more lymph nodes may be biopsied during the surgery; increasingly the lymph node sampling is performed by a sentinel lymph node biopsy.\n\n\nStandard surgeries include:\n\n\n\n* Mastectomy: Removal of the whole breast.\n* Quadrantectomy: Removal of one-quarter of the breast.\n* Lumpectomy: Removal of a small part of the breast.\n\n\nOnce the tumour has been removed, if the person desires, breast reconstruction surgery, a type of plastic surgery, may then be performed to improve the aesthetic appearance of the treated site.\nAlternatively, women use breast prostheses to simulate a breast under clothing, or choose a flat chest. Nipple prosthesis can be used at any time following the mastectomy.\n\n\n\n### Medication[edit]\n\n\nMedications used after and in addition to surgery are called adjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy or other types of therapy prior to surgery are called neoadjuvant therapy. Aspirin may reduce mortality from breast cancer when used with other treatments.[159][160]\n\n\nThere are currently three main groups of medications used for adjuvant breast cancer treatment: hormone-blocking agents, chemotherapy, and monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n\n#### Hormonal therapy[edit]\n\n\nSome breast cancers require estrogen to continue growing. They can be identified by the presence of estrogen receptors (ER+) and progesterone receptors (PR+) on their surface (sometimes referred to together as hormone receptors). These ER+ cancers can be treated with drugs that either block the receptors, e.g. tamoxifen, or alternatively block the production of estrogen with an aromatase inhibitor, e.g. anastrozole[161] or letrozole. The use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years.[162] Tamoxifen increases the risk of postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial polyps, hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer; using tamoxifen with an intrauterine system releasing levonorgestrel might increase vaginal bleeding after one to two years, but reduces somewhat endometrial polyps and hyperplasia, but not necessarily endometrial cancer.[163] Letrozole is recommended for five years.\n\n\nAromatase inhibitors are only suitable for women after menopause; however, in this group, they appear better than tamoxifen.[164] This is because the active aromatase in postmenopausal women is different from the prevalent form in premenopausal women, and therefore these agents are ineffective in inhibiting the predominant aromatase of premenopausal women.[165] Aromatase inhibitors should not be given to premenopausal women with intact ovarian function (unless they are also on treatment to stop their ovaries from working).[166] CDK inhibitors can be used in combination with endocrine or aromatase therapy.[167]\n\n\n\n#### Chemotherapy[edit]\n\n\nChemotherapy is predominantly used for cases of breast cancer in stages 2–4, and is particularly beneficial in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) disease. The chemotherapy medications are administered in combinations, usually for periods of 3–6 months. One of the most common regimens, known as \"AC\", combines cyclophosphamide with doxorubicin. Sometimes a taxane drug, such as docetaxel, is added, and the regime is then known as \"CAT\". Another common treatment is cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (or \"CMF\"). Most chemotherapy medications work by destroying fast-growing and/or fast-replicating cancer cells, either by causing DNA damage upon replication or by other mechanisms. However, the medications also damage fast-growing normal cells, which may cause serious side effects. Damage to the heart muscle is the most dangerous complication of doxorubicin, for example.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Monoclonal antibodies[edit]\n\n\nTrastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody to HER2, has improved the five-year disease free survival of stage 1–3 HER2-positive breast cancers to about 87% (overall survival 95%).[168] Between 25% and 30% of breast cancers overexpress the HER2 gene or its protein product,[169] and overexpression of HER2 in breast cancer is associated with increased disease recurrence and worse prognosis. Trastuzumab, however, is very expensive, and its use may cause serious side effects (approximately 2% of people who receive it develop significant heart damage).[170] Another antibody pertuzumab prevents HER2 dimerization and is recommended together with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in severe disease.[171][172]\n\n\n\n#### Targeted therapy[edit]\n\n\nElacestrant (Orserdu) was approved for medical use in the United States in January 2023.[173][174]\n\n\nCapivasertib (Truqap) was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2023.[175][176][177]\n\n\n\n### Radiation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Internal radiotherapy for breast cancer\nRadiotherapy is given after surgery to the region of the tumour bed and regional lymph nodes, to destroy microscopic tumour cells that may have escaped surgery. When given intraoperatively as targeted intraoperative radiotherapy, it may also have a beneficial effect on tumour microenvironment.[178][179] Radiation therapy can be delivered as external beam radiotherapy or as brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy). Conventionally radiotherapy is given *after* the operation for breast cancer. Radiation can also be given at the time of operation on the breast cancer. Radiation can reduce the risk of recurrence by 50–66% (1/2 – 2/3 reduction of risk) when delivered in the correct dose[180] and is considered essential when breast cancer is treated by removing only the lump (Lumpectomy or Wide local excision). In early breast cancer, partial breast irradiation does not give the same cancer control in the breast as treating the whole breast and may cause worse side effects.[181]\n\n\n\n### Follow-up care[edit]\n\n\nCare after primary breast cancer treatment, otherwise called 'follow-up care', can be intensive involving regular laboratory tests in asymptomatic people to try to achieve earlier detection of possible metastases. A review has found that follow-up programs involving regular physical examinations and yearly mammography alone are as effective as more intensive programs consisting of laboratory tests in terms of early detection of recurrence, overall survival and quality of life.[182]\n\n\nMultidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes, often including exercise, education and psychological help, may produce short-term improvements in functional ability, psychosocial adjustment and social participation in people with breast cancer.[183]\n\n\nUpper limb problems such as shoulder and arm pain, weakness and restricted movement are a common side effect after radiotherapy or breast cancer surgery.[184] According to research in the UK, an exercise programme started 7–10 days after surgery can reduce upper limb problems.[185][186]\n\n\n\n## Prognosis[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Breasts after double mastectomy followed by nipple-sparing reconstruction with implants\n### Prognostic factors[edit]\n\n\n\n\nBreast cancer prognosis by stage[187]\n| Stage | 5-yearsurvival\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Stage I\n | 100%\n |\n| Stage II\n | 90%\n |\n| Stage III\n | 70%\n |\n| Stage IV\n | 30%\n |\n\n\n![](image)An extreme example of an advanced recurrent breast cancer with an ulcerating axillary mass\nThe stage of the breast cancer is the most important component of traditional classification methods of breast cancer, because it has a greater effect on the prognosis than the other considerations. Staging takes into consideration size, local involvement, lymph node status and whether metastatic disease is present. The higher the stage at diagnosis, the poorer the prognosis. The stage is raised by the invasiveness of disease to lymph nodes, chest wall, skin or beyond, and the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. The stage is lowered by the presence of cancer-free zones and close-to-normal cell behaviour (grading). Size is not a factor in staging unless the cancer is invasive. For example, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) involving the entire breast will still be stage zero and consequently an excellent prognosis.\n\n\n\n* Stage 1 cancers (and DCIS, LCIS) have an excellent prognosis and are generally treated with lumpectomy and sometimes radiation.[188]\n* Stage 2 and 3 cancers with a progressively poorer prognosis and greater risk of recurrence are generally treated with surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy with or without lymph node removal), chemotherapy (plus trastuzumab for HER2+ cancers) and sometimes radiation (particularly following large cancers, multiple positive nodes or lumpectomy).[*medical citation needed*]\n* Stage 4, metastatic cancer, (i.e. spread to distant sites) has a poor prognosis and is managed by various combination of all treatments from surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and targeted therapies.\n\n\nThe breast cancer grade is assessed by comparison of the breast cancer cells to normal breast cells. The closer to normal the cancer cells are, the slower their growth and the better the prognosis. If cells are not well differentiated, they will appear immature, will divide more rapidly, and will tend to spread. Well differentiated is given a grade of 1, moderate is grade 2, while poor or undifferentiated is given a higher grade of 3 or 4 (depending upon the scale used). The most widely used grading system is the Nottingham scheme.[189]\n\n\nYounger women with an age of less than 40 years or women over 80 years tend to have a poorer prognosis than post-menopausal women due to several factors. Their breasts may change with their menstrual cycles, they may be nursing infants, and they may be unaware of changes in their breasts. Therefore, younger women are usually at a more advanced stage when diagnosed. There may also be biological factors contributing to a higher risk of disease recurrence for younger women with breast cancer.[190]\n\n\n\n### Psychological aspects[edit]\n\n\nNot all people with breast cancer experience their illness in the same manner. Factors such as age can have a significant impact on the way a person copes with a breast cancer diagnosis. Premenopausal women with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer must confront the issues of early menopause induced by many of the chemotherapy regimens used to treat their breast cancer, especially those that use hormones to counteract ovarian function.[191]\n\n\nIn women with non-metastatic breast cancer, psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy can have positive effects on outcomes such as anxiety, depression and mood disturbance, and can also improve the quality of life.[192] Physical activity interventions may also have beneficial effects on health related quality of life, anxiety, fitness and physical activity in women with breast cancer following adjuvant therapy.[193]\n\n\n\n### Cardiovascular outcomes in breast cancer survivors[edit]\n\n\nWith nearly 3 million BC survivors in the USA,[194] the 5-year survival rate for patients has increased to over 90% thanks to advancements in breast cancer treatment and earlier detection.[195]  Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are becoming more widely acknowledged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality as breast cancer patients live longer.[196]\n\n\nThe recent meta-analysis compared the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in breast cancer patients to the risk in a general matched cancer-free population, and also estimated the incidence of cardiovascular events in BC patients.[197] After analysing data from 26 studies (836,301 patients), the authors found that breast cancer survivors demonstrated a higher risk for cardiovascular death within five years of cancer diagnosis (HR = 1.09; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.11), HF within ten years (HR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.33), and AF within three years (HR = 1.13; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.21).[197]\n\n\nThe epidemiological data from 2,111,882 breast cancer patients revealed that the pooled incidence rates for cardiovascular death was 1.73 (95% CI 1.18, 2.53), 4.44 (95% CI 3.33, 5.92) for heart failure, 4.29 (95% CI 3.09, 5.94) for coronary artery disease, 1.98 (95% CI 1.24, 3.16) for myocardial infarction, 4.33 (95% CI 2.97, 6.30) for stroke of any type, and 2.64 (95% CI 2.97, 6.30) for ischemic stroke per 1000 person-years of follow-up.[197] The study clearly highlighted the crucial need for clinicians to thoroughly examine the cardiovascular risk factor profile of breast cancer survivors and monitor their cardiovascular health.[197]\n\n\n\n## Epidemiology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Epidemiology of breast cancer\n\n![](image)Age-standardized death from breast cancer per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004[198] |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| no data\n <2\n 2–4\n 4–6\n 6–8\n 8–10\n 10–12\n | 12–14\n 14–16\n 16–18\n 18–20\n 20–22\n >22\n |\n\nWorldwide, breast cancer is the most-common invasive cancer in women.[199] Along with lung cancer, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with 2.09 million cases each in 2018.[200] Breast cancer affects 1 in 7 (14%) of women worldwide.[201] (The most common form of cancer is non-invasive non-melanoma skin cancer; non-invasive cancers are generally easily cured, cause very few deaths, and are routinely excluded from cancer statistics.) Breast cancer comprises 22.9% of invasive cancers in women[202] and 16% of all female cancers.[203] In 2012, it comprised 25.2% of cancers diagnosed in women, making it the most-common female cancer.[204]\n\n\nIn 2008, breast cancer caused 458,503 deaths worldwide (13.7% of cancer deaths in women and 6.0% of all cancer deaths for men and women together).[202] Lung cancer, the second most-common cause of cancer-related deaths in women, caused 12.8% of cancer deaths in women (18.2% of all cancer deaths for men and women together).[202]\n\n\nThe incidence of breast cancer varies greatly around the world: it is lowest in less-developed countries and greatest in the more-developed countries. In the twelve world regions, the annual age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 women are as follows: 18 in Eastern Asia, 22 in South Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, 26 in South-Eastern Asia, 26, 28 in North Africa and Western Asia, 42 in South and Central America, 42, 49 in Eastern Europe, 56 in Southern Europe, 73 in Northern Europe, 74 in Oceania, 78 in Western Europe, and 90 in North America.[205] Metastatic breast cancer affects between 19% (United States) and 50% (parts of Africa) of women with breast cancer.[206]\n\n\nThe number of cases worldwide has significantly increased since the 1970s, a phenomenon partly attributed to the modern lifestyles.[207][208] Breast cancer is strongly related to age with only 5% of all breast cancers occurring in women under 40 years old.[209] There were more than 41,000 newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer registered in England in 2011, around 80% of these cases were in women age 50 or older.[210] Based on U.S. statistics in 2015 there were 2.8 million women affected by breast cancer.[199] In the United States, the age-adjusted incidence of breast cancer per 100,000 women rose from around 102 cases per year in the 1970s to around 141 in the late-1990s, and has since fallen, holding steady around 125 since 2003. However, age-adjusted deaths from breast cancer per 100,000 women only rose slightly from 31.4 in 1975 to 33.2 in 1989 and have since declined steadily to 20.5 in 2014.[211]\n\n\n\n## Multiple primary tumours[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Quadrants of breast.\nMultiple primary tumours can arise in different sites (as opposed to a single tumour spreading). These tumours can occur in both breasts (bilateral tumours), in different quadrants of a single breast (multi-centric cancer), or separate tumours within a single breast quadrant (multi-focal cancer).[212][213]\n\n\nIncidence of multi-centric and multi-focal breast cancers (MMBC) is increasing, partly due to improving mammography technology.[214] Incidence of MMBC is reported between 9 and 75% in high income countries, depending on criteria used.[214] For instance, China reported that only 2% of patients are defined as MMBC.[214] The reason for this difference is due to lack of uniformity in diagnosis.[214] Therefore, standardised method and criteria should be made in order to define the incidence of MMBC correctly.[214]\n\n\nMutations in tumour suppressor genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and PTEN can be related to formation of multiple primary breast cancers.[215] Diagnosis occurs via the same modalities as other breast cancers.\n\n\nMastectomy is the standard surgical treatment for multi centric breast cancer patients.[216] Double lumpectomies, also labelled as breast conservative therapy (BCT), is an alternative and preferred surgical treatment to mastectomy for early stage multi centric breast cancer patients.[217] The procedure of double lumpectomies involves the surgical ablation of the cancerous tumour foci and the surrounding breast tissues in different quadrant of the same breast.[217] The benefits of double lumpectomies are the avoidance of breast reconstruction surgery and minimal breast scarring. However, it is not preferred for patients with more than two tumours within the same breast due to difficulty in removing all cancer cells.[218] Patients with multiple primary breast tumours may receive treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and breast reconstruction surgery[218][219] for the same indications as other breast cancer patients.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Breast cancer surgery in 18th century\nBecause of its visibility, breast cancer was the form of cancer most often described in ancient documents.[220]: 9–13 Because autopsies were rare, cancers of the internal organs were essentially invisible to ancient medicine. Breast cancer, however, could be felt through the skin, and in its advanced state often developed into fungating lesions: the tumour would become necrotic (die from the inside, causing the tumour to appear to break up) and ulcerate through the skin, weeping fetid, dark fluid.[220]: 9–13\n\n\nThe oldest discovered evidence of breast cancer is from Egypt and dates back 4200 years, to the Sixth Dynasty.[221] The study of a woman's remains from the necropolis of Qubbet el-Hawa showed the typical destructive damage due to metastatic spread.[221] The Edwin Smith Papyrus describes eight cases of tumours or ulcers of the breast that were treated by cauterization. The writing says about the disease, \"There is no treatment.\"[222] For centuries, physicians described similar cases in their practices, with the same conclusion. Ancient medicine, from the time of the Greeks through the 17th century, was based on humoralism, and thus believed that breast cancer was generally caused by imbalances in the fundamental fluids that controlled the body, especially an excess of black bile.[220]: 32 Alternatively it was seen as divine punishment.[223]\n\n\nMastectomy for breast cancer was performed at least as early as AD 548, when it was proposed by the court physician Aetios of Amida to Theodora.[220]: 9–13 It was not until doctors achieved greater understanding of the circulatory system in the 17th century that they could link breast cancer's spread to the lymph nodes in the armpit. In the early 18th century the French surgeon Jean Louis Petit performed total mastectomies that included removing the axillary lymph nodes, as he recognized that this reduced recurrence.[224] Petit's work built on the methods of the surgeon Bernard Peyrilhe, who in the 17th century additionally removed the pectoral muscle underlying the breast, as he judged that this greatly improved the prognosis.[225] But poor results and the considerable risk to the patient meant that physicians did not share the opinion of surgeons such as Nicolaes Tulp, who in the 17th century proclaimed \"the sole remedy is a timely operation\". The eminent surgeon Richard Wiseman documented in the mid 17th century that following 12 mastectomies, two patients died during the operation, eight patients died shortly after the operation from progressive cancer and only two of the 12 patients were cured.[226]: 6 Physicians were conservative in the treatment they prescribed in the early stages of breast cancer. Patients were treated with a mixture of detox purges, blood letting and traditional remedies that were supposed to lower acidity, such as the alkaline arsenic.[227]: 24\n\n\nWhen in 1664 Anne of Austria was diagnosed with breast cancer, the initial treatment involved compresses saturated with hemlock juice. When the lumps increased the King's physician commenced a treatment with arsenic ointments.[227]: 25 The royal patient died 1666 in atrocious pain.[227]: 26 Each failing treatment for breast cancer led to the search for new treatments, spurring a market in remedies that were advertised and sold by quacks, herbalists, chemists and apothecaries.[228] The lack of anesthesia and antiseptics made mastectomy a painful and dangerous ordeal.[226] In the 18th century, a wide variety of anatomical discoveries were accompanied by new theories about the cause and growth of breast cancer. The investigative surgeon John Hunter claimed that neural fluid generated breast cancer. Other surgeons proposed that milk within the mammary ducts led to cancerous growths. Theories about trauma to the breast as cause for malignant changes in breast tissue were advanced. The discovery of breast lumps and swellings fueled controversies about hard tumours and whether lumps were benign stages of cancer. Medical opinion about necessary immediate treatment varied.[226]: 5 The surgeon Benjamin Bell advocated removal of the entire breast, even when only a portion was affected.[229]\n\n\n\n![](image)Radical mastectomy, Halsted's surgical papers\nBreast cancer was uncommon until the 19th century, when improvements in sanitation and control of deadly infectious diseases resulted in dramatic increases in lifespan. Previously, most women had died too young to have developed breast cancer.[230] In 1878, an article in *Scientific American* described historical treatment by pressure intended to induce local ischemia in cases when surgical removal were not possible.[231] William Stewart Halsted started performing radical mastectomies in 1882, helped greatly by advances in general surgical technology, such as aseptic technique and anesthesia. The Halsted radical mastectomy often involved removing both breasts, associated lymph nodes, and the underlying chest muscles. This often led to long-term pain and disability, but was seen as necessary to prevent the cancer from recurring.[220]: 102–106 Before the advent of the Halsted radical mastectomy, 20-year survival rates were only 10%; Halsted's surgery raised that rate to 50%.[220]: 1\n\n\nBreast cancer staging systems were developed in the 1920s and 1930s to determining the extent to which a cancer has developed by growing and spreading.[220]: 102–106 The first case-controlled study on breast cancer epidemiology was done by Janet Lane-Claypon, who published a comparative study in 1926 of 500 breast cancer cases and 500 controls of the same background and lifestyle for the British Ministry of Health.[232] Radical mastectomies remained the standard of care in the USA until the 1970s, but in Europe, breast-sparing procedures, often followed by radiation therapy, were generally adopted in the 1950s.[220]: 102–106 In 1955 George Crile Jr. published *Cancer and Common Sense* arguing that cancer patients needed to understand available treatment options. Crile became a close friend of the environmentalist Rachel Carson, who had undergone a Halsted radical mastectomy in 1960 to treat her malign breast cancer.[233]: 39–40 The US oncologist Jerome Urban promoted superradical mastectomies, taking even more tissue, until 1963, when the ten-year survival rates proved equal to the less-damaging radical mastectomy.[220]: 102–106 Carson died in 1964 and Crile went on to published a wide variety of articles, both in the popular press and in medical journals, challenging the widespread used of the Halsted radical mastectomy. In 1973 Crile published *What Women Should Know About the Breast Cancer Controversy*. When in 1974 Betty Ford was diagnosed with breast cancer, the options for treating breast cancer were openly discussed in the press.[233]: 58 During the 1970s, a new understanding of metastasis led to perceiving cancer as a systemic illness as well as a localized one, and more sparing procedures were developed that proved equally effective.[234]\n\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, thousands of women who had successfully completed standard treatment then demanded and received high-dose bone marrow transplants, thinking this would lead to better long-term survival. However, it proved completely ineffective, and 15–20% of women died because of the brutal treatment.[235]: 200–203 The 1995 reports from the Nurses' Health Study and the 2002 conclusions of the Women's Health Initiative trial conclusively proved that hormone replacement therapy significantly increased the incidence of breast cancer.[235]\n\n\n\n## Society and culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Breast cancer awareness and List of people with breast cancer\n\nBefore the 20th century, breast cancer was feared and discussed in hushed tones, as if it were shameful. As little could be safely done with primitive surgical techniques, women tended to suffer silently rather than seeking care.[*citation needed*] When surgery advanced, and long-term survival rates improved, women began raising awareness of the disease and the possibility of successful treatment. The \"Women's Field Army\", run by the American Society for the Control of Cancer (later the American Cancer Society) during the 1930s and 1940s was one of the first organized campaigns. In 1952, the first peer-to-peer support group, called \"Reach to Recovery\", began providing post-mastectomy, in-hospital visits from women who had survived breast cancer.[235]: 37–38\n\n\nThe breast cancer movement of the 1980s and 1990s developed out of the larger feminist movements and women's health movement of the 20th century.[235]: 4 This series of political and educational campaigns, partly inspired by the politically and socially effective AIDS awareness campaigns, resulted in the widespread acceptance of second opinions before surgery, less invasive surgical procedures, support groups, and other advances in care.[236]\n\n\n\n### Pink ribbon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The pink ribbon is a symbol to show support for breast cancer awareness.\nMain article: Pink ribbon\n\nA pink ribbon is the most prominent symbol of breast cancer awareness. Pink ribbons, which can be made inexpensively, are sometimes sold as fundraisers, much like poppies on Remembrance Day. They may be worn to honor those who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, or to identify products that the manufacturer would like to sell to consumers that are interested in breast cancer.[235]: 27–72 In the 1990s breast cancer awareness campaigns were launched by US based corporations. As part of these cause related marketing campaigns corporations donated to a variety of breast cancer initiatives for every pink ribbon product that was purchased.[237]>: 132–133 *The Wall Street Journal* noted \"that the strong emotions provoked by breast cancer translate to a company's bottom line\". While many US corporations donated to existing breast cancer initiatives others such as Avon established their own breast cancer foundations on the back of pink ribbon products.[237]: 135–136\n\n\nWearing or displaying a pink ribbon has been criticized by the opponents of this practice as a kind of slacktivism, because it has no practical positive effect. It has also been criticized as hypocrisy, because some people wear the pink ribbon to show good will towards women with breast cancer, but then oppose these women's practical goals, like patient rights and anti-pollution legislation.[235]: 366–368[238] Critics say that the feel-good nature of pink ribbons and pink consumption distracts society from the lack of progress on preventing and curing breast cancer.[235]: 365–366 It is also criticized for reinforcing gender stereotypes and objectifying women and their breasts.<[235]: 372–374 In 2002 Breast Cancer Action launched the \"Think Before You Pink\" campaign against pinkwashing to target businesses that have co-opted the pink campaign to promote products that cause breast cancer, such as alcoholic beverages.[239]\n\n\n\n### Breast cancer culture[edit]\n\n\nIn her 2006 book *Pink Ribbons, Inc.: Breast Cancer and the Politics of Philanthropy* Samantha King claimed that breast cancer has been transformed from a serious disease and individual tragedy to a market-driven industry of survivorship and corporate sales pitch.[240] In 2010 Gayle Sulik argued that the primary purposes or goals of breast cancer culture are to maintain breast cancer's dominance as the pre-eminent women's health issue, to promote the appearance that society is doing something effective about breast cancer, and to sustain and expand the social, political, and financial power of breast cancer activists.[235]: 57 In the same year Barbara Ehrenreich published an opinion piece in *Harper's Magazine*, lamenting that in breast cancer culture, breast cancer therapy is viewed as a rite of passage rather than a disease. To fit into this mold, the woman with breast cancer needs to normalize and feminize her appearance, and minimize the disruption that her health issues cause anyone else. Anger, sadness, and negativity must be silenced. As with most cultural models, people who conform to the model are given social status, in this case as cancer survivors. Women who reject the model are shunned, punished and shamed. The culture is criticized for treating adult women like little girls, as evidenced by \"baby\" toys such as pink teddy bears given to adult women.[241]\n\n\n\n### Emphasis[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009 the US science journalist Christie Aschwanden criticized that the emphasis on breast cancer screening may be harming women by subjecting them to unnecessary radiation, biopsies, and surgery. One-third of diagnosed breast cancers might recede on their own.[242] Screening mammography efficiently finds non-life-threatening, asymptomatic breast cancers and precancers, even while overlooking serious cancers. According to the cancer researcher H. Gilbert Welch, screening mammography has taken the \"brain-dead approach that says the best test is the one that finds the most cancers\" rather than the one that finds dangerous cancers.[242]\n\n\nIn 2002 it was noted that as a result of breast cancer's high visibility, the statistical results can be misinterpreted, such as the claim that one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lives – a claim that depends on the unrealistic assumption that no woman will die of any other disease before the age of 95.[220]: 199–200 By 2010 the breast cancer survival rate in Europe was 91% at one years and 65% at five years. In the USA the five-year survival rate for localized breast cancer was 96.8%, while in cases of metastases it was only 20.6%. Because the prognosis for breast cancer was at this stage relatively favorable, compared to the prognosis for other cancers, breast cancer as cause of death among women was 13.9% of all cancer deaths. The second most common cause of death from cancer in women was lung cancer, the most common cancer worldwide for men and women. The improved survival rate made breast cancer the most prevalent cancer in the world. In 2010 an estimated 3.6 million women worldwide have had a breast cancer diagnosis in the past five years, while only 1.4 million male or female survivors from lung cancer were alive.[243]\n\n\n\n## Health disparities in breast cancer[edit]\n\n\nThere are ethnic disparities in the mortality rates for breast cancer as well as in breast cancer treatment. Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer affecting women of every ethnic group in the United States. Breast cancer incidence among black women aged 45 and older is higher than that of white women in the same age group. White women aged 60–84 have higher incidence rates of breast cancer than Black women. Despite this, Black women at every age are more likely to succumb to breast cancer.[244]\n\n\nBreast cancer treatment has improved greatly in recent years, but black women are still less likely to obtain treatment compared to white women.[244] Risk factors such as socioeconomic status, late-stage, or breast cancer at diagnosis, genetic differences in tumour subtypes, differences in health care access all contribute to these disparities. Socioeconomic determinants affecting the disparity in breast cancer illness include poverty, culture, as well as social injustice. In Hispanic women, the incidence of breast cancer is lower than in non-Hispanic women but is often diagnosed at a later stage than white women with larger tumors.\n\n\nBlack women are usually diagnosed with breast cancer at a younger age than white women. The median age of diagnosis for Black women is 59, in comparison to 62 in White women. The incidence of breast cancer in Black women has increased by 0.4% per year since 1975 and 1.5% per year among Asian/Pacific Islander women since 1992. Incidence rates were stable for non-Hispanic White, Hispanics, and Native women. The five-year survival rate is noted to be 81% in Black women and 92% in White women. Chinese and Japanese women have the highest survival rates.[244]\n\n\nPoverty is a major driver for disparities related to breast cancer. Low-income women are less likely to undergo breast cancer screening and thus are more likely to have a late-stage diagnosis.[244] Ensuring women of all ethnic groups receive equitable health care including breast screening, can positively affect these disparities.[245]\n\n\n\n## Pregnancy[edit]\n\n\nPregnancy at an early age decreases the risk of developing breast cancer later in life.[246] The risk of breast cancer also declines with the number of children a woman has.[246] Breast cancer then becomes more common in the 5 or 10 years following pregnancy but then becomes less common than among the general population.[247] These cancers are known as postpartum breast cancer and have worse outcomes including an increased risk of distant spread of disease and mortality.[248] Other cancers found during or shortly after pregnancy appear at approximately the same rate as other cancers in women of a similar age.[249]\n\n\nDiagnosing new cancer in a pregnant woman is difficult, in part because any symptoms are commonly assumed to be a normal discomfort associated with pregnancy.[249] As a result, cancer is typically discovered at a somewhat later stage than average in many pregnant or recently pregnant women. Some imaging procedures, such as MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging), CT scans, ultrasounds, and mammograms with fetal shielding are considered safe during pregnancy; some others, such as PET scans are not.[249]\n\n\nTreatment is generally the same as for non-pregnant women.[249] However, radiation is normally avoided during pregnancy, especially if the fetal dose might exceed 100 cGy. In some cases, some or all treatments are postponed until after birth if the cancer is diagnosed late in the pregnancy. Early deliveries to speed the start of treatment are not uncommon. Surgery is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but some other treatments, especially certain chemotherapy drugs given during the first trimester, increase the risk of birth defects and pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortions and stillbirths).[249] Elective abortions are not required and do not improve the likelihood of the mother surviving or being cured.[249]\n\n\nRadiation treatments may interfere with the mother's ability to breastfeed her baby because it reduces the ability of that breast to produce milk and increases the risk of mastitis. Also, when chemotherapy is being given after birth, many of the drugs pass through breast milk to the baby, which could harm the baby.[249]\n\n\nRegarding future pregnancy among breast cancer survivors, there is often fear of cancer recurrence.[250] On the other hand, many still regard pregnancy and parenthood to represent normality, happiness and life fulfillment.[250]\n\n\n\n## Hormones[edit]\n\n\n### Birth control[edit]\n\n\nIn breast cancer survivors, non-hormonal birth control methods such as the copper intrauterine device (IUD) should be used as first-line options.[251] Progestogen-based methods such as depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, IUD with progestogen or progestogen only pills have a poorly investigated but possible increased risk of cancer recurrence, but may be used if positive effects outweigh this possible risk.[252]\n\n\n\n### Menopausal hormone replacement[edit]\n\n\nIn breast cancer survivors, it is recommended to first consider non-hormonal options for menopausal effects, such as bisphosphonates or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for osteoporosis, and vaginal estrogen for local symptoms. Observational studies of systemic hormone replacement therapy after breast cancer are generally reassuring. If hormone replacement is necessary after breast cancer, estrogen-only therapy or estrogen therapy with an intrauterine device with progestogen may be safer options than combined systemic therapy.[253]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nTreatments are being evaluated in clinical trials. This includes individual drugs, combinations of drugs, and surgical and radiation techniques Investigations include new types of targeted therapy,[254] cancer vaccines, oncolytic virotherapy,[255] gene therapy[256][257] and immunotherapy.[258]\n\n\nThe latest research is reported annually at scientific meetings such as that of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium,[259] and the St. Gallen Oncology Conference in St. Gallen, Switzerland.[260] These studies are reviewed by professional societies and other organizations, and formulated into guidelines for specific treatment groups and risk category.\n\n\nFenretinide, a retinoid, is also being studied as a way to reduce the risk of breast cancer.[261][262] In particular, combinations of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy have been the subject of clinical trials.[263]\n\n\nA 2019 review found moderate certainty evidence that giving people antibiotics before breast cancer surgery helped to prevent surgical site infection (SSI). Further study is required to determine the most effective antibiotic protocol and use in women undergoing immediate breast reconstruction.[264]\n\n\n\n### Cryoablation[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2014 cryoablation is being studied to see if it could be a substitute for a lumpectomy in small cancers.[265] There is tentative evidence in those with tumours less than 2 centimeters.[266] It may also be used in those in who surgery is not possible.[266] Another review states that cryoablation looks promising for early breast cancer of small size.[267]\n\n\n\n### Breast cancer cell lines[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of breast cancer cell lines\n\nPart of the current knowledge on breast carcinomas is based on in vivo and in vitro studies performed with cell lines derived from breast cancers. These provide an unlimited source of homogenous self-replicating material, free of contaminating stromal cells, and often easily cultured in simple standard media. The first breast cancer cell line described, BT-20, was established in 1958. Since then, and despite sustained work in this area, the number of permanent lines obtained has been strikingly low (about 100). Indeed, attempts to culture breast cancer cell lines from primary tumours have been largely unsuccessful. This poor efficiency was often due to technical difficulties associated with the extraction of viable tumour cells from their surrounding stroma. Most of the available breast cancer cell lines issued from metastatic tumours, mainly from pleural effusions. Effusions provided generally large numbers of dissociated, viable tumour cells with little or no contamination by fibroblasts and other tumour stroma cells.\nMany of the currently used BCC lines were established in the late 1970s. A very few of them, namely MCF-7, T-47D, MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3, account for more than two-thirds of all abstracts reporting studies on mentioned breast cancer cell lines, as concluded from a Medline-based survey.\n\n\n\n### Molecular markers[edit]\n\n\n#### Metabolic markers[edit]\n\n\nClinically, the most useful metabolic markers in breast cancer are the estrogen and progesterone receptors that are used to predict response to hormone therapy. New or potentially new markers for breast cancer include BRCA1 and BRCA2[268] to identify people at high risk of developing breast cancer, HER-2,[*medical citation needed*] and SCD1, for predicting response to therapeutic regimens, and urokinase plasminogen activator, PA1-1 and SCD1 for assessing prognosis.[*medical citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Other animals[edit]\n\n\n* Mammary tumor for breast cancer in other animals\n* Mouse models of breast cancer metastasis\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** \"Breast Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)\". *NCI*. 23 May 2014.

Lung cancer is caused by genetic damage to the DNA of cells in the airways, often caused by cigarette smoking or inhaling damaging chemicals. Damaged airway cells gain the ability to multiply unchecked, causing the growth of a tumor. Without treatment, tumors spread throughout the lung, damaging lung function. Eventually lung tumors metastasize, spreading to other parts of the body. \n\n\nEarly lung cancer often has no symptoms and can only be detected by medical imaging. As the cancer progresses, most people experience nonspecific respiratory problems: coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Other symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor. Those suspected of having lung cancer typically undergo a series of imaging tests to determine the location and extent of any tumors. Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires a biopsy of the suspected tumor be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. In addition to recognizing cancerous cells, a pathologist can classify the tumor according to the type of cells it originates from. Around 15% of cases are small-cell lung cancer, and the remaining 85% (the non-small-cell lung cancers) are adenocarcinomas, squamous-cell carcinomas, and large-cell carcinomas. After diagnosis, further imaging and biopsies are done to determine the cancer's stage based on how far it has spread.\n\n\nTreatment for early stage lung cancer includes surgery to remove the tumor, sometimes followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells. Later stage cancer is treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy alongside drug treatments that target specific cancer subtypes. Even with treatment, only around 20% of people survive five years on from their diagnosis.[4] Survival rates are higher in those diagnosed at an earlier stage, diagnosed at a younger age, and in women compared to men.\n\n\nMost lung cancer cases are caused by tobacco smoking. The remainder are caused by exposure to hazardous substances like asbestos and radon gas, or by genetic mutations that arise by chance. Consequently, lung cancer prevention efforts encourage people to avoid hazardous chemicals and quit smoking. Quitting smoking both reduces one's chance of developing lung cancer and improves treatment outcomes in those already diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\n\nLung cancer is the most diagnosed and deadliest cancer worldwide, with 2.2 million cases in 2020 resulting in 1.8 million deaths.[3] Lung cancer is rare in those younger than 40; the average age at diagnosis is 70 years, and the average age at death 72.[2] Incidence and outcomes vary widely across the world, depending on patterns of tobacco use. Prior to the advent of cigarette smoking in the 20th century, lung cancer was a rare disease. In the 1950s and 1960s, increasing evidence linked lung cancer and tobacco use, culminating in declarations by most large national health bodies discouraging tobacco use.\n\n\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms[edit]\n\n\nEarly lung cancer often has no symptoms. When symptoms do arise they are often nonspecific respiratory problems – coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain – that can differ from person to person.[5] Those who experience coughing tend to report either a new cough, or an increase in the frequency or strength of a pre-existing cough.[5] Around one in four cough up blood, ranging from small streaks in the sputum to large amounts.[6][5] Around half of those diagnosed with lung cancer experience shortness of breath, while 25–50% experience a dull, persistent chest pain that remains in the same location over time.[5] In addition to respiratory symptoms, some experience systemic symptoms including loss of appetite, weight loss, general weakness, fever, and night sweats.[5][7]\n\n\nSome less common symptoms suggest tumors in particular locations. Tumors in the thorax can cause breathing problems by obstructing the trachea or disrupting the nerve to the diaphragm; difficulty swallowing by compressing the esophagus; hoarseness by disrupting the nerves of the larynx; and Horner's syndrome by disrupting the sympathetic nervous system.[5][7] Horner's syndrome is also common in tumors at the top of the lung, known as Pancoast tumors, which also cause shoulder pain that radiates down the little-finger side of the arm as well as destruction of the topmost ribs.[7] Swollen lymph nodes above the collarbone can indicate a tumor that has spread within the chest.[5] Tumors obstructing bloodflow to the heart can cause superior vena cava syndrome (swelling of the upper body and shortness of breath), while tumors infiltrating the area around the heart can cause fluid buildup around the heart, arrythmia (irregular heartbeat), and heart failure.[7]\n\n\nAbout one in three people diagnosed with lung cancer have symptoms caused by metastases in sites other than the lungs.[7] Lung cancer can metastasize anywhere in the body, with different symptoms depending on the location. Brain metastases can cause headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and neurological deficits. Bone metastases can cause pain, bone fractures, and compression of the spinal cord. Metastasis into the bone marrow can deplete blood cells and cause leukoerythroblastosis (immature cells in the blood).[7] Liver metastases can cause liver enlargement, pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, fever, and weight loss.[7]\n\n\nLung tumors often cause the release of body-altering hormones, which cause unusual symptoms, called paraneoplastic syndromes.[7] Inappropriate hormone release can cause dramatic shifts in concentrations of blood minerals. Most common is hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) caused by over-production of parathyroid hormone-related protein or parathyroid hormone. Hypercalcemia can manifest as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, increased thirst, frequent urination, and altered mental status.[7] Those with lung cancer also commonly experience hypokalemia (low potassium) due to inappropriate secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone, as well as hyponatremia (low sodium) due to overproduction of antidiuretic hormone or atrial natriuretic peptide.[7] About one of three people with lung cancer develop nail clubbing, while up to one in ten experience hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (nail clubbing, joint soreness, and skin thickening). A variety of autoimmune disorders can arise as paraneoplastic syndromes in those with lung cancer, including Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (which causes muscle weakness), sensory neuropathies, muscle inflammation, brain swelling, and autoimmune deterioration of cerebellum, limbic system, or brainstem.[7] Up to one in twelve people with lung cancer have paraneoplastic blood clotting, including migratory venous thrombophlebitis, clots in the heart, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (clots throughout the body).[7] Paraneoplastic syndromes involving the skin and kidneys are rare, each occurring in up to 1% of those with lung cancer.[7]\n\n\n\n## Diagnosis[edit]\n\n\n![CT scan of lung, with tumor appearing as a sharp white shape](image)CT scan showing a cancerous tumor in the left lung\nA person suspected of having lung cancer will have imaging tests done to evaluate the presence, extent, and location of tumors. First, many primary care providers perform a chest X-ray to look for a mass inside the lung.[8] The X-ray may reveal an obvious mass, the widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (lung collapse), consolidation (pneumonia), or pleural effusion;[9] however, some lung tumors are not visible by X-ray.[5] Next, many undergo computed tomography (CT) scanning, which can reveal the sizes and locations of tumors.[8][10]\n\n\nA definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires a biopsy of the suspected tissue be histologically examined for cancer cells.[11] Given the location of lung cancer tumors, biopsies can often be obtained by minimally invasive techniques: a fiberoptic bronchoscope that can retrieve tissue (sometimes guided by endobronchial ultrasound), fine needle aspiration, or other imaging-guided biopsy through the skin.[11] Those who cannot undergo a typical biopsy procedure may instead have a liquid biopsy taken (that is, a sample of some body fluid) which may contain circulating tumor DNA that can be detected.[12]\n\n\n\n![Diagram of a machine attached to a tube running down a person's mouth and into their trachea and bronchi](image)Diagram showing a bronchoscopy\nImaging is also used to assess the extent of cancer spread. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning or combined PET-CT scanning is often used to locate metastases in the body. Since PET scanning is less sensitive in the brain, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – or CT where MRI is unavailable – to scan the brain for metastases in those with NSCLC and large tumors, or tumors that have spread to the nearby lymph nodes.[13] When imaging suggests the tumor has spread, the suspected metastasis is often biopsied to confirm that it is cancerous.[11] Lung cancer most commonly metastasizes to the brain, bones, liver, and adrenal glands.[14]\n\n\nLung cancer can often appear as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan. In lung cancer screening studies as many as 30% of those screened have a lung nodule, the majority of which turn out to be benign.[15] Besides lung cancer many other diseases can also give this appearance, including hamartomas, and infectious granulomas caused by tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, or coccidioidomycosis.[16]\n\n\n\n### Classification[edit]\n\n\n![Microscope images of lung tissue. At top-left, healthy lung with clear air-filled alveoli. Others are full of tumor or material, per caption.](image)H&E stained samples from lung biopsies: (Top-left) Normal bronchiole surrounded by alveoli, (top-right) adenocarcinoma with papillary (finger-like) growth, (bottom-left) alveoli filled with mucin suggesting adenocarcinoma nearby, (bottom-right) squamous-cell carcinoma, with alveoli full of keratin.\nAt diagnosis, lung cancer is classified based on the type of cells the tumor is derived from; tumors derived from different cells progress and respond to treatment differently. There are two main types of lung cancer, categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a microscope: small cell lung cancer (SCLC; 15% of cases) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 85% of cases).[17] SCLC tumors are often found near the center of the lungs, in the major airways.[18] Their cells appear small with ill-defined boundaries, not much cytoplasm, many mitochondria, and have distinctive nuclei with granular-looking chromatin and no visible nucleoli.[19] NSCLCs comprise a group of three cancer types: adenocarcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma.[19] Nearly 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinomas.[20] Their cells grow in three-dimensional clumps, resemble glandular cells, and may produce mucin.[19] About 30% of lung cancers are squamous-cell carcinomas. They typically occur close to large airways.[20] The tumors consist of sheets of cells, with layers of keratin.[19] A hollow cavity and associated cell death are commonly found at the center of the tumor.[20] Less than 10% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinomas,[19] so named because the cells are large, with excess cytoplasm, large nuclei, and conspicuous nucleoli.[20] Around 10% of lung cancers are rarer types.[19] These include mixes of the above subtypes like adenosquamous carcinoma, and rare subtypes such as carcinoid tumors, and sarcomatoid carcinomas.[20]\n\n\nSeveral lung cancer types are subclassified based on the growth characteristics of the cancer cells. Adenocarcinomas are classified as lepidic (growing along the surface of intact alveolar walls),[21] acinar and papillary, or micropapillary and solid pattern. Lepidic adenocarcinomas tend to be least aggressive, while micropapillary and solid pattern adenocarcinomas are most aggressive.[22]\n\n\nIn addition to examining cell morphology, biopsies are often stained by immunohistochemistry to confirm lung cancer classification. SCLCs bear the markers of neuroendocrine cells, such as chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56.[23] Adenocarcinomas tend to express Napsin-A and TTF-1; squamous cell carcinomas lack Napsin-A and TTF-1, but express p63 and its cancer-specific isoform p40.[19] CK7 and CK20 are also commonly used to differentiate lung cancers. CK20 is found in several cancers, but typically absent from lung cancer. CK7 is present in many lung cancers, but absent from squamous cell carcinomas.[24]\n\n\n\n### Staging[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lung cancer staging\n\n\n\nStage group according to TNM classification in lung cancer[25]\n| TNM\n | Stage group\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| T1a N0 M0\n | IA1\n |\n| T1b N0 M0\n | IA2\n |\n| T1c N0 M0\n | IA3\n |\n| T2a N0 M0\n | IB\n |\n| T2b N0 M0\n | IIA\n |\n| T1–T2 N1 M0\n | IIB\n |\n| T3 N0 M0\n |\n| T1–T2 N2 M0\n | IIIA\n |\n| T3 N1 M0\n |\n| T4 N0–N1 M0\n |\n| T1–T2 N3 M0\n | IIIB\n |\n| T3–T4 N2 M0\n |\n| T3–T4 N3 M0\n | IIIC\n |\n| Any T, any N, M1a–M1b\n | IVA\n |\n| Any T, any N, M1c\n | IVB\n |\n\n\nLung cancer staging is an assessment of the degree of spread of the cancer from its original source. It is one of the factors affecting both the prognosis and the treatment of lung cancer.[26]\n\n\nSCLC is typically staged with a relatively simple system: limited stage or extensive stage. Around a third of people are diagnosed at the limited stage, meaning cancer is confined to one side of the chest, within the scope of a single radiotherapy field.[26] The other two thirds are diagnosed at the \"extensive stage\", with cancer spread to both sides of the chest, or to other parts of the body.[26]\n\n\nNSCLC – and sometimes SCLC – is typically staged with the American Joint Committee on Cancer's Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system.[27] The size and extent of the tumor (T), spread to regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M) are scored individually, and combined to form stage groups.[28]\n\n\nRelatively small tumors are designated T1, which are subdivided by size: tumors ≤ 1 centimeter (cm) across are T1a; 1–2 cm T1b; 2–3 cm T1c. Tumors up to 5 cm across, or those that have spread to the visceral pleura (tissue covering the lung) or main bronchi, are designated T2. T2a designates 3–4 cm tumors; T2b 4–5 cm tumors. T3 tumors are up to 7 cm across, have multiple nodules in the same lobe of the lung, or invade the chest wall, diaphragm (or the nerve that controls it), or area around the heart.[28][29] Tumors that are larger than 7 cm, have nodules spread in different lobes of a lung, or invade the mediastinum (center of the chest cavity), heart, largest blood vessels that supply the heart, trachea, esophagus, or spine are designated T4.[28][29] Lymph node staging depends on the extent of local spread: with the cancer metastasized to no lymph nodes (N0), pulmonary or hilar nodes (along the bronchi) on the same side as the tumor (N1), mediastinal or subcarinal lymph nodes (in the middle of the lungs, N2), or lymph nodes on the opposite side of the lung from the tumor (N3).[29] Metastases are staged as no metastases (M0), nearby metastases (M1a; the space around the lung or the heart, or the opposite lung), a single distant metastasis (M1b), or multiple metastases (M1c).[28]\n\n\nThese T, N, and M scores are combined to designate a stage grouping for the cancer. Cancer limited to smaller tumors is designated stage I. Disease with larger tumors or spread to the nearest lymph nodes is stage II. Cancer with the largest tumors or extensive lymph node spread is stage III. Cancer that has metastasized is stage IV. Each stage is further subdivided based on the combination of T, N, and M scores.[30]\n\n\n\n\n\nTNM classification in lung cancer[31]\n| \n\n| T: Primary tumor\n |\n| --- |\n| T0\n | No primary tumor\n |\n| Tis\n | Carcinoma in situ |\n| T1\n | Tumor ≤ 3 cm across, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura\n |\n|  | T1mi\n | Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma\n |\n| T1a\n | Tumor ≤ 1 cm across\n |\n| T1b\n | Tumor > 1 cm but ≤ 2 cm across\n |\n| T1c\n | Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 3 cm across\n |\n| T2\n | Any of:\n | Tumor size > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm across\n |\n| Involvement of the main bronchus but not the carina\n |\n| Invasion of visceral pleura\n |\n| Atelectasis/obstructive pneumonitis extending to the hilum |\n|  | T2a\n | Tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 4 cm across\n |\n| T2b\n | Tumor > 4 cm but ≤ 5 cm across\n |\n| T3\n | Any of:\n | Tumor size > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm across\n |\n| Invasion into the chest wall, phrenic nerve, or parietal pericardium |\n| Separate tumor nodule in the same lobe\n |\n| T4\n | Any of:\n | Tumor size > 7 cm\n |\n| Invasion of the diaphragm, mediastinum, heart, great vessels, trachea, carina, recurrent laryngeal nerve, esophagus, or vertebral body |\n| Separate tumor nodule in a different lobe of the same lung\n |\n\n | \n\n| N: Lymph nodes\n |\n| --- |\n| N0\n | No lymph node metastasis\n |\n| N1\n | Metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial or hilar lymph nodes\n |\n| N2\n | Metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal lymph nodes\n |\n| N3\n | Any of:\n | Metastasis to scalene or supraclavicular lymph nodes\n |\n| Metastasis to contralateral hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes\n |\n\n | \n\n| M: Metastasis\n |\n| --- |\n| M0\n | No distant metastasis\n |\n| M1a\n | Any of:\n | Separate tumor nodule in the other lung\n |\n| Tumor with pleural or pericardial nodules\n |\n| Malignant pleural or pericardial effusion |\n| M1b\n | A single metastasis outside the chest\n |\n| M1c\n | Two or more metastases outside the chest\n |\n\n |\n\n\n### Screening[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lung cancer screening\n\nSome countries recommend that people who are at a high risk of developing lung cancer be screened at different intervals using low-dose CT lung scans. Screening programs may result in early detection of lung tumors in people who are not yet experiencing symptoms of lung cancer, ideally, early enough that the tumors can be successfully treated and result in decreased mortality.[32] There is evidence that regular low-dose CT scans in people at high risk of developing lung cancer reduces total lung cancer deaths by as much as 20%.[15] Despite evidence of benefit in these populations, potential harms of screening include the potential for a person to have a 'false positive' screening result that may lead to unnecessary testing, invasive procedures, and distress.[33] Although rare, there is also a risk of radiation-induced cancer.[33] The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends yearly screening using low-dose CT in people between 55 and 80 who have a smoking history of at least 30 pack-years.[34] The European Commission recommends that cancer screening programs across the European Union be extended to include low-dose CT lung scans for current or previous smokers.[35] Similarly, The Canadian Task Force for Preventative Health recommends that people who are current or former smokers (smoking history of more than 30 pack years) and who are between the ages of 55–74 years be screened for lung cancer.[36]\n\n\n\n## Treatment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Treatment of lung cancer\n\nTreatment for lung cancer depends on the cancer's specific cell type, how far it has spread, and the person's health. Common treatments for early stage cancer includes surgical removal of the tumor, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. For later-stage cancer, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are combined with newer targeted molecular therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors.[4] All lung cancer treatment regimens are combined with lifestyle changes and palliative care to improve quality of life.[37]\n\n\n\n### Small-cell lung cancer[edit]\n\n\n![A person lays on a table under a large machine.](image)Setup for radiation therapy. The person lies flat while a radiation beam is focused on the tumor site\nLimited-stage SCLC is typically treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.[38] For chemotherapy, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend four to six cycles of a platinum-based chemotherapeutic – cisplatin or carboplatin – combined with either etoposide or irinotecan.[39] This is typically combined with thoracic radiation therapy – 45 Gray (Gy) twice-daily – alongside the first two chemotherapy cycles.[38] First-line therapy causes remission in up to 80% of those who receive it; however most people relapse with chemotherapy-resistant disease. Those who relapse are given second-line chemotherapies. Topotecan and lurbinectedin are approved by the US FDA for this purpose.[38] Irinotecan, paclitaxel, docetaxel, vinorelbine, etoposide, and gemcitabine are also sometimes used, and are similarly efficacious.[38] Prophylactic cranial irradiation can reduce the risk of brain metastases and improve survival in those with limited-stage disease.[40][38]\n\n\nExtensive-stage SCLC is treated first with etoposide along with either cisplatin or carboplatin. Radiotherapy is used only to shrink tumors that are causing particularly severe symptoms. Combining standard chemotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor can improve survival for a minority of those affected, extending the average person's lifespan by around 2 months.[41]\n\n\n\n### Non-small-cell lung cancer[edit]\n\n\n![A lung showing a small tumor. Increasingly large pieces are removed for wedge resection, segmentectomy, and lobectomy respectively](image)The extent of common surgeries to remove a lung tumor (shown in black). Areas that are surgically removed along with the tumor are shown in blue.\nFor stage I and stage II NSCLC the first line of treatment is often surgical removal of the affected lobe of the lung.[42] For those not well enough to tolerate full lobe removal, a smaller chunk of lung tissue can be removed by wedge resection or segmentectomy surgery.[42] Those with centrally located tumors and otherwise-healthy respiratory systems may have more extreme surgery to remove an entire lung (pneumonectomy).[42] Experienced thoracic surgeons, and a high-volume surgery clinic improve chances of survival.[42] Those who are unable or unwilling to undergo surgery can instead receive radiation therapy. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is best practice, typically administered several times over 1–2 weeks.[42] Chemotherapy has little effect in those with stage I NSCLC, and may worsen disease outcomes in those with the earliest disease. In those with stage II disease, chemotherapy is usually initiated six to twelve weeks after surgery, with up to four cycles of cisplatin – or carboplatin in those with kidney problems, neuropathy, or hearing impairment – combined with vinorelbine, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, or docetaxel.[42]\n\n\nTreatment for those with stage III NSCLC depends on the nature of their disease. Those with more limited spread may undergo surgery to have the tumor and affected lymph nodes removed, followed by chemotherapy and potentially radiotherapy. Those with particularly large tumors (T4) and those for whom surgery is impractical are treated with combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy along with the immunotherapy durvalumab.[43] Combined chemotherapy and radiation enhances survival compared to chemotherapy followed by radiation, though the combination therapy comes with harsher side effects.[43]\n\n\nThose with stage IV disease are treated with combinations of pain medication, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy.[44] Many cases of advanced disease can be treated with targeted therapies depending on the genetic makeup of the cancerous cells. Up to 30% of tumors have mutations in the *EGFR* gene that result in an overactive EGFR protein;[45] these can be treated with EGFR inhibitors osimertinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, or dacomitinib – with osimertinib known to be superior to erlotinib and gefitinib, and all superior to chemotherapy alone.[44] Up to 7% of those with NSCLC harbor mutations that result in hyperactive ALK protein, which can be treated with ALK inhibitors crizotinib, or its successors alectinib, brigatinib, and ceritinib.[44] Those treated with ALK inhibitors who relapse can then be treated with the third-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib.[44] Up to 5% with NSCLC have overactive MET, which can be inhibited with MET inhibitors capmatinib or tepotinib.[44] Targeted therapies are also available for some cancers with rare mutations. Cancers with hyperactive BRAF (around 2% of NSCLC) can be treated by dabrafenib combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib; those with activated ROS1 (around 1% of NSCLC) can be inhibited by crizotinib, lorlatinib, or entrectinib; overactive NTRK (<1% of NSCLC) by entrectinib or larotrectinib; active RET (around 1% of NSCLC) by selpercatinib.[44]\n\n\nPeople whose NSCLC is not targetable by current molecular therapies instead can be treated with combination chemotherapy plus immune checkpoint inhibitors, which prevent cancer cells from inactivating immune T cells. The chemotherapeutic agent of choice depends on the NSCLC subtype: cisplatin plus gemcitabine for squamous cell carcinoma, cisplatin plus pemetrexed for non-squamous cell carcinoma.[46] Immune checkpoint inhibitors are most effective against tumors that express the protein PD-L1, but are sometimes effective in those that do not.[47] Treatment with pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or combination nivolumab plus ipilimumab are all superior to chemotherapy alone against tumors expressing PD-L1.[47] Those who relapse on the above are treated with second-line chemotherapeutics docetaxel and ramucirumab.[48]\n\n\n\n### Palliative care[edit]\n\n\n![A machine attached to a tube that goes into a person's mouth and into a bronchus. At the end, an object emits radiation at a lung tumor.](image)Brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy) for lung cancer given via the airway\nIntegrating palliative care (medical care focused on improving symptoms and lessening discomfort) into lung cancer treatment from the time of diagnosis improves the survival time and quality of life of those with lung cancer.[49] Particularly common symptoms of lung cancer are shortness of breath and pain. Supplemental oxygen, improved airflow, re-orienting an affected person in bed, and low-dose morphine can all improve shortness of breath.[50] In around 20 to 30% of those with lung cancer – particularly those with late-stage disease – growth of the tumor can narrow or block the airway, causing coughing and difficulty breathing.[51] Obstructing tumors can be surgically removed where possible, though typically those with airway obstruction are not well enough for surgery. In such cases the American College of Chest Physicians recommends opening the airway by inserting a stent, attempting to shrink the tumor with localized radiation (brachytherapy), or physically removing the blocking tissue by bronchoscopy, sometimes aided by thermal or laser ablation.[52] Other causes of lung cancer-associated shortness of breath can be treated directly, such as antibiotics for a lung infection, diuretics for pulmonary edema, benzodiazepines for anxiety, and steroids for airway obstruction.[50]\n\n\nUp to 92% of those with lung cancer report pain, either from tissue damage at the tumor site(s) or nerve damage.[53] The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a three-tiered system for managing cancer pain. For those with mild pain (tier one), the WHO recommends acetominophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.[53] Around a third of people experience moderate (tier two) or severe (tier three) pain, for which the WHO recommends opioid painkillers.[53] Opioids are typically effective at easing nociceptive pain (pain caused by damage to various body tissues). Opioids are occasionally effective at easing neuropathic pain (pain cauesd by nerve damage). Neuropathic agents such as anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, are often used to ease neuropathic pain, either alone or in combination with opioids.[53] In many cases, targeted radiotherapy can be used to shrink tumors, reducing pain and other symptoms caused by tumor growth.[54]\n\n\nIndividuals who have advanced disease and are approaching end-of-life can benefit from dedicated end-of-life care to manage symptoms and ease suffering. As in earlier disease, pain and difficulty breathing are common, and can be managed with opioid pain medications, transitioning from oral medication to injected medication if the affected individual loses the ability to swallow.[55][56] Coughing is also common, and can be managed with opioids or cough suppressants. Some experience terminal delirium – confused behavior, unexplained movements, or a reversal of the sleep-wake cycle – which can be managed by antipsychotic drugs, low-dose sedatives, and investigating other causes of discomfort such as low blood sugar, constipation, and sepsis.[55] In the last few days of life, many develop terminal secretions – pooled fluid in the airways that can cause a rattling sound while breathing. This is thought not to cause respiratory problems, but can distress family members and caregivers. Terminal secretions can be reduced by anticholinergic medications.[55] Even those who are non-communicative or have reduced consciousness may be able to experience cancer-related pain, so pain medications are typically continued until the time of death.[55]\n\n\n\n## Prognosis[edit]\n\n\n![Graph showing five-year survival from lung cancer increasing from 1975 (11.7% of people) to 2015 (25.2%).](image)Percent of people who survive five years from a lung cancer diagnosis over time, according to the NIH SEER program\n\n\nFive-year survival in those diagnosed with lung cancer, by stage[57]\n| Clinical stage\n | Five-year survival (%)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| IA1\n | 92\n |\n| IA2\n | 83\n |\n| IA3\n | 77\n |\n| IB\n | 68\n |\n| IIA\n | 60\n |\n| IIB\n | 53\n |\n| IIIA\n | 36\n |\n| IIIB\n | 26\n |\n| IIIC\n | 13\n |\n| IVA\n | 10\n |\n| IVB\n | 0\n |\n\n\nAround 19% of people diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years from diagnosis, though prognosis varies based on the stage of the disease at diagnosis and the type of lung cancer.[4] Prognosis is better for people with lung cancer diagnosed at an earlier stage; those diagnosed at the earliest TNM stage, IA1 (small tumor, no spread), have a two-year survival of 97% and five-year survival of 92%.[57] Those diagnosed at the most-advanced stage, IVB, have a two-year survival of 10% and a five-year survival of 0%.[57] Five-year survival is higher in women (22%) than men (16%).[4] Women tend to be diagnosed with less-advanced disease, and have better outcomes than men diagnosed at the same stage.[58] Average five-year survival also varies across the world, with particularly high five-year survival in Japan (33%), and five-year survival above 20% in 12 other countries: Mauritius, Canada, the US, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel, Latvia, Iceland, Sweden, Austria, and Switzerland.[59]\n\n\nSCLC is particularly aggressive. 10–15% of people survive five years after a SCLC diagnosis.[38] As with other types of lung cancer, the extent of disease at diagnosis also influences prognosis. The average person diagnosed with limited-stage SCLC survives 12–20 months from diagnosis; with extensive-stage SCLC around 12 months.[38] While SCLC often responds initially to treatment, most people eventually relapse with chemotherapy-resistant cancer, surviving an average 3–4 months from the time of relapse.[38] Those with limited stage SCLC that go into complete remission after chemotherapy and radiotherapy have a 50% chance of brain metastases developing within the next two years – a chance reduced by prophylactic cranial irradiation.[39]\n\n\nSeveral other personal and disease factors are associated with improved outcomes. Those diagnosed at a younger age tend to have better outcomes. Those who smoke or experience weight loss as a symptom tend to have worse outcomes. Tumor mutations in KRAS are associated with reduced survival.[58]\n\n\n\n### Experience[edit]\n\n\nThe uncertainty of lung cancer prognosis often causes stress, and makes future planning difficult, for those with lung cancer and their families.[60] Those whose cancer goes into remission often experience fear of their cancer returning or progressing, associated with poor quality of life, negative mood, and functional impairment. This fear is exacerbated by frequent or prolonged surveillance imaging, and other reminders of cancer risks.[60]\n\n\n\n## Causes[edit]\n\n\nLung cancer is caused by genetic damage to the DNA of lung cells. These changes are sometimes random, but are typically induced by breathing in toxic substances such as cigarette smoke.[61][62] Cancer-causing genetic changes affect the cell's normal functions, including cell proliferation, programmed cell death (apoptosis), and DNA repair.[63] Eventually, cells gain enough genetic changes to grow uncontrollably, forming a tumor, and eventually spreading within and then beyond the lung. Rampant tumor growth and spread causes the symptoms of lung cancer. If unstopped, the spreading tumor will eventually cause the death of affected individuals.\n\n\n\n### Smoking[edit]\n\n\n![Graph showing that lung cancer rates rise and fall with cigarette consumption.](image)Relationship between cigarette consumption per person (blue) and male lung cancer rates (dark yellow) in the US\nTobacco smoking is by far the major contributor to lung cancer, causing 80% to 90% of cases.[64] Lung cancer risk increases with quantity of cigarettes consumed.[65] Tobacco smoking's carcinogenic effect is due to various chemicals in tobacco smoke that cause DNA mutations, increasing the chance of cells becoming cancerous.[66] The International Agency for Research on Cancer identifies at least 50 chemicals in tobacco smoke as carcinogenic, and the most potent is tobacco-specific nitrosamines.[65] Exposure to these chemicals causes several kinds of DNA damage: DNA adducts, oxidative stress, and breaks in the DNA strands.[67] Being around tobacco smoke – called passive smoking – can also cause lung cancer. Living with a tobacco smoker increases one's risk of developing lung cancer by 24%. An estimated 17% of lung cancer cases in those who do not smoke are caused by high levels of environmental tobacco smoke.[68]\n\n\nVaping may be a risk factor for lung cancer, but less than that of cigarettes, and further research as of 2021 is necessary due to the length of time it can take for lung cancer to develop following an exposure to carcinogens.[69]\n\n\nThe smoking of non-tobacco products is not known to be associated with lung cancer development. Marijuana smoking does not seem to independently cause lung cancer – despite the relatively high levels of tar and known carcinogens in marijuana smoke. The relationship between smoking cocaine and developing lung cancer has not been studied as of 2020.[70]\n\n\n\n### Environmental exposures[edit]\n\n\n![A sign reads \"Danger, asbestos, cancer and lung diseaes hazard, authorized personnel only\"](image)Sign warning of potential for asbestos exposure, typically used during demolition/renovation of asbestos-containing buildings\nExposure to a variety of other toxic chemicals – typically encountered in certain occupations – is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.[71] Occupational exposures to carcinogens cause 9–15% of lung cancer.[71] A prominent example is asbestos, which causes lung cancer either directly or indirectly by inflaming the lung.[71] Exposure to all commercially available forms of asbestos increases cancer risk, and cancer risk increases with time of exposure.[71] Asbestos and cigarette smoking increase risk synergistically – that is, the risk of someone who smokes and has asbestos exposure dying from lung cancer is much higher than would be expected from adding the two risks together.[71] Similarly, exposure to radon, a naturally occurring breakdown product of the Earth's radioactive elements, is associated with increased lung cancer risk. Radon levels vary with geography.[72] Underground miners have the greatest exposure; however even the lower levels of radon that seep into residential spaces can increase occupants' risk of lung cancer. Like asbestos, cigarette smoking and radon exposure increase risk synergistically.[71] Radon exposure is responsible for between 3% and 14% of lung cancer cases.[72]\n\n\nSeveral other chemicals encountered in various occupations are also associated with increased lung cancer risk including arsenic used in wood preservation, pesticide application, and some ore smelting; ionizing radiation encountered during uranium mining; vinyl chloride in papermaking; beryllium in jewelers, ceramics workers, missile technicians, and nuclear reactor workers; chromium in stainless steel production, welding, and hide tanning; nickel in electroplaters, glass workers, metal workers, welders, and those who make batteries, ceramics, and jewelry; and diesel exhaust encountered by miners.[71]\n\n\nExposure to air pollution, especially particulate matter released by motor vehicle exhaust and fossil fuel-burning power plants, increases the risk of lung cancer.[73][74] Indoor air pollution from burning wood, charcoal, or crop residue for cooking and heating has also been linked to an increased risk of developing lung cancer.[75] The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified emission from household burning of coal and biomass as \"carcinogenic\" and \"probably carcinogenic\" respectively.[75]\n\n\n\n### Other diseases[edit]\n\n\nSeveral other diseases that cause inflammation of the lung increase one's risk of lung cancer. This association is strongest for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder – the risk is highest in those with the most inflammation, and reduced in those whose inflammation is treated with inhaled corticosteroids.[76] Other inflammatory lung and immune system diseases such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, interstitial fibrosis, scleroderma, *Chlamydia pneumoniae* infection, tuberculosis, and HIV infection are associated with increased risk of developing lung cancer.[76] Epstein–Barr virus is associated with the development of the rare lung cancer lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma in people from Asia, but not in people from Western nations.[77] A role for several other infectious agents – namely human papillomaviruses, BK virus, JC virus, human cytomegalovirus, SV40, measles virus, and Torque teno virus – in lung cancer development has been studied but remains inconclusive as of 2020.[77]\n\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nParticular gene combinations may make some people more susceptible to lung cancer. Close family members of those with lung cancer have around twice the risk of developing lung cancer as an average person, even after controlling for occupational exposure and smoking habits.[78] Genome-wide association studies have identified many gene variants associated with lung cancer risk, each of which contributes a small risk increase.[79] Many of these genes participate in pathways known to be involved in carcinogenesis, namely DNA repair, inflammation, the cell division cycle, cellular stress responses, and chromatin remodeling.[79] Some rare genetic disorders that increase the risk of various cancers also increase the risk of lung cancer, namely retinoblastoma and Li–Fraumeni syndrome.[80]\n\n\n\n## Pathogenesis[edit]\n\n\nAs with all cancers, lung cancer is triggered by mutations that allow tumor cells to endlessly multiply, stimulate blood vessel growth, avoid apoptosis (programmed cell death), generate pro-growth signalling molecules, ignore anti-growth signalling molecules, and eventually spread into surrounding tissue or metastasize throughout the body.[81] Different tumors can acquire these abilities through different mutations, though generally cancer-contributing mutations activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor suppressors.[81] Some mutations – called \"driver mutations\" – are particularly common in adenocarcinomas, and contribute disproportionately to tumor development. These typically occur in the receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR, BRAF, MET, KRAS, and PIK3CA.[81] Similarly, some adenocarcinomas are driven by chromosomal rearrangements that result in overexpression of tyrosine kinases ALK, ROS1, NTRK, and RET. A given tumor will typically have just one driver mutation.[81] In contrast, SCLCs rarely have these driver mutations, and instead often have mutations that have inactivated the tumor suppressors p53 and RB.[82] A cluster of tumor suppressor genes on the short arm of chromosome 3 are often lost early in the development of all lung cancers.[81]\n\n\n\n## Prevention[edit]\n\n\n### Smoking cessation[edit]\n\n\nThose who smoke can reduce their lung cancer risk by quitting smoking – the risk reduction is greater the longer a person goes without smoking.[83] Self-help programs tend to have little influence on success of smoking cessation, whereas combined counseling and pharmacotherapy improve cessation rates.[83] The US FDA has approved antidepressant therapies and the nicotine replacement varenicline as first-line therapies to aid in smoking cessation. Clonidine and nortriptyline are recommended second-line therapies.[83] The majority of those diagnosed with lung cancer attempt to quit smoking; around half succeed.[84] Even after lung cancer diagnosis, smoking cessation improves treatment outcomes, reducing cancer treatment toxicity and failure rates, and lengthening survival time.[85]\n\n\n\n![A sign reads \"No smoking on platform\"](image)\nNo smoking sign at a train station in Colorado\n![A cigarette package features warning text and a large photograph of a person with a large side wound.](image)\nGraphic cigarette packaging in Belgium labelled \"open wound following lung surgery\"\n\nAt a societal level, smoking cessation can be promoted by tobacco control policies that make tobacco products more difficult to obtain or use. Many such policies are mandated or recommended by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, ratified by 182 countries, representing over 90% of the world's population.[86] The WHO groups these policies into six intervention categories, each of which has been shown to be effective in reducing the cost of tobacco-induced disease burden on a population: \n\n\n\n1. increasing the price of tobacco by raising taxes;\n2. banning tobacco use in public places to reduce exposure;\n3. banning tobacco advertisements;\n4. publicizing the dangers of tobacco products;\n5. instituting help programs for those attempting to quit smoking; and\n6. monitoring population-level tobacco use and the effectiveness of tobacco control policies.[87]\n\n\nPolicies implementing each intervention are associated with decreases in tobacco smoking prevalence. The more policies implemented, the greater the reduction.[88] Reducing access to tobacco for adolescents is particularly effective at decreasing uptake of habitual smoking, and adolescent demand for tobacco products is particularly sensitive to increases in cost.[89]\n\n\n\n### Diet and lifestyle[edit]\n\n\nSeveral foods and dietary supplements have been associated with lung cancer risk. High consumption of some animal products – red meat (but not other meats or fish), saturated fats, as well as nitrosamines and nitrites (found in salted and smoked meats) – is associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer.[90] In contrast, high consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer, particularly consumption of cruciferous vegetables and raw fruits and vegetables.[90] Based on the beneficial effects of fruits and vegetables, supplementation of several individual vitamins have been studied. Supplementation with vitamin A or beta-carotene had no effect on lung cancer, and instead slightly increased mortality.[90] Dietary supplementation with vitamin E or retinoids similarly had no effect.[91] Consumption of polyunsaturated fats, tea, alcoholic beverages, and coffee are all associated with reduced risk of developing lung cancer.[90]\n\n\nAlong with diet, body weight and exercise habits are also associated with lung cancer risk. Being overweight is associated with a lower risk of developing lung cancer, possibly due to the tendency of those who smoke cigarettes to have a lower body weight.[92] However, being underweight is also associated with a reduced lung cancer risk.[92] Some studies have shown those who exercise regularly or have better cardiovascular fitness to have a lower risk of developing lung cancer.[92]\n\n\n\n## Epidemiology[edit]\n\n\n![World map with countries in one of five colors](image)Age-standardized lung cancer incidence in 2020 per 100,000 people:[93] >40\n30–40\n20–30\n10–20\n<10\n\nWorldwide, lung cancer is the most diagnosed type of cancer, and the leading cause of cancer death.[94][95] In 2020, 2.2 million new cases were diagnosed, and 1.8 million people died from lung cancer, representing 18% of all cancer deaths.[3] Lung cancer deaths are expected to rise globally to nearly 3 million annual deaths by 2035, due to high rates of tobacco use and aging populations.[95] Lung cancer is rare in those younger than 40; after that, cancer rates increase with age, stabilizing around age 80.[1] The median age of a person diagnosed with lung cancer is 70; the median age of death is 72.[2]\n\n\nLung cancer incidence varies by geography and sex, with the highest rates in Micronesia, Polynesia, Europe, Asia, and North America; and lowest rates in Africa and Central America.[96] Globally, around 8% of men and 6% of women develop lung cancer in their lifetimes.[1] The ratio of lung cancer cases in men to women varies considerably by geography, from as high as nearly 12:1 in Belarus, to 1:1 in Brazil, likely due to differences in smoking patterns.[97]\n\n\nLung cancer risk is influenced by environmental exposure, namely cigarette smoking, as well as occupational risks in mining, shipbuilding, petroleum refining, and occupations that involve asbestos exposure.[97] People who have smoked cigarettes account for 85–90% of lung cancer cases, and 15% of smokers develop lung cancer.[97] Non-smokers' risk of developing lung cancer is also influenced by tobacco smoking; secondhand smoke (that is, being around tobacco smoke) increases risk of developing lung cancer around 30%, with risk correlated to duration of exposure.[97]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nLung cancer was uncommon before the advent of cigarette smoking. Surgeon Alton Ochsner recalled that as a Washington University medical student in 1919, his entire medical school class was summoned to witness an autopsy of a man who had died from lung cancer, and told they may never see such a case again.[98][99] In Isaac Adler's 1912 *Primary Malignant Growths of the Lungs and Bronchi*, he called lung cancer \"among the rarest forms of disease\";[100] Adler tabulated the 374 cases of lung cancer that had been published to that time, concluding the disease was increasing in incidence.[101] By the 1920s, several theories had been put forward linking the increase in lung cancer to various chemical exposures that had increased including tobacco smoke, asphalt dust, industrial air pollution, and poisonous gasses from World War I.[101]\n\n\nOver the following decades, growing scientific evidence linked lung cancer to cigarette consumption. Through the 1940s and early 1950s, several case-control studies showed that those with lung cancer were more likely to have smoked cigarettes compared to those without lung cancer.[102] These were followed by several prospective cohort studies in the 1950s – including the first report of the British Doctors Study in 1954 – all of which showed that those who smoked tobacco were at dramatically increased risk of developing lung cancer.[102]\n\n\n\n![Full page text advertisement](image)\"A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers\", an advertisement run in newspapers nationwide in January 1954 as part of Hill & Knowlton's campaign to cast doubt on the link between cigarettes and cancer\nA 1953 study showing that tar from cigarette smoke could cause tumors in mice attracted attention in the popular press, with features in *Life* and *Time* magazines. Facing public concern and falling stock prices, the CEOs of six of the largest American tobacco companies gathered in December 1953.[103] They enlisted the help of public relations firm Hill & Knowlton to craft a multi-pronged strategy aiming to distract from accumulating evidence by funding tobacco-friendly research, declaring the link to lung cancer \"controversial\", and demanding ever-more research to settle this purported controversy.[103][104] At the same time, internal research at the major tobacco companies supported the link between tobacco and lung cancer; though these results were kept secret from the public.[105]\n\n\nAs evidence linking tobacco use with lung cancer mounted, various health bodies announced official positions linking the two. In 1962, the United Kingdom's Royal College of Physicians officially concluded that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, prompting the United States Surgeon General to empanel an advisory committee, which deliberated in secret over nine sessions between November 1962 and December 1963.[106] The committee's report, published in January 1964, firmly concluded that cigarette smoking \"far outweighs all other factors\" in causing lung cancer.[107] The report received substantial coverage in the popular press, and is widely seen as a turning point for public recognition that tobacco smoking causes lung cancer.[106][108]\n\n\nThe connection with radon gas was first recognized among miners in Germany's Ore Mountains. As early as 1500, miners were noted to develop a deadly disease called \"mountain sickness\" (\"Bergkrankheit\"), identified as lung cancer by the late 19th century.[109][110] By 1938, up to 80% of miners in affected regions died from the disease.[109] In the 1950s radon and its breakdown products became established as causes of lung cancer in miners. Based largely on studies of miners, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified radon as \"carcinogenic to humans\" in 1988.[110] In 1956, a study revealed radon in Swedish residences. Over the following decades, high radon concentrations were found in residences across the world; by the 1980s many countries had established national radon programs to catalog and mitigate residential radon.[111]\n\n\nThe first successful pneumonectomy for lung cancer was performed in 1933 by Evarts Graham at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri.[112] Over the following decades, surgical development focused on sparing as much healthy lung tissue as possible, with the lobectomy surpassing the pneumectomy in frequency by the 1960s, and the wedge resection appearing in the early 1970s.[113][114] This trend continud with the development of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in the 1980s, now widely performed for many lung cancer surgeries.[115]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nWhile lung cancer is the deadliest type of cancer, it receives the third-most funding from the US National Cancer Institute (NCI, the world's largest cancer research funder) behind brain cancers and breast cancer.[116] Despite high levels of gross research funding, lung cancer funding per death lags behind many other cancers, with around $3,200 spent on lung cancer research in 2022 per US death, considerably lower than that for brain cancer ($22,000 per death), breast cancer ($14,000 per death), and cancer as a whole ($11,000 per death).[117] A similar trend holds for private nonprofit organizations. Annual revenues of lung cancer-focused nonprofits rank fifth among cancer types, but lung cancer nonprofits have lower revenue than would be expected for the number of lung cancer cases, deaths, and potential years of life lost.[118]\n\n\nDespite this, many investigational lung cancer treatments are undergoing clinical trials – with nearly 2,250 active clinical trials registered as of 2021.[119] Of these, a large plurality are testing radiotherapy regimens (26% of trials) and surgical techniques (22%). Many others are testing targeted anticancer drugs, with targets including EGFR (17% of trials), microtubules (12%), VEGF (12%), immune pathways (10%), mTOR (1%), and histone deacetylases (<1%).[120]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Horn & Iams 2022, \"Epidemiology\".\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Bade & Dela Cruz 2020, \"Age\".\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Sung et al. 2021, \"Lung cancer\".\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Rivera, Mody & Weiner 2022, \"Introduction\".\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** Pastis, Gonzalez & Silvestri 2022, \"Presentation/Initial Evaluation\".\n6. **^** Nasim, Sabath & Eapen 2019, \"Clinical Manifestations\".\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** Horn & Iams 2022, \"Clinical Manifestations\".\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Diagnosis – Lung Cancer\".

Lung cancer is caused by genetic damage to the DNA of cells in the airways, often caused by cigarette smoking or inhaling damaging chemicals. Damaged airway cells gain the ability to multiply unchecked, causing the growth of a tumor. Without treatment, tumors spread throughout the lung, damaging lung function. Eventually lung tumors metastasize, spreading to other parts of the body. \n\n\nEarly lung cancer often has no symptoms and can only be detected by medical imaging. As the cancer progresses, most people experience nonspecific respiratory problems: coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Other symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor. Those suspected of having lung cancer typically undergo a series of imaging tests to determine the location and extent of any tumors. Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires a biopsy of the suspected tumor be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. In addition to recognizing cancerous cells, a pathologist can classify the tumor according to the type of cells it originates from. Around 15% of cases are small-cell lung cancer, and the remaining 85% (the non-small-cell lung cancers) are adenocarcinomas, squamous-cell carcinomas, and large-cell carcinomas. After diagnosis, further imaging and biopsies are done to determine the cancer's stage based on how far it has spread.\n\n\nTreatment for early stage lung cancer includes surgery to remove the tumor, sometimes followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells. Later stage cancer is treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy alongside drug treatments that target specific cancer subtypes. Even with treatment, only around 20% of people survive five years on from their diagnosis.[4] Survival rates are higher in those diagnosed at an earlier stage, diagnosed at a younger age, and in women compared to men.\n\n\nMost lung cancer cases are caused by tobacco smoking. The remainder are caused by exposure to hazardous substances like asbestos and radon gas, or by genetic mutations that arise by chance. Consequently, lung cancer prevention efforts encourage people to avoid hazardous chemicals and quit smoking. Quitting smoking both reduces one's chance of developing lung cancer and improves treatment outcomes in those already diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\n\nLung cancer is the most diagnosed and deadliest cancer worldwide, with 2.2 million cases in 2020 resulting in 1.8 million deaths.[3] Lung cancer is rare in those younger than 40; the average age at diagnosis is 70 years, and the average age at death 72.[2] Incidence and outcomes vary widely across the world, depending on patterns of tobacco use. Prior to the advent of cigarette smoking in the 20th century, lung cancer was a rare disease. In the 1950s and 1960s, increasing evidence linked lung cancer and tobacco use, culminating in declarations by most large national health bodies discouraging tobacco use.\n\n\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms[edit]\n\n\nEarly lung cancer often has no symptoms. When symptoms do arise they are often nonspecific respiratory problems – coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain – that can differ from person to person.[5] Those who experience coughing tend to report either a new cough, or an increase in the frequency or strength of a pre-existing cough.[5] Around one in four cough up blood, ranging from small streaks in the sputum to large amounts.[6][5] Around half of those diagnosed with lung cancer experience shortness of breath, while 25–50% experience a dull, persistent chest pain that remains in the same location over time.[5] In addition to respiratory symptoms, some experience systemic symptoms including loss of appetite, weight loss, general weakness, fever, and night sweats.[5][7]\n\n\nSome less common symptoms suggest tumors in particular locations. Tumors in the thorax can cause breathing problems by obstructing the trachea or disrupting the nerve to the diaphragm; difficulty swallowing by compressing the esophagus; hoarseness by disrupting the nerves of the larynx; and Horner's syndrome by disrupting the sympathetic nervous system.[5][7] Horner's syndrome is also common in tumors at the top of the lung, known as Pancoast tumors, which also cause shoulder pain that radiates down the little-finger side of the arm as well as destruction of the topmost ribs.[7] Swollen lymph nodes above the collarbone can indicate a tumor that has spread within the chest.[5] Tumors obstructing bloodflow to the heart can cause superior vena cava syndrome (swelling of the upper body and shortness of breath), while tumors infiltrating the area around the heart can cause fluid buildup around the heart, arrythmia (irregular heartbeat), and heart failure.[7]\n\n\nAbout one in three people diagnosed with lung cancer have symptoms caused by metastases in sites other than the lungs.[7] Lung cancer can metastasize anywhere in the body, with different symptoms depending on the location. Brain metastases can cause headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and neurological deficits. Bone metastases can cause pain, bone fractures, and compression of the spinal cord. Metastasis into the bone marrow can deplete blood cells and cause leukoerythroblastosis (immature cells in the blood).[7] Liver metastases can cause liver enlargement, pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, fever, and weight loss.[7]\n\n\nLung tumors often cause the release of body-altering hormones, which cause unusual symptoms, called paraneoplastic syndromes.[7] Inappropriate hormone release can cause dramatic shifts in concentrations of blood minerals. Most common is hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) caused by over-production of parathyroid hormone-related protein or parathyroid hormone. Hypercalcemia can manifest as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, increased thirst, frequent urination, and altered mental status.[7] Those with lung cancer also commonly experience hypokalemia (low potassium) due to inappropriate secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone, as well as hyponatremia (low sodium) due to overproduction of antidiuretic hormone or atrial natriuretic peptide.[7] About one of three people with lung cancer develop nail clubbing, while up to one in ten experience hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (nail clubbing, joint soreness, and skin thickening). A variety of autoimmune disorders can arise as paraneoplastic syndromes in those with lung cancer, including Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (which causes muscle weakness), sensory neuropathies, muscle inflammation, brain swelling, and autoimmune deterioration of cerebellum, limbic system, or brainstem.[7] Up to one in twelve people with lung cancer have paraneoplastic blood clotting, including migratory venous thrombophlebitis, clots in the heart, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (clots throughout the body).[7] Paraneoplastic syndromes involving the skin and kidneys are rare, each occurring in up to 1% of those with lung cancer.[7]\n\n\n\n## Diagnosis[edit]\n\n\n![CT scan of lung, with tumor appearing as a sharp white shape](image)CT scan showing a cancerous tumor in the left lung\nA person suspected of having lung cancer will have imaging tests done to evaluate the presence, extent, and location of tumors. First, many primary care providers perform a chest X-ray to look for a mass inside the lung.[8] The X-ray may reveal an obvious mass, the widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (lung collapse), consolidation (pneumonia), or pleural effusion;[9] however, some lung tumors are not visible by X-ray.[5] Next, many undergo computed tomography (CT) scanning, which can reveal the sizes and locations of tumors.[8][10]\n\n\nA definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires a biopsy of the suspected tissue be histologically examined for cancer cells.[11] Given the location of lung cancer tumors, biopsies can often be obtained by minimally invasive techniques: a fiberoptic bronchoscope that can retrieve tissue (sometimes guided by endobronchial ultrasound), fine needle aspiration, or other imaging-guided biopsy through the skin.[11] Those who cannot undergo a typical biopsy procedure may instead have a liquid biopsy taken (that is, a sample of some body fluid) which may contain circulating tumor DNA that can be detected.[12]\n\n\n\n![Diagram of a machine attached to a tube running down a person's mouth and into their trachea and bronchi](image)Diagram showing a bronchoscopy\nImaging is also used to assess the extent of cancer spread. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning or combined PET-CT scanning is often used to locate metastases in the body. Since PET scanning is less sensitive in the brain, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – or CT where MRI is unavailable – to scan the brain for metastases in those with NSCLC and large tumors, or tumors that have spread to the nearby lymph nodes.[13] When imaging suggests the tumor has spread, the suspected metastasis is often biopsied to confirm that it is cancerous.[11] Lung cancer most commonly metastasizes to the brain, bones, liver, and adrenal glands.[14]\n\n\nLung cancer can often appear as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan. In lung cancer screening studies as many as 30% of those screened have a lung nodule, the majority of which turn out to be benign.[15] Besides lung cancer many other diseases can also give this appearance, including hamartomas, and infectious granulomas caused by tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, or coccidioidomycosis.[16]\n\n\n\n### Classification[edit]\n\n\n![Microscope images of lung tissue. At top-left, healthy lung with clear air-filled alveoli. Others are full of tumor or material, per caption.](image)H&E stained samples from lung biopsies: (Top-left) Normal bronchiole surrounded by alveoli, (top-right) adenocarcinoma with papillary (finger-like) growth, (bottom-left) alveoli filled with mucin suggesting adenocarcinoma nearby, (bottom-right) squamous-cell carcinoma, with alveoli full of keratin.\nAt diagnosis, lung cancer is classified based on the type of cells the tumor is derived from; tumors derived from different cells progress and respond to treatment differently. There are two main types of lung cancer, categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a microscope: small cell lung cancer (SCLC; 15% of cases) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 85% of cases).[17] SCLC tumors are often found near the center of the lungs, in the major airways.[18] Their cells appear small with ill-defined boundaries, not much cytoplasm, many mitochondria, and have distinctive nuclei with granular-looking chromatin and no visible nucleoli.[19] NSCLCs comprise a group of three cancer types: adenocarcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma.[19] Nearly 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinomas.[20] Their cells grow in three-dimensional clumps, resemble glandular cells, and may produce mucin.[19] About 30% of lung cancers are squamous-cell carcinomas. They typically occur close to large airways.[20] The tumors consist of sheets of cells, with layers of keratin.[19] A hollow cavity and associated cell death are commonly found at the center of the tumor.[20] Less than 10% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinomas,[19] so named because the cells are large, with excess cytoplasm, large nuclei, and conspicuous nucleoli.[20] Around 10% of lung cancers are rarer types.[19] These include mixes of the above subtypes like adenosquamous carcinoma, and rare subtypes such as carcinoid tumors, and sarcomatoid carcinomas.[20]\n\n\nSeveral lung cancer types are subclassified based on the growth characteristics of the cancer cells. Adenocarcinomas are classified as lepidic (growing along the surface of intact alveolar walls),[21] acinar and papillary, or micropapillary and solid pattern. Lepidic adenocarcinomas tend to be least aggressive, while micropapillary and solid pattern adenocarcinomas are most aggressive.[22]\n\n\nIn addition to examining cell morphology, biopsies are often stained by immunohistochemistry to confirm lung cancer classification. SCLCs bear the markers of neuroendocrine cells, such as chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56.[23] Adenocarcinomas tend to express Napsin-A and TTF-1; squamous cell carcinomas lack Napsin-A and TTF-1, but express p63 and its cancer-specific isoform p40.[19] CK7 and CK20 are also commonly used to differentiate lung cancers. CK20 is found in several cancers, but typically absent from lung cancer. CK7 is present in many lung cancers, but absent from squamous cell carcinomas.[24]\n\n\n\n### Staging[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lung cancer staging\n\n\n\nStage group according to TNM classification in lung cancer[25]\n| TNM\n | Stage group\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| T1a N0 M0\n | IA1\n |\n| T1b N0 M0\n | IA2\n |\n| T1c N0 M0\n | IA3\n |\n| T2a N0 M0\n | IB\n |\n| T2b N0 M0\n | IIA\n |\n| T1–T2 N1 M0\n | IIB\n |\n| T3 N0 M0\n |\n| T1–T2 N2 M0\n | IIIA\n |\n| T3 N1 M0\n |\n| T4 N0–N1 M0\n |\n| T1–T2 N3 M0\n | IIIB\n |\n| T3–T4 N2 M0\n |\n| T3–T4 N3 M0\n | IIIC\n |\n| Any T, any N, M1a–M1b\n | IVA\n |\n| Any T, any N, M1c\n | IVB\n |\n\n\nLung cancer staging is an assessment of the degree of spread of the cancer from its original source. It is one of the factors affecting both the prognosis and the treatment of lung cancer.[26]\n\n\nSCLC is typically staged with a relatively simple system: limited stage or extensive stage. Around a third of people are diagnosed at the limited stage, meaning cancer is confined to one side of the chest, within the scope of a single radiotherapy field.[26] The other two thirds are diagnosed at the \"extensive stage\", with cancer spread to both sides of the chest, or to other parts of the body.[26]\n\n\nNSCLC – and sometimes SCLC – is typically staged with the American Joint Committee on Cancer's Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system.[27] The size and extent of the tumor (T), spread to regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M) are scored individually, and combined to form stage groups.[28]\n\n\nRelatively small tumors are designated T1, which are subdivided by size: tumors ≤ 1 centimeter (cm) across are T1a; 1–2 cm T1b; 2–3 cm T1c. Tumors up to 5 cm across, or those that have spread to the visceral pleura (tissue covering the lung) or main bronchi, are designated T2. T2a designates 3–4 cm tumors; T2b 4–5 cm tumors. T3 tumors are up to 7 cm across, have multiple nodules in the same lobe of the lung, or invade the chest wall, diaphragm (or the nerve that controls it), or area around the heart.[28][29] Tumors that are larger than 7 cm, have nodules spread in different lobes of a lung, or invade the mediastinum (center of the chest cavity), heart, largest blood vessels that supply the heart, trachea, esophagus, or spine are designated T4.[28][29] Lymph node staging depends on the extent of local spread: with the cancer metastasized to no lymph nodes (N0), pulmonary or hilar nodes (along the bronchi) on the same side as the tumor (N1), mediastinal or subcarinal lymph nodes (in the middle of the lungs, N2), or lymph nodes on the opposite side of the lung from the tumor (N3).[29] Metastases are staged as no metastases (M0), nearby metastases (M1a; the space around the lung or the heart, or the opposite lung), a single distant metastasis (M1b), or multiple metastases (M1c).[28]\n\n\nThese T, N, and M scores are combined to designate a stage grouping for the cancer. Cancer limited to smaller tumors is designated stage I. Disease with larger tumors or spread to the nearest lymph nodes is stage II. Cancer with the largest tumors or extensive lymph node spread is stage III. Cancer that has metastasized is stage IV. Each stage is further subdivided based on the combination of T, N, and M scores.[30]\n\n\n\n\n\nTNM classification in lung cancer[31]\n| \n\n| T: Primary tumor\n |\n| --- |\n| T0\n | No primary tumor\n |\n| Tis\n | Carcinoma in situ |\n| T1\n | Tumor ≤ 3 cm across, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura\n |\n|  | T1mi\n | Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma\n |\n| T1a\n | Tumor ≤ 1 cm across\n |\n| T1b\n | Tumor > 1 cm but ≤ 2 cm across\n |\n| T1c\n | Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 3 cm across\n |\n| T2\n | Any of:\n | Tumor size > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm across\n |\n| Involvement of the main bronchus but not the carina\n |\n| Invasion of visceral pleura\n |\n| Atelectasis/obstructive pneumonitis extending to the hilum |\n|  | T2a\n | Tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 4 cm across\n |\n| T2b\n | Tumor > 4 cm but ≤ 5 cm across\n |\n| T3\n | Any of:\n | Tumor size > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm across\n |\n| Invasion into the chest wall, phrenic nerve, or parietal pericardium |\n| Separate tumor nodule in the same lobe\n |\n| T4\n | Any of:\n | Tumor size > 7 cm\n |\n| Invasion of the diaphragm, mediastinum, heart, great vessels, trachea, carina, recurrent laryngeal nerve, esophagus, or vertebral body |\n| Separate tumor nodule in a different lobe of the same lung\n |\n\n | \n\n| N: Lymph nodes\n |\n| --- |\n| N0\n | No lymph node metastasis\n |\n| N1\n | Metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial or hilar lymph nodes\n |\n| N2\n | Metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal lymph nodes\n |\n| N3\n | Any of:\n | Metastasis to scalene or supraclavicular lymph nodes\n |\n| Metastasis to contralateral hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes\n |\n\n | \n\n| M: Metastasis\n |\n| --- |\n| M0\n | No distant metastasis\n |\n| M1a\n | Any of:\n | Separate tumor nodule in the other lung\n |\n| Tumor with pleural or pericardial nodules\n |\n| Malignant pleural or pericardial effusion |\n| M1b\n | A single metastasis outside the chest\n |\n| M1c\n | Two or more metastases outside the chest\n |\n\n |\n\n\n### Screening[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lung cancer screening\n\nSome countries recommend that people who are at a high risk of developing lung cancer be screened at different intervals using low-dose CT lung scans. Screening programs may result in early detection of lung tumors in people who are not yet experiencing symptoms of lung cancer, ideally, early enough that the tumors can be successfully treated and result in decreased mortality.[32] There is evidence that regular low-dose CT scans in people at high risk of developing lung cancer reduces total lung cancer deaths by as much as 20%.[15] Despite evidence of benefit in these populations, potential harms of screening include the potential for a person to have a 'false positive' screening result that may lead to unnecessary testing, invasive procedures, and distress.[33] Although rare, there is also a risk of radiation-induced cancer.[33] The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends yearly screening using low-dose CT in people between 55 and 80 who have a smoking history of at least 30 pack-years.[34] The European Commission recommends that cancer screening programs across the European Union be extended to include low-dose CT lung scans for current or previous smokers.[35] Similarly, The Canadian Task Force for Preventative Health recommends that people who are current or former smokers (smoking history of more than 30 pack years) and who are between the ages of 55–74 years be screened for lung cancer.[36]\n\n\n\n## Treatment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Treatment of lung cancer\n\nTreatment for lung cancer depends on the cancer's specific cell type, how far it has spread, and the person's health. Common treatments for early stage cancer includes surgical removal of the tumor, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. For later-stage cancer, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are combined with newer targeted molecular therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors.[4] All lung cancer treatment regimens are combined with lifestyle changes and palliative care to improve quality of life.[37]\n\n\n\n### Small-cell lung cancer[edit]\n\n\n![A person lays on a table under a large machine.](image)Setup for radiation therapy. The person lies flat while a radiation beam is focused on the tumor site\nLimited-stage SCLC is typically treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.[38] For chemotherapy, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend four to six cycles of a platinum-based chemotherapeutic – cisplatin or carboplatin – combined with either etoposide or irinotecan.[39] This is typically combined with thoracic radiation therapy – 45 Gray (Gy) twice-daily – alongside the first two chemotherapy cycles.[38] First-line therapy causes remission in up to 80% of those who receive it; however most people relapse with chemotherapy-resistant disease. Those who relapse are given second-line chemotherapies. Topotecan and lurbinectedin are approved by the US FDA for this purpose.[38] Irinotecan, paclitaxel, docetaxel, vinorelbine, etoposide, and gemcitabine are also sometimes used, and are similarly efficacious.[38] Prophylactic cranial irradiation can reduce the risk of brain metastases and improve survival in those with limited-stage disease.[40][38]\n\n\nExtensive-stage SCLC is treated first with etoposide along with either cisplatin or carboplatin. Radiotherapy is used only to shrink tumors that are causing particularly severe symptoms. Combining standard chemotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor can improve survival for a minority of those affected, extending the average person's lifespan by around 2 months.[41]\n\n\n\n### Non-small-cell lung cancer[edit]\n\n\n![A lung showing a small tumor. Increasingly large pieces are removed for wedge resection, segmentectomy, and lobectomy respectively](image)The extent of common surgeries to remove a lung tumor (shown in black). Areas that are surgically removed along with the tumor are shown in blue.\nFor stage I and stage II NSCLC the first line of treatment is often surgical removal of the affected lobe of the lung.[42] For those not well enough to tolerate full lobe removal, a smaller chunk of lung tissue can be removed by wedge resection or segmentectomy surgery.[42] Those with centrally located tumors and otherwise-healthy respiratory systems may have more extreme surgery to remove an entire lung (pneumonectomy).[42] Experienced thoracic surgeons, and a high-volume surgery clinic improve chances of survival.[42] Those who are unable or unwilling to undergo surgery can instead receive radiation therapy. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is best practice, typically administered several times over 1–2 weeks.[42] Chemotherapy has little effect in those with stage I NSCLC, and may worsen disease outcomes in those with the earliest disease. In those with stage II disease, chemotherapy is usually initiated six to twelve weeks after surgery, with up to four cycles of cisplatin – or carboplatin in those with kidney problems, neuropathy, or hearing impairment – combined with vinorelbine, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, or docetaxel.[42]\n\n\nTreatment for those with stage III NSCLC depends on the nature of their disease. Those with more limited spread may undergo surgery to have the tumor and affected lymph nodes removed, followed by chemotherapy and potentially radiotherapy. Those with particularly large tumors (T4) and those for whom surgery is impractical are treated with combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy along with the immunotherapy durvalumab.[43] Combined chemotherapy and radiation enhances survival compared to chemotherapy followed by radiation, though the combination therapy comes with harsher side effects.[43]\n\n\nThose with stage IV disease are treated with combinations of pain medication, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy.[44] Many cases of advanced disease can be treated with targeted therapies depending on the genetic makeup of the cancerous cells. Up to 30% of tumors have mutations in the *EGFR* gene that result in an overactive EGFR protein;[45] these can be treated with EGFR inhibitors osimertinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, or dacomitinib – with osimertinib known to be superior to erlotinib and gefitinib, and all superior to chemotherapy alone.[44] Up to 7% of those with NSCLC harbor mutations that result in hyperactive ALK protein, which can be treated with ALK inhibitors crizotinib, or its successors alectinib, brigatinib, and ceritinib.[44] Those treated with ALK inhibitors who relapse can then be treated with the third-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib.[44] Up to 5% with NSCLC have overactive MET, which can be inhibited with MET inhibitors capmatinib or tepotinib.[44] Targeted therapies are also available for some cancers with rare mutations. Cancers with hyperactive BRAF (around 2% of NSCLC) can be treated by dabrafenib combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib; those with activated ROS1 (around 1% of NSCLC) can be inhibited by crizotinib, lorlatinib, or entrectinib; overactive NTRK (<1% of NSCLC) by entrectinib or larotrectinib; active RET (around 1% of NSCLC) by selpercatinib.[44]\n\n\nPeople whose NSCLC is not targetable by current molecular therapies instead can be treated with combination chemotherapy plus immune checkpoint inhibitors, which prevent cancer cells from inactivating immune T cells. The chemotherapeutic agent of choice depends on the NSCLC subtype: cisplatin plus gemcitabine for squamous cell carcinoma, cisplatin plus pemetrexed for non-squamous cell carcinoma.[46] Immune checkpoint inhibitors are most effective against tumors that express the protein PD-L1, but are sometimes effective in those that do not.[47] Treatment with pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or combination nivolumab plus ipilimumab are all superior to chemotherapy alone against tumors expressing PD-L1.[47] Those who relapse on the above are treated with second-line chemotherapeutics docetaxel and ramucirumab.[48]\n\n\n\n### Palliative care[edit]\n\n\n![A machine attached to a tube that goes into a person's mouth and into a bronchus. At the end, an object emits radiation at a lung tumor.](image)Brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy) for lung cancer given via the airway\nIntegrating palliative care (medical care focused on improving symptoms and lessening discomfort) into lung cancer treatment from the time of diagnosis improves the survival time and quality of life of those with lung cancer.[49] Particularly common symptoms of lung cancer are shortness of breath and pain. Supplemental oxygen, improved airflow, re-orienting an affected person in bed, and low-dose morphine can all improve shortness of breath.[50] In around 20 to 30% of those with lung cancer – particularly those with late-stage disease – growth of the tumor can narrow or block the airway, causing coughing and difficulty breathing.[51] Obstructing tumors can be surgically removed where possible, though typically those with airway obstruction are not well enough for surgery. In such cases the American College of Chest Physicians recommends opening the airway by inserting a stent, attempting to shrink the tumor with localized radiation (brachytherapy), or physically removing the blocking tissue by bronchoscopy, sometimes aided by thermal or laser ablation.[52] Other causes of lung cancer-associated shortness of breath can be treated directly, such as antibiotics for a lung infection, diuretics for pulmonary edema, benzodiazepines for anxiety, and steroids for airway obstruction.[50]\n\n\nUp to 92% of those with lung cancer report pain, either from tissue damage at the tumor site(s) or nerve damage.[53] The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a three-tiered system for managing cancer pain. For those with mild pain (tier one), the WHO recommends acetominophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.[53] Around a third of people experience moderate (tier two) or severe (tier three) pain, for which the WHO recommends opioid painkillers.[53] Opioids are typically effective at easing nociceptive pain (pain caused by damage to various body tissues). Opioids are occasionally effective at easing neuropathic pain (pain cauesd by nerve damage). Neuropathic agents such as anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, are often used to ease neuropathic pain, either alone or in combination with opioids.[53] In many cases, targeted radiotherapy can be used to shrink tumors, reducing pain and other symptoms caused by tumor growth.[54]\n\n\nIndividuals who have advanced disease and are approaching end-of-life can benefit from dedicated end-of-life care to manage symptoms and ease suffering. As in earlier disease, pain and difficulty breathing are common, and can be managed with opioid pain medications, transitioning from oral medication to injected medication if the affected individual loses the ability to swallow.[55][56] Coughing is also common, and can be managed with opioids or cough suppressants. Some experience terminal delirium – confused behavior, unexplained movements, or a reversal of the sleep-wake cycle – which can be managed by antipsychotic drugs, low-dose sedatives, and investigating other causes of discomfort such as low blood sugar, constipation, and sepsis.[55] In the last few days of life, many develop terminal secretions – pooled fluid in the airways that can cause a rattling sound while breathing. This is thought not to cause respiratory problems, but can distress family members and caregivers. Terminal secretions can be reduced by anticholinergic medications.[55] Even those who are non-communicative or have reduced consciousness may be able to experience cancer-related pain, so pain medications are typically continued until the time of death.[55]\n\n\n\n## Prognosis[edit]\n\n\n![Graph showing five-year survival from lung cancer increasing from 1975 (11.7% of people) to 2015 (25.2%).](image)Percent of people who survive five years from a lung cancer diagnosis over time, according to the NIH SEER program\n\n\nFive-year survival in those diagnosed with lung cancer, by stage[57]\n| Clinical stage\n | Five-year survival (%)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| IA1\n | 92\n |\n| IA2\n | 83\n |\n| IA3\n | 77\n |\n| IB\n | 68\n |\n| IIA\n | 60\n |\n| IIB\n | 53\n |\n| IIIA\n | 36\n |\n| IIIB\n | 26\n |\n| IIIC\n | 13\n |\n| IVA\n | 10\n |\n| IVB\n | 0\n |\n\n\nAround 19% of people diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years from diagnosis, though prognosis varies based on the stage of the disease at diagnosis and the type of lung cancer.[4] Prognosis is better for people with lung cancer diagnosed at an earlier stage; those diagnosed at the earliest TNM stage, IA1 (small tumor, no spread), have a two-year survival of 97% and five-year survival of 92%.[57] Those diagnosed at the most-advanced stage, IVB, have a two-year survival of 10% and a five-year survival of 0%.[57] Five-year survival is higher in women (22%) than men (16%).[4] Women tend to be diagnosed with less-advanced disease, and have better outcomes than men diagnosed at the same stage.[58] Average five-year survival also varies across the world, with particularly high five-year survival in Japan (33%), and five-year survival above 20% in 12 other countries: Mauritius, Canada, the US, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel, Latvia, Iceland, Sweden, Austria, and Switzerland.[59]\n\n\nSCLC is particularly aggressive. 10–15% of people survive five years after a SCLC diagnosis.[38] As with other types of lung cancer, the extent of disease at diagnosis also influences prognosis. The average person diagnosed with limited-stage SCLC survives 12–20 months from diagnosis; with extensive-stage SCLC around 12 months.[38] While SCLC often responds initially to treatment, most people eventually relapse with chemotherapy-resistant cancer, surviving an average 3–4 months from the time of relapse.[38] Those with limited stage SCLC that go into complete remission after chemotherapy and radiotherapy have a 50% chance of brain metastases developing within the next two years – a chance reduced by prophylactic cranial irradiation.[39]\n\n\nSeveral other personal and disease factors are associated with improved outcomes. Those diagnosed at a younger age tend to have better outcomes. Those who smoke or experience weight loss as a symptom tend to have worse outcomes. Tumor mutations in KRAS are associated with reduced survival.[58]\n\n\n\n### Experience[edit]\n\n\nThe uncertainty of lung cancer prognosis often causes stress, and makes future planning difficult, for those with lung cancer and their families.[60] Those whose cancer goes into remission often experience fear of their cancer returning or progressing, associated with poor quality of life, negative mood, and functional impairment. This fear is exacerbated by frequent or prolonged surveillance imaging, and other reminders of cancer risks.[60]\n\n\n\n## Causes[edit]\n\n\nLung cancer is caused by genetic damage to the DNA of lung cells. These changes are sometimes random, but are typically induced by breathing in toxic substances such as cigarette smoke.[61][62] Cancer-causing genetic changes affect the cell's normal functions, including cell proliferation, programmed cell death (apoptosis), and DNA repair.[63] Eventually, cells gain enough genetic changes to grow uncontrollably, forming a tumor, and eventually spreading within and then beyond the lung. Rampant tumor growth and spread causes the symptoms of lung cancer. If unstopped, the spreading tumor will eventually cause the death of affected individuals.\n\n\n\n### Smoking[edit]\n\n\n![Graph showing that lung cancer rates rise and fall with cigarette consumption.](image)Relationship between cigarette consumption per person (blue) and male lung cancer rates (dark yellow) in the US\nTobacco smoking is by far the major contributor to lung cancer, causing 80% to 90% of cases.[64] Lung cancer risk increases with quantity of cigarettes consumed.[65] Tobacco smoking's carcinogenic effect is due to various chemicals in tobacco smoke that cause DNA mutations, increasing the chance of cells becoming cancerous.[66] The International Agency for Research on Cancer identifies at least 50 chemicals in tobacco smoke as carcinogenic, and the most potent is tobacco-specific nitrosamines.[65] Exposure to these chemicals causes several kinds of DNA damage: DNA adducts, oxidative stress, and breaks in the DNA strands.[67] Being around tobacco smoke – called passive smoking – can also cause lung cancer. Living with a tobacco smoker increases one's risk of developing lung cancer by 24%. An estimated 17% of lung cancer cases in those who do not smoke are caused by high levels of environmental tobacco smoke.[68]\n\n\nVaping may be a risk factor for lung cancer, but less than that of cigarettes, and further research as of 2021 is necessary due to the length of time it can take for lung cancer to develop following an exposure to carcinogens.[69]\n\n\nThe smoking of non-tobacco products is not known to be associated with lung cancer development. Marijuana smoking does not seem to independently cause lung cancer – despite the relatively high levels of tar and known carcinogens in marijuana smoke. The relationship between smoking cocaine and developing lung cancer has not been studied as of 2020.[70]\n\n\n\n### Environmental exposures[edit]\n\n\n![A sign reads \"Danger, asbestos, cancer and lung diseaes hazard, authorized personnel only\"](image)Sign warning of potential for asbestos exposure, typically used during demolition/renovation of asbestos-containing buildings\nExposure to a variety of other toxic chemicals – typically encountered in certain occupations – is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.[71] Occupational exposures to carcinogens cause 9–15% of lung cancer.[71] A prominent example is asbestos, which causes lung cancer either directly or indirectly by inflaming the lung.[71] Exposure to all commercially available forms of asbestos increases cancer risk, and cancer risk increases with time of exposure.[71] Asbestos and cigarette smoking increase risk synergistically – that is, the risk of someone who smokes and has asbestos exposure dying from lung cancer is much higher than would be expected from adding the two risks together.[71] Similarly, exposure to radon, a naturally occurring breakdown product of the Earth's radioactive elements, is associated with increased lung cancer risk. Radon levels vary with geography.[72] Underground miners have the greatest exposure; however even the lower levels of radon that seep into residential spaces can increase occupants' risk of lung cancer. Like asbestos, cigarette smoking and radon exposure increase risk synergistically.[71] Radon exposure is responsible for between 3% and 14% of lung cancer cases.[72]\n\n\nSeveral other chemicals encountered in various occupations are also associated with increased lung cancer risk including arsenic used in wood preservation, pesticide application, and some ore smelting; ionizing radiation encountered during uranium mining; vinyl chloride in papermaking; beryllium in jewelers, ceramics workers, missile technicians, and nuclear reactor workers; chromium in stainless steel production, welding, and hide tanning; nickel in electroplaters, glass workers, metal workers, welders, and those who make batteries, ceramics, and jewelry; and diesel exhaust encountered by miners.[71]\n\n\nExposure to air pollution, especially particulate matter released by motor vehicle exhaust and fossil fuel-burning power plants, increases the risk of lung cancer.[73][74] Indoor air pollution from burning wood, charcoal, or crop residue for cooking and heating has also been linked to an increased risk of developing lung cancer.[75] The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified emission from household burning of coal and biomass as \"carcinogenic\" and \"probably carcinogenic\" respectively.[75]\n\n\n\n### Other diseases[edit]\n\n\nSeveral other diseases that cause inflammation of the lung increase one's risk of lung cancer. This association is strongest for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder – the risk is highest in those with the most inflammation, and reduced in those whose inflammation is treated with inhaled corticosteroids.[76] Other inflammatory lung and immune system diseases such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, interstitial fibrosis, scleroderma, *Chlamydia pneumoniae* infection, tuberculosis, and HIV infection are associated with increased risk of developing lung cancer.[76] Epstein–Barr virus is associated with the development of the rare lung cancer lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma in people from Asia, but not in people from Western nations.[77] A role for several other infectious agents – namely human papillomaviruses, BK virus, JC virus, human cytomegalovirus, SV40, measles virus, and Torque teno virus – in lung cancer development has been studied but remains inconclusive as of 2020.[77]\n\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nParticular gene combinations may make some people more susceptible to lung cancer. Close family members of those with lung cancer have around twice the risk of developing lung cancer as an average person, even after controlling for occupational exposure and smoking habits.[78] Genome-wide association studies have identified many gene variants associated with lung cancer risk, each of which contributes a small risk increase.[79] Many of these genes participate in pathways known to be involved in carcinogenesis, namely DNA repair, inflammation, the cell division cycle, cellular stress responses, and chromatin remodeling.[79] Some rare genetic disorders that increase the risk of various cancers also increase the risk of lung cancer, namely retinoblastoma and Li–Fraumeni syndrome.[80]\n\n\n\n## Pathogenesis[edit]\n\n\nAs with all cancers, lung cancer is triggered by mutations that allow tumor cells to endlessly multiply, stimulate blood vessel growth, avoid apoptosis (programmed cell death), generate pro-growth signalling molecules, ignore anti-growth signalling molecules, and eventually spread into surrounding tissue or metastasize throughout the body.[81] Different tumors can acquire these abilities through different mutations, though generally cancer-contributing mutations activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor suppressors.[81] Some mutations – called \"driver mutations\" – are particularly common in adenocarcinomas, and contribute disproportionately to tumor development. These typically occur in the receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR, BRAF, MET, KRAS, and PIK3CA.[81] Similarly, some adenocarcinomas are driven by chromosomal rearrangements that result in overexpression of tyrosine kinases ALK, ROS1, NTRK, and RET. A given tumor will typically have just one driver mutation.[81] In contrast, SCLCs rarely have these driver mutations, and instead often have mutations that have inactivated the tumor suppressors p53 and RB.[82] A cluster of tumor suppressor genes on the short arm of chromosome 3 are often lost early in the development of all lung cancers.[81]\n\n\n\n## Prevention[edit]\n\n\n### Smoking cessation[edit]\n\n\nThose who smoke can reduce their lung cancer risk by quitting smoking – the risk reduction is greater the longer a person goes without smoking.[83] Self-help programs tend to have little influence on success of smoking cessation, whereas combined counseling and pharmacotherapy improve cessation rates.[83] The US FDA has approved antidepressant therapies and the nicotine replacement varenicline as first-line therapies to aid in smoking cessation. Clonidine and nortriptyline are recommended second-line therapies.[83] The majority of those diagnosed with lung cancer attempt to quit smoking; around half succeed.[84] Even after lung cancer diagnosis, smoking cessation improves treatment outcomes, reducing cancer treatment toxicity and failure rates, and lengthening survival time.[85]\n\n\n\n![A sign reads \"No smoking on platform\"](image)\nNo smoking sign at a train station in Colorado\n![A cigarette package features warning text and a large photograph of a person with a large side wound.](image)\nGraphic cigarette packaging in Belgium labelled \"open wound following lung surgery\"\n\nAt a societal level, smoking cessation can be promoted by tobacco control policies that make tobacco products more difficult to obtain or use. Many such policies are mandated or recommended by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, ratified by 182 countries, representing over 90% of the world's population.[86] The WHO groups these policies into six intervention categories, each of which has been shown to be effective in reducing the cost of tobacco-induced disease burden on a population: \n\n\n\n1. increasing the price of tobacco by raising taxes;\n2. banning tobacco use in public places to reduce exposure;\n3. banning tobacco advertisements;\n4. publicizing the dangers of tobacco products;\n5. instituting help programs for those attempting to quit smoking; and\n6. monitoring population-level tobacco use and the effectiveness of tobacco control policies.[87]\n\n\nPolicies implementing each intervention are associated with decreases in tobacco smoking prevalence. The more policies implemented, the greater the reduction.[88] Reducing access to tobacco for adolescents is particularly effective at decreasing uptake of habitual smoking, and adolescent demand for tobacco products is particularly sensitive to increases in cost.[89]\n\n\n\n### Diet and lifestyle[edit]\n\n\nSeveral foods and dietary supplements have been associated with lung cancer risk. High consumption of some animal products – red meat (but not other meats or fish), saturated fats, as well as nitrosamines and nitrites (found in salted and smoked meats) – is associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer.[90] In contrast, high consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer, particularly consumption of cruciferous vegetables and raw fruits and vegetables.[90] Based on the beneficial effects of fruits and vegetables, supplementation of several individual vitamins have been studied. Supplementation with vitamin A or beta-carotene had no effect on lung cancer, and instead slightly increased mortality.[90] Dietary supplementation with vitamin E or retinoids similarly had no effect.[91] Consumption of polyunsaturated fats, tea, alcoholic beverages, and coffee are all associated with reduced risk of developing lung cancer.[90]\n\n\nAlong with diet, body weight and exercise habits are also associated with lung cancer risk. Being overweight is associated with a lower risk of developing lung cancer, possibly due to the tendency of those who smoke cigarettes to have a lower body weight.[92] However, being underweight is also associated with a reduced lung cancer risk.[92] Some studies have shown those who exercise regularly or have better cardiovascular fitness to have a lower risk of developing lung cancer.[92]\n\n\n\n## Epidemiology[edit]\n\n\n![World map with countries in one of five colors](image)Age-standardized lung cancer incidence in 2020 per 100,000 people:[93] >40\n30–40\n20–30\n10–20\n<10\n\nWorldwide, lung cancer is the most diagnosed type of cancer, and the leading cause of cancer death.[94][95] In 2020, 2.2 million new cases were diagnosed, and 1.8 million people died from lung cancer, representing 18% of all cancer deaths.[3] Lung cancer deaths are expected to rise globally to nearly 3 million annual deaths by 2035, due to high rates of tobacco use and aging populations.[95] Lung cancer is rare in those younger than 40; after that, cancer rates increase with age, stabilizing around age 80.[1] The median age of a person diagnosed with lung cancer is 70; the median age of death is 72.[2]\n\n\nLung cancer incidence varies by geography and sex, with the highest rates in Micronesia, Polynesia, Europe, Asia, and North America; and lowest rates in Africa and Central America.[96] Globally, around 8% of men and 6% of women develop lung cancer in their lifetimes.[1] The ratio of lung cancer cases in men to women varies considerably by geography, from as high as nearly 12:1 in Belarus, to 1:1 in Brazil, likely due to differences in smoking patterns.[97]\n\n\nLung cancer risk is influenced by environmental exposure, namely cigarette smoking, as well as occupational risks in mining, shipbuilding, petroleum refining, and occupations that involve asbestos exposure.[97] People who have smoked cigarettes account for 85–90% of lung cancer cases, and 15% of smokers develop lung cancer.[97] Non-smokers' risk of developing lung cancer is also influenced by tobacco smoking; secondhand smoke (that is, being around tobacco smoke) increases risk of developing lung cancer around 30%, with risk correlated to duration of exposure.[97]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nLung cancer was uncommon before the advent of cigarette smoking. Surgeon Alton Ochsner recalled that as a Washington University medical student in 1919, his entire medical school class was summoned to witness an autopsy of a man who had died from lung cancer, and told they may never see such a case again.[98][99] In Isaac Adler's 1912 *Primary Malignant Growths of the Lungs and Bronchi*, he called lung cancer \"among the rarest forms of disease\";[100] Adler tabulated the 374 cases of lung cancer that had been published to that time, concluding the disease was increasing in incidence.[101] By the 1920s, several theories had been put forward linking the increase in lung cancer to various chemical exposures that had increased including tobacco smoke, asphalt dust, industrial air pollution, and poisonous gasses from World War I.[101]\n\n\nOver the following decades, growing scientific evidence linked lung cancer to cigarette consumption. Through the 1940s and early 1950s, several case-control studies showed that those with lung cancer were more likely to have smoked cigarettes compared to those without lung cancer.[102] These were followed by several prospective cohort studies in the 1950s – including the first report of the British Doctors Study in 1954 – all of which showed that those who smoked tobacco were at dramatically increased risk of developing lung cancer.[102]\n\n\n\n![Full page text advertisement](image)\"A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers\", an advertisement run in newspapers nationwide in January 1954 as part of Hill & Knowlton's campaign to cast doubt on the link between cigarettes and cancer\nA 1953 study showing that tar from cigarette smoke could cause tumors in mice attracted attention in the popular press, with features in *Life* and *Time* magazines. Facing public concern and falling stock prices, the CEOs of six of the largest American tobacco companies gathered in December 1953.[103] They enlisted the help of public relations firm Hill & Knowlton to craft a multi-pronged strategy aiming to distract from accumulating evidence by funding tobacco-friendly research, declaring the link to lung cancer \"controversial\", and demanding ever-more research to settle this purported controversy.[103][104] At the same time, internal research at the major tobacco companies supported the link between tobacco and lung cancer; though these results were kept secret from the public.[105]\n\n\nAs evidence linking tobacco use with lung cancer mounted, various health bodies announced official positions linking the two. In 1962, the United Kingdom's Royal College of Physicians officially concluded that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, prompting the United States Surgeon General to empanel an advisory committee, which deliberated in secret over nine sessions between November 1962 and December 1963.[106] The committee's report, published in January 1964, firmly concluded that cigarette smoking \"far outweighs all other factors\" in causing lung cancer.[107] The report received substantial coverage in the popular press, and is widely seen as a turning point for public recognition that tobacco smoking causes lung cancer.[106][108]\n\n\nThe connection with radon gas was first recognized among miners in Germany's Ore Mountains. As early as 1500, miners were noted to develop a deadly disease called \"mountain sickness\" (\"Bergkrankheit\"), identified as lung cancer by the late 19th century.[109][110] By 1938, up to 80% of miners in affected regions died from the disease.[109] In the 1950s radon and its breakdown products became established as causes of lung cancer in miners. Based largely on studies of miners, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified radon as \"carcinogenic to humans\" in 1988.[110] In 1956, a study revealed radon in Swedish residences. Over the following decades, high radon concentrations were found in residences across the world; by the 1980s many countries had established national radon programs to catalog and mitigate residential radon.[111]\n\n\nThe first successful pneumonectomy for lung cancer was performed in 1933 by Evarts Graham at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri.[112] Over the following decades, surgical development focused on sparing as much healthy lung tissue as possible, with the lobectomy surpassing the pneumectomy in frequency by the 1960s, and the wedge resection appearing in the early 1970s.[113][114] This trend continud with the development of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in the 1980s, now widely performed for many lung cancer surgeries.[115]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nWhile lung cancer is the deadliest type of cancer, it receives the third-most funding from the US National Cancer Institute (NCI, the world's largest cancer research funder) behind brain cancers and breast cancer.[116] Despite high levels of gross research funding, lung cancer funding per death lags behind many other cancers, with around $3,200 spent on lung cancer research in 2022 per US death, considerably lower than that for brain cancer ($22,000 per death), breast cancer ($14,000 per death), and cancer as a whole ($11,000 per death).[117] A similar trend holds for private nonprofit organizations. Annual revenues of lung cancer-focused nonprofits rank fifth among cancer types, but lung cancer nonprofits have lower revenue than would be expected for the number of lung cancer cases, deaths, and potential years of life lost.[118]\n\n\nDespite this, many investigational lung cancer treatments are undergoing clinical trials – with nearly 2,250 active clinical trials registered as of 2021.[119] Of these, a large plurality are testing radiotherapy regimens (26% of trials) and surgical techniques (22%). Many others are testing targeted anticancer drugs, with targets including EGFR (17% of trials), microtubules (12%), VEGF (12%), immune pathways (10%), mTOR (1%), and histone deacetylases (<1%).[120]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Horn & Iams 2022, \"Epidemiology\".\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Bade & Dela Cruz 2020, \"Age\".\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Sung et al. 2021, \"Lung cancer\".\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Rivera, Mody & Weiner 2022, \"Introduction\".\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** Pastis, Gonzalez & Silvestri 2022, \"Presentation/Initial Evaluation\".\n6. **^** Nasim, Sabath & Eapen 2019, \"Clinical Manifestations\".\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** Horn & Iams 2022, \"Clinical Manifestations\".\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Diagnosis – Lung Cancer\".

It was recommended starting at age 50 but it was changed to 45 due to increasing amount of colon cancers.[10][11] During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found.[2] If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk of pain during polyp excision.[2][12] Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects.[13]\n\n\nTreatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.[5] Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery, while cancer that has spread widely is usually not curable, with management being directed towards improving quality of life and symptoms.[5] The five-year survival rate in the United States was around 65% in 2014.[6] The individual likelihood of survival depends on how advanced the cancer is, whether or not all the cancer can be removed with surgery, and the person's overall health.[1] Globally, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer, making up about 10% of all cases.[14] In 2018, there were 1.09 million new cases and 551,000 deaths from the disease.[8] It is more common in developed countries, where more than 65% of cases are found.[2] It is less common in women than men.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms[edit]\n\n\nThe signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer depend on the location of the tumor in the bowel, and whether it has spread elsewhere in the body (metastasis). The classic warning signs include: worsening constipation, blood in the stool, decrease in stool caliber (thickness), loss of appetite, loss of weight, and nausea or vomiting in someone over 50 years old.[15] Around 50% of people who have colorectal cancer do not report any symptoms.[16]\n\n\nRectal bleeding or anemia are high-risk symptoms in people over the age of 50.[17] Weight loss and changes in a person's bowel habit are typically only concerning if they are associated with rectal bleeding.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## Cause[edit]\n\n\n75–95% of colorectal cancer cases occur in people with little or no genetic risk.[19][20] Risk factors include older age, male sex,[20] high intake of fat, sugar, alcohol, red meat, processed meats, obesity, smoking, and a lack of physical exercise.[19][21] The Rectal Cancer Survival Calculator developed by the MD Anderson Cancer Center additionally considers race to be a risk factor; however, there are equity issues concerning whether this might lead to inequity in clinical decision making.[22][23] Approximately 10% of cases are linked to insufficient activity.[24] The risk from alcohol appears to increase at greater than one drink per day.[25] Drinking five glasses of water a day is linked to a decrease in the risk of colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps.[26] *Streptococcus gallolyticus* is associated with colorectal cancer.[27] Some strains of *Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus* complex are consumed by millions of people daily and thus may be safe.[28] 25 to 80% of people with *Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus* bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors.[29] Seroprevalence of *Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus* is considered as a candidate practical marker for the early prediction of an underlying bowel lesion at high risk population.[29] It has been suggested that the presence of antibodies to *Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus* antigens or the antigens themselves in the bloodstream may act as markers for the carcinogenesis in the colon.[29]\n\n\nPathogenic *Escherichia coli* may increase the risk of colorectal cancer by producing the genotoxic metabolite, colibactin.[30]\n\n\n\n### Inflammatory bowel disease[edit]\n\n\nPeople with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are at increased risk of colon cancer.[31][32] The risk increases the longer a person has the disease, and the worse the severity of inflammation.[33] In these high risk groups, both prevention with aspirin and regular colonoscopies are recommended.[34] Endoscopic surveillance in this high-risk population may reduce the development of colorectal cancer through early diagnosis and may also reduce the chances of dying from colon cancer.[34] People with inflammatory bowel disease account for less than 2% of colon cancer cases yearly.[33] In those with Crohn's disease, 2% get colorectal cancer after 10 years, 8% after 20 years, and 18% after 30 years.[33] In people who have ulcerative colitis, approximately 16% develop either a cancer precursor or cancer of the colon over 30 years.[33]\n\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nThose with a family history in two or more first-degree relatives (such as a parent or sibling) have a two to threefold greater risk of disease, and this group accounts for about 20% of all cases. A number of genetic syndromes are also associated with higher rates of colorectal cancer. The most common of these is hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, or Lynch syndrome) which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer.[20] Other syndromes that are strongly associated with colorectal cancer include Gardner syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).[35] For people with these syndromes, cancer almost always occurs and makes up 1% of the cancer cases.[36] A total proctocolectomy may be recommended for people with FAP as a preventive measure due to the high risk of malignancy. Colectomy, removal of the colon, may not suffice as a preventive measure because of the high risk of rectal cancer if the rectum remains.[37] The most common polyposis syndrome affecting the colon is serrated polyposis syndrome,[38] which is associated with a 25-40% risk of CRC.[39]\n\n\nMutations in the pair of genes (POLE and POLD1) have been associated with familial colon cancer.[40]\n\n\nMost deaths due to colon cancer are associated with metastatic disease. A gene that appears to contribute to the potential for metastatic disease, metastasis associated in colon cancer 1 (*MACC1*), has been isolated.[41] It is a transcriptional factor that influences the expression of hepatocyte growth factor. This gene is associated with the proliferation, invasion, and scattering of colon cancer cells in cell culture, and tumor growth and metastasis in mice. MACC1 may be a potential target for cancer intervention, but this possibility needs to be confirmed with clinical studies.[42]\n\n\nEpigenetic factors, such as abnormal DNA methylation of tumor suppressor promoters, play a role in the development of colorectal cancer.[43]\n\n\nAshkenazi Jews have a 6% higher risk rate of getting adenomas and then colon cancer due to mutations in the APC gene being more common.[44]\n\n\n\n## Pathogenesis[edit]\n\n\nColorectal cancer is a disease originating from the epithelial cells lining the colon or rectum of the gastrointestinal tract, most frequently as a result of genetic mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway that increases signaling activity.[45] The Wnt signaling pathway normally plays an important role for normal function of these cells including maintaining this lining. Mutations can be inherited or acquired, and most probably occur in the intestinal crypt stem cell.[46][47][48] The most commonly mutated gene in all colorectal cancer is the *APC* gene, which produces the APC protein.[45] The APC protein prevents the accumulation of β-catenin protein. Without APC, β-catenin accumulates to high levels and translocates (moves) into the nucleus, binds to DNA, and activates the transcription of proto-oncogenes. These genes are normally important for stem cell renewal and differentiation, but when inappropriately expressed at high levels, they can cause cancer.[45] While APC is mutated in most colon cancers, some cancers have increased β-catenin because of mutations in β-catenin (CTNNB1) that block its own breakdown, or have mutations in other genes with function similar to APC such as AXIN1, AXIN2, TCF7L2, or NKD1.[49]\n\n\nBeyond the defects in the Wnt signaling pathway, other mutations must occur for the cell to become cancerous. The p53 protein, produced by the *TP53* gene, normally monitors cell division and induces their programmed death if they have Wnt pathway defects. Eventually, a cell line acquires a mutation in the *TP53* gene and transforms the tissue from a benign epithelial tumor into an invasive epithelial cell cancer. Sometimes the gene encoding p53 is not mutated, but another protective protein named BAX is mutated instead.[49]\n\n\nOther proteins responsible for programmed cell death that are commonly deactivated in colorectal cancers are TGF-β and DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer). TGF-β has a deactivating mutation in at least half of colorectal cancers. Sometimes TGF-β is not deactivated, but a downstream protein named SMAD is deactivated.[49] DCC commonly has a deleted segment of a chromosome in colorectal cancer.[50]\n\n\nApproximately 70% of all human genes are expressed in colorectal cancer, with just over 1% of having increased expression in colorectal cancer compared to other forms of cancer.[51] Some genes are oncogenes: they are overexpressed in colorectal cancer. For example, genes encoding the proteins KRAS, RAF, and PI3K, which normally stimulate the cell to divide in response to growth factors, can acquire mutations that result in over-activation of cell proliferation. The chronological order of mutations is sometimes important. If a previous APC mutation occurred, a primary KRAS mutation often progresses to cancer rather than a self-limiting hyperplastic or borderline lesion.[52] PTEN, a tumor suppressor, normally inhibits PI3K, but can sometimes become mutated and deactivated.[49]\n\n\nComprehensive, genome-scale analysis has revealed that colorectal carcinomas can be categorized into hypermutated and non-hypermutated tumor types.[53] In addition to the oncogenic and inactivating mutations described for the genes above, non-hypermutated samples also contain mutated CTNNB1, FAM123B, SOX9, ATM, and ARID1A. Progressing through a distinct set of genetic events, hypermutated tumors display mutated forms of ACVR2A, TGFBR2, MSH3, MSH6, SLC9A9, TCF7L2, and BRAF. The common theme among these genes, across both tumor types, is their involvement in Wnt and TGF-β signaling pathways, which results in increased activity of MYC, a central player in colorectal cancer.[53]\n\n\nMismatch repair (MMR) deficient tumours are characterized by a relatively high amount of poly-nucleotide tandem repeats.[54] This is caused by a deficiency in MMR proteins – which are typically caused by epigenetic silencing and or inherited mutations (*e.g.*, Lynch syndrome).[55] 15 to 18 percent of colorectal cancer tumours have MMR deficiencies, with 3 percent developing due to Lynch syndrome.[56] The role of the mismatch repair system is to protect the integrity of the genetic material within cells (*i.e.*, error detecting and correcting).[55] Consequently, a deficiency in MMR proteins may lead to an inability to detect and repair genetic damage, allowing for further cancer-causing mutations to occur and colorectal cancer to progress.[55]\n\n\nThe polyp to cancer progression sequence is the classical model of colorectal cancer pathogenesis.[57] In this **adenoma-carcinoma sequence**, [58] normal epithelial cells proress to dysplastic cells such as adenomas, and then to carcinoma, by a process of progressive genetic mutation.[59] Central to the polyp to CRC sequence are gene mutations, epigenetic alterations, and local inflammatory changes.[57] The polyp to CRC sequence can be used as an underlying framework to illustrate how specific molecular changes lead to various cancer subtypes.[57]\n\n\n\n### Field defects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Longitudinally opened freshly resected colon segment showing a cancer and four polyps. Plus a schematic diagram indicating a likely field defect (a region of tissue that precedes and predisposes to the development of cancer) in this colon segment. The diagram indicates sub-clones and sub-sub-clones that were precursors to the tumors.\nThe term \"field cancerization\" was first used in 1953 to describe an area or \"field\" of epithelium that has been preconditioned (by what were largely unknown processes at the time) to predispose it towards development of cancer.[60] Since then, the terms \"field cancerization\", \"field carcinogenesis\", \"field defect\", and \"field effect\" have been used to describe pre-malignant or pre-neoplastic tissue in which new cancers are likely to arise.[61]\n\n\nField defects are important in progression to colon cancer.[62][63]\n\n\nHowever, as pointed out by Rubin, \"The vast majority of studies in cancer research has been done on well-defined tumors *in vivo*, or on discrete neoplastic foci *in vitro*. Yet there is evidence that more than 80% of the somatic mutations found in mutator phenotype human colorectal tumors occur before the onset of terminal clonal expansion.\"[64][65] Similarly, Vogelstein et al.[66] pointed out that more than half of somatic mutations identified in tumors occurred in a pre-neoplastic phase (in a field defect), during growth of apparently normal cells. Likewise, epigenetic alterations present in tumors may have occurred in pre-neoplastic field defects.[67]\n\n\nAn expanded view of field effect has been termed \"etiologic field effect\", which encompasses not only molecular and pathologic changes in pre-neoplastic cells but also influences of exogenous environmental factors and molecular changes in the local microenvironment on neoplastic evolution from tumor initiation to death.[68]\n\n\n\n### Epigenetics[edit]\n\n\nEpigenetic alterations are much more frequent in colon cancer than genetic (mutational) alterations. As described by Vogelstein et al.,[66] an average cancer of the colon has only 1 or 2 oncogene mutations and 1 to 5 tumor suppressor mutations (together designated \"driver mutations\"), with about 60 further \"passenger\" mutations. The oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are well studied and are described above under Pathogenesis.[69][70]\n\n\nIn addition to epigenetic alteration of expression of miRNAs, other common types of epigenetic alterations in cancers that change gene expression levels include direct hypermethylation or hypomethylation of CpG islands of protein-encoding genes and alterations in histones and chromosomal architecture that influence gene expression.[71] As an example, 147 hypermethylations and 27 hypomethylations of protein coding genes were frequently associated with colorectal cancers. Of the hypermethylated genes, 10 were hypermethylated in 100% of colon cancers, and many others were hypermethylated in more than 50% of colon cancers.[72] In addition, 11 hypermethylations and 96 hypomethylations of miRNAs were also associated with colorectal cancers.[72] Abnormal (aberrant) methylation occurs as a normal consequence of normal aging and the risk of colorectal cancer increases as a person gets older.[73] The source and trigger of this age-related methylation is unknown.[73][74] Approximately half of the genes that show age-related methylation changes are the same genes that have been identified to be involved in the development of colorectal cancer.[73] These findings may suggest a reason for age being associated with the increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.[73]\n\n\nEpigenetic reductions of DNA repair enzyme expression may likely lead to the genomic and epigenomic instability characteristic of cancer.[75][76][67] As summarized in the articles Carcinogenesis and Neoplasm, for sporadic cancers in general, a deficiency in DNA repair is occasionally due to a mutation in a DNA repair gene, but is much more frequently due to epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes.[77]\n\n\nEpigenetic alterations involved in the development of colorectal cancer may affect a person's response to chemotherapy.[78]\n\n\n\n### Genomics | Epigenomics[edit]\n\n\nConsensus molecular subtypes (CMS) classification of colorectal cancer was first introduced in 2015. CMS classification so far has been considered the most robust classification system available for CRC that has a clear biological interpretability and the basis for future clinical stratification and subtype-based targeted interventions.[79]\n\n\nA novel Epigenome-based Classification (EpiC) of colorectal cancer was proposed in 2021 introducing 4 enhancer subtypes in people with CRC. Chromatin states using 6 histone marks are characterized to identify EpiC subtypes. A combinatorial therapeutic approach based on the previously introduced consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) and EpiCs could significantly enhance current treatment strategies.[80]\n\n\n\n## Diagnosis[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Colon cancer with extensive metastases to the liver\nColorectal cancer diagnosis is performed by sampling of areas of the colon suspicious for possible tumor development, typically during colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, depending on the location of the lesion.[20] It is confirmed by microscopical examination of a tissue sample.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Medical imaging[edit]\n\n\nA colorectal cancer is sometimes initially discovered on CT scan.[81]\n\n\nPresence of metastases is determined by a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.[20] Other potential imaging tests such as PET and MRI may be used in certain cases.[20] MRI is particularly useful to determine local stage of the tumor and to plan the optimal surgical approach.[81]\n\n\nMRI is also performed after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to identify patients who achieve complete response. Patients with complete response on both MRI and endoscopy may not require surgical resection and can avoid unnecessary surgical morbidity and complications.[82] Patients selected for non-surgical treatment of rectal cancer should have periodic MRI scans, receive physical examinations, and undergo endoscopy procedures to detect any tumor re-growth which can occur in a minority of these patients. When local recurrence occurs, periodic follow up can detect it when it is still small and curable with salvage surgery. In addition, MRI tumor regression grades can be assigned after chemoradiotherapy which correlate with patients' long-term survival outcomes.[83]\n\n\n\n### Histopathology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Relative incidence of various histopathological types of colorectal cancer. The vast majority of colorectal cancers are adenocarcinomas.[84]\n![](image)Micrograph of colorectal adenocarcinoma, showing \"dirty necrosis\".\nFurther information: Histopathology of colorectal adenocarcinoma\n\nThe histopathologic characteristics of the tumor are reported from the analysis of tissue taken from a biopsy or surgery. A pathology report contains a description of the microscopical characteristics of the tumor tissue, including both tumor cells and how the tumor invades into healthy tissues and finally if the tumor appears to be completely removed. The most common form of colon cancer is adenocarcinoma, constituting between 95%[85] and 98%[86] of all cases of colorectal cancer. Other, rarer types include lymphoma, adenosquamous and squamous cell carcinoma. Some subtypes are more aggressive.[87] Immunohistochemistry may be used in uncertain cases.[88]\n\n\n\n### Staging[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colon cancer staging\n\nStaging of the cancer is based on both radiological and pathological findings. As with most other forms of cancer, tumor staging is based on the TNM system which considers how much the initial tumor has spread and the presence of metastases in lymph nodes and more distant organs.[20] The AJCC 8th edition was published in 2018.[89]\n\n\n\n## Prevention[edit]\n\n\nIt has been estimated that about half of colorectal cancer cases are due to lifestyle factors, and about a quarter of all cases are preventable.[90] Increasing surveillance, engaging in physical activity, consuming a diet high in fiber, and reducing smoking and alcohol consumption decrease the risk.[91][92]\n\n\n\n### Lifestyle[edit]\n\n\nLifestyle risk factors with strong evidence include lack of exercise, cigarette smoking, alcohol, and obesity.[93][94][95] The risk of colon cancer can be reduced by maintaining a normal body weight through a combination of sufficient exercise and eating a healthy diet.[96]\n\n\nCurrent research consistently links eating more red meat and processed meat to a higher risk of the disease.[97] Starting in the 1970s, dietary recommendations to prevent colorectal cancer often included increasing the consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and reducing the intake of red meat and processed meats. This was based on animal studies and retrospective observational studies. However, large scale prospective studies have failed to demonstrate a significant protective effect, and due to the multiple causes of cancer and the complexity of studying correlations between diet and health, it is uncertain whether any specific dietary interventions will have significant protective effects.[98]: 432–433[99]: 125–126 In 2018 the National Cancer Institute stated that \"There is no reliable evidence that a diet started in adulthood that is low in fat and meat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables reduces the risk of CRC by a clinically important degree.\"[93][100]\n\n\nAccording to the World Cancer Research Fund, consuming alcohol drinks and consuming processed meat both increase the risk of colorectal cancer.[101]\n\n\nThe 2014 World Health Organization cancer report noted that it has been hypothesized that dietary fiber might help prevent colorectal cancer, but that most studies at the time had not yet studied the correlation.[99] A 2019 review, however, found evidence of benefit from dietary fiber and whole grains.[102] The World Cancer Research Fund listed the benefit of fiber for prevention of colorectal cancer as \"probable\" as of 2017.[103] A 2022 umbrella review says there is \"convincing evidence\" for that association.[104]\n\n\nHigher physical activity is recommended.[21][105] Physical exercise is associated with a modest reduction in colon but not rectal cancer risk.[106][107] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of colon cancer by about 21%.[108] Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from colon cancer. Regular exercise does not negate the risk but does lower it.[109]\n\n\n\n### Medication and supplements[edit]\n\n\nAspirin and celecoxib appear to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer in those at high risk.[110][111] Aspirin is recommended in those who are 50 to 60 years old, do not have an increased risk of bleeding, and are at risk for cardiovascular disease to prevent colorectal cancer.[112] It is not recommended in those at average risk.[113]\n\n\nThere is tentative evidence for calcium supplementation, but it is not sufficient to make a recommendation.[114] Vitamin D intake and blood levels are associated with a lower risk of colon cancer.[115][116]\n\n\n\n### Screening[edit]\n\n\nAs more than 80% of colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps, screening for this cancer is effective for both early detection and for prevention.[20][117] Diagnosis of cases of colorectal cancer through screening tends to occur 2–3 years before diagnosis of cases with symptoms.[20] Any polyps that are detected can be removed, usually by colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, and thus prevent them from turning into cancer. Screening has the potential to reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 60%.[118]\n\n\nThe three main screening tests are colonoscopy, fecal occult blood testing, and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Of the three, only sigmoidoscopy cannot screen the right side of the colon where 42% of cancers are found.[119] Flexible sigmoidoscopy, however, has the best evidence for decreasing the risk of death from any cause.[120]\n\n\nFecal occult blood testing (FOBT) of the stool is typically recommended every two years and can be either guaiac-based or immunochemical.[20] If abnormal FOBT results are found, participants are typically referred for a follow-up colonoscopy examination. When done once every 1–2 years, FOBT screening reduces colorectal cancer deaths by 16% and among those participating in screening, colorectal cancer deaths can be reduced up to 23%, although it has not been proven to reduce all-cause mortality.[121] Immunochemical tests are accurate and do not require dietary or medication changes before testing.[122] However, research in the UK has found that for these immunochemical tests, the threshold for further investigation is set at a point that may miss more than half of bowel cancer cases. The research suggests that the NHS England's Bowel Cancer Screening Programme could make better use of the test's ability to provide the exact concentration of blood in faeces (rather than only whether it is above or below a cutoff level).[123][124]\n\n\nOther options include virtual colonoscopy and stool DNA screening testing (FIT-DNA). Virtual colonoscopy via a CT scan appears as good as standard colonoscopy for detecting cancers and large adenomas but is expensive, associated with radiation exposure, and cannot remove any detected abnormal growths as standard colonoscopy can.[20] Stool DNA screening test looks for biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and precancerous lesions, including altered DNA and blood hemoglobin. A positive result should be followed by colonoscopy. FIT-DNA has more false positives than FIT and thus results in more adverse effects.[10] Further study is required as of 2016 to determine whether a three-year screening interval is correct.[10]\n\n\n\n#### Recommendations[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, screening is typically recommended between ages 50 and 75 years.[10][125] The American Cancer Society recommends starting at the age of 45.[126] For those between 76 and 85 years old, the decision to screen should be individualized.[10] For those at high risk, screenings usually begin at around 40.[20][127]\n\n\nSeveral screening methods are recommended including stool-based tests every 2 years, sigmoidoscopy every 10 years with fecal immunochemical testing every two years, and colonoscopy every 10 years.[125] It is unclear which of these two methods is better.[128] Colonoscopy may find more cancers in the first part of the colon, but is associated with greater cost and more complications.[128] For people with average risk who have had a high-quality colonoscopy with normal results, the American Gastroenterological Association does not recommend any type of screening in the 10 years following the colonoscopy.[129][130] For people over 75 or those with a life expectancy of less than 10 years, screening is not recommended.[131] It takes about 10 years after screening for one out of a 1000 people to benefit.[132] The USPSTF list seven potential strategies for screening, with the most important thing being that at least one of these strategies is appropriately used.[10]\n\n\nIn Canada, among those 50 to 75 years old at normal risk, fecal immunochemical testing or FOBT is recommended every two years or sigmoidoscopy every 10 years.[133] Colonoscopy is less preferred.[133]\n\n\nSome countries have national colorectal screening programs which offer FOBT screening for all adults within a certain age group, typically starting between ages 50 and 60. Examples of countries with organised screening include the United Kingdom,[134] Australia,[135] the Netherlands,[136] Hong Kong, and Taiwan.[137]\n\n\nThe UK Bowel Cancer Screening Programme aims to find warning signs in people aged 60 to 74, by recommending a faecal immunochemical test (FIT) every two years. FIT measures blood in faeces, and people with levels above a certain threshold may have bowel tissue examined for signs of cancer. Growths having cancerous potential are removed.[138][124]\n\n\n\n## Treatment[edit]\n\n\nThe treatment of colorectal cancer can be aimed at cure or palliation. The decision on which aim to adopt depends on various factors, including the person's health and preferences, as well as the stage of the tumor.[139] Assessment in multidisciplinary teams is a critical part of determining whether the patient is suitable for surgery or not.[140] When colorectal cancer is caught early, surgery can be curative. However, when it is detected at later stages (for which metastases are present), this is less likely and treatment is often directed at palliation, to relieve symptoms caused by the tumour and keep the person as comfortable as possible.[20]\n\n\n\n### Surgery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A diagram of a local resection of early stage colon cancer\n![](image)A diagram of local surgery for rectal cancer\nAt an early stage, colorectal cancer may be removed during a colonoscopy using one of several techniques, including endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection.[5] Endoscopic resection is possible if there is low possibility of lymph node metastasis and the size and location of the tumor make en bloc resection possible.[141] For people with localized cancer, the preferred treatment is complete surgical removal with adequate margins, with the attempt of achieving a cure. The procedure of choice is a partial colectomy (or proctocolectomy for rectal lesions) where the affected part of the colon or rectum is removed along with parts of its mesocolon and blood supply to facilitate removal of draining lymph nodes. This can be done either by an open laparotomy or laparoscopically, depending on factors related to the individual person and lesion factors.[20] The colon may then be reconnected or a person may have a colostomy.[5]\n\n\nIf there are only a few metastases in the liver or lungs, these may also be removed. Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the cancer before attempting to remove it. The two most common sites of recurrence of colorectal cancer are the liver and lungs.[20] For peritoneal carcinomatosis cytoreductive surgery, sometimes in combination with HIPEC can be used in an attempt to remove the cancer.[142]\n\n\n\n### Chemotherapy[edit]\n\n\nIn both cancer of the colon and rectum, chemotherapy may be used in addition to surgery in certain cases. The decision to add chemotherapy in management of colon and rectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease.[143]\n\n\nIn Stage I colon cancer, no chemotherapy is offered, and surgery is the definitive treatment. The role of chemotherapy in Stage II colon cancer is debatable, and is usually not offered unless risk factors such as T4 tumor, undifferentiated tumor, vascular and perineural invasion or inadequate lymph node sampling is identified.[144] It is also known that the people who carry abnormalities of the mismatch repair genes do not benefit from chemotherapy. For stage III and Stage IV colon cancer, chemotherapy is an integral part of treatment.[20]\n\n\nIf cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs, which is the case with stage III and stage IV colon cancer respectively, adding chemotherapy agents fluorouracil, capecitabine or oxaliplatin increases life expectancy. If the lymph nodes do not contain cancer, the benefits of chemotherapy are controversial. If the cancer is widely metastatic or unresectable, treatment is then palliative. Typically in this setting, a number of different chemotherapy medications may be used.[20] Chemotherapy drugs for this condition may include capecitabine, fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and UFT.[145] The drugs capecitabine and fluorouracil are interchangeable, with capecitabine being an oral medication and fluorouracil being an intravenous medicine. Some specific regimens used for CRC are CAPOX, FOLFOX, FOLFOXIRI, and FOLFIRI.[146] Antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab are often added in first line therapy.[*citation needed*] Another class of drugs used in the second line setting are epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, of which the three FDA approved ones are aflibercept, cetuximab and panitumumab.[147][148]\n\n\nThe primary difference in the approach to low stage rectal cancer is the incorporation of radiation therapy. Often, it is used in conjunction with chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant fashion to enable surgical resection, so that ultimately a colostomy is not required. However, it may not be possible in low lying tumors, in which case, a permanent colostomy may be required. Stage IV rectal cancer is treated similar to stage IV colon cancer.\n\n\nStage IV colorectal cancer due to peritoneal carcinomatosis can be treated using HIPEC combined with cytoreductive surgery, in some people.[149][150][151] Also, T4 colorectal cancer can be treated with HIPEC to avoid future relapses.[152]\n\n\n\n### Radiation therapy[edit]\n\n\nWhile a combination of radiation and chemotherapy may be useful for rectal cancer,[20] for some people requiring treatment, chemoradiotherapy can increase acute treatment-related toxicity, and has not been shown to improve survival rates compared to radiotherapy alone, although it is associated with less local recurrence.[142] The use of radiotherapy in colon cancer is not routine due to the sensitivity of the bowels to radiation.[153] As with chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used as a neoadjuvant for clinical stages T3 and T4 for rectal cancer.[154] This results in downsizing or downstaging of the tumour, preparing it for surgical resection, and also decreases local recurrence rates.[154] For locally advanced rectal cancer, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment.[155] Additionally, when surgery is not possible radiation therapy has been suggested to be an effective treatment against CRC pulmonary metastases, which are developed by 10-15% of people with CRC.[156]\n\n\n\n### Immunotherapy[edit]\n\n\nImmunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has been found to be useful for a type of colorectal cancer with mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability.[157][158] Pembrolizumab is approved for advanced CRC tumours that are MMR deficient and have failed usual treatments.[159] Most people who do improve, however, still worsen after months or years.[158]\n\n\nOn the other hand, in a prospective phase 2 study published in June 2022 in The New England Journal of Medicine, 12 patients with Deficient Mismatch Repair (dMMR) stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma were administered single-agent dostarlimab, an anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody, every three weeks for six months. After a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 6 to 25 months), all 12 patients had a complete clinical response with no evidence of tumor on MRI, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron-emission tomography, endoscopic evaluation, digital rectal examination, or biopsy. Moreover, no patient in the trial needed chemoradiotherapy or surgery, and no patient reported adverse events of grade 3 or higher. However, although the results of this study are promising, the study is small and has uncertainties about long-term outcomes.[160]\n\n\n\n### Palliative care[edit]\n\n\nPalliative care is recommended for any person who has advanced colon cancer or who has significant symptoms.[161][162]\n\n\nInvolvement of palliative care may be beneficial to improve the quality of life for both the person and his or her family, by improving symptoms, anxiety and preventing admissions to the hospital.[163]\n\n\nIn people with incurable colorectal cancer, palliative care can consist of procedures that relieve symptoms or complications from the cancer but do not attempt to cure the underlying cancer, thereby improving quality of life. Surgical options may include non-curative surgical removal of some of the cancer tissue, bypassing part of the intestines, or stent placement. These procedures can be considered to improve symptoms and reduce complications such as bleeding from the tumor, abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction.[164] Non-operative methods of symptomatic treatment include radiation therapy to decrease tumor size as well as pain medications.[165]\n\n\n\n### Follow-up[edit]\n\n\nThe U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Society of Clinical Oncology provide guidelines for the follow-up of colon cancer.[166][167] A medical history and physical examination are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 5 years. Carcinoembryonic antigen blood level measurements follow the same timing, but are only advised for people with T2 or greater lesions who are candidates for intervention. A CT-scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can be considered annually for the first 3 years for people who are at high risk of recurrence (for example, those who had poorly differentiated tumors or venous or lymphatic invasion) and are candidates for curative surgery (with the aim to cure). A colonoscopy can be done after 1 year, except if it could not be done during the initial staging because of an obstructing mass, in which case it should be performed after 3 to 6 months. If a villous polyp, a polyp >1 centimeter or high-grade dysplasia is found, it can be repeated after 3 years, then every 5 years. For other abnormalities, the colonoscopy can be repeated after 1 year.[143]\n\n\nRoutine PET or ultrasound scanning, chest X-rays, complete blood count or liver function tests are not recommended.[166][167]\n\n\nFor people who have undergone curative surgery or adjuvant therapy (or both) to treat non-metastatic colorectal cancer, intense surveillance and close follow-up have not been shown to provide additional survival benefits.[168]\n\n\n\n### Exercise[edit]\n\n\nExercise may be recommended in the future as secondary therapy to cancer survivors. In epidemiological studies, exercise may decrease colorectal cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. Results for the specific amounts of exercise needed to observe a benefit were conflicting. These differences may reflect differences in tumour biology and the expression of biomarkers. People with tumors that lacked CTNNB1 expression (β-catenin), involved in Wnt signalling pathway, required more than 18 Metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week, a measure of exercise, to observe a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. The mechanism of how exercise benefits survival may be involved in immune surveillance and inflammation pathways. In clinical studies, a pro-inflammatory response was found in people with stage II-III colorectal cancer who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after completing their primary therapy. Oxidative balance may be another possible mechanism for benefits observed. A significant decrease in 8-oxo-dG was found in the urine of people who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after primary therapy. Other possible mechanisms may involve metabolic hormone and sex-steroid hormones, although these pathways may be involved in other types of cancers.[169][170]\n\n\nAnother potential biomarker may be p27. Survivors with tumors that expressed p27 and performed greater and equal to 18 MET hours per week were found to have reduced colorectal cancer mortality survival compared to those with less than 18 MET hours per week. Survivors without p27 expression who exercised were shown to have worse outcomes. The constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway may explain the loss of p27 and excess energy balance may up-regulate p27 to stop cancer cells from dividing.[170]\n\n\nPhysical activity provides benefits to people with non-advanced colorectal cancer. Improvements in aerobic fitness, cancer-related fatigue and health-related quality of life have been reported in the short term.[171] However, these improvements were not observed at the level of disease-related mental health, such as anxiety and depression.[171]\n\n\n\n## Prognosis[edit]\n\n\nFewer than 600 genes are linked to outcomes in colorectal cancer.[51] These include both unfavorable genes, where high expression is related to poor outcome, for example the heat shock 70 kDa protein 1 (HSPA1A), and favorable genes where high expression is associated with better survival, for example the putative RNA-binding protein 3 (RBM3).[51] The prognosis is also correlated with a poor fidelity of the pre-mRNA splicing apparatus, and thus a high number of deviating alternative splicing.[172]\n\n\n\n### Recurrence rates[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cancer recurrence § Rectal cancer\n\nThe average five-year recurrence rate in people where surgery is successful is 5% for stage I cancers, 12% in stage II and 33% in stage III. However, depending on the number of risk factors it ranges from 9–22% in stage II and 17–44% in stage III.[173]\n\n\n\n### Survival rates[edit]\n\n\nIn Europe the five-year survival rate for colorectal cancer is less than 60%. In the developed world about a third of people who get the disease die from it.[20]\n\n\nSurvival is directly related to detection and the type of cancer involved, but overall is poor for symptomatic cancers, as they are typically quite advanced. Survival rates for early stage detection are about five times that of late stage cancers. People with a tumor that has not breached the muscularis mucosa (TNM stage Tis, N0, M0) have a five-year survival rate of 100%, while those with invasive cancer of T1 (within the submucosal layer) or T2 (within the muscular layer) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 90%. Those with a more invasive tumor yet without node involvement (T3-4, N0, M0) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 70%. People with positive regional lymph nodes (any T, N1-3, M0) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 40%, while those with distant metastases (any T, any N, M1) have a poor prognosis and the five year survival ranges from <5 percent to 31 percent.[174][175][176][177][178] The prognosis depends on a multitude of factors which include the physical fitness level of the person, extent of metastases, and tumor grade.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWhilst the impact of colorectal cancer on those who survive varies greatly there will often be a need to adapt to both physical and psychological outcomes of the illness and its treatment.[179] For example, it is common for people to experience incontinence,[180] sexual dysfunction,[181] problems with stoma care[182] and fear of cancer recurrence[183] after primary treatment has concluded.\n\n\nA qualitative systematic review published in 2021 highlighted that there are three main factors influencing adaptation to living with and beyond colorectal cancer: support mechanisms, severity of late effects of treatment and psychosocial adjustment. Therefore, it is essential that people are offered appropriate support to help them better adapt to life following treatment.[184]\n\n\n\n## Epidemiology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Colon and rectum cancer deaths per million persons in 2012 3–17\n18–21\n22–27\n28–36\n37–54\n55–77\n78–162\n163–244\n245–329\n330–533\n\nGlobally more than 1 million people get colorectal cancer every year[20] resulting in about 715,000 deaths as of 2010 up from 490,000 in 1990.[185]\n\n\nAs of 2012[update], it is the second most common cause of cancer in women (9.2% of diagnoses) and the third most common in men (10.0%)[14]: 16 with it being the fourth most common cause of cancer death after lung, stomach, and liver cancer.[186] It is more common in developed than developing countries.[187] Global incidence varies 10-fold, with highest rates in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the US and lowest rates in Africa and South-Central Asia.[188]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, the incidence of colorectal cancer in the United States was anticipated to be about 151,000 adults, including over 106,000 new cases of colon cancer (some 54,000 men and 52,000 women) and about 45,000 new cases of rectal cancer.[189] Since the 1980s, the incidence of colorectal cancer decreased, dropping by about 2% annually from 2014 to 2018 in adults aged 50 and older, due mainly to improved screening.[189] However, incidence of colorectal cancer has increased in individuals aged 25 to 50. In early 2023, the American Cancer Society (ACS) reported that 20% of diagnoses (of colon cancer) in 2019 were in patients under age 55, which is about double the rate in 1995, and rates of advanced disease increased by about 3% annually in people younger than 50. It predicted that, in 2023, an estimated 19,550 diagnoses and 3,750 deaths would be in people younger than 50.[190] Colorectal cancer also disproportionately affects the Black community, where the rates are the highest of any racial/ethnic group in the US. African Americans are about 20% more likely to get colorectal cancer and about 40% more likely to die from it than most other groups. Black Americans often experience greater obstacles to cancer prevention, detection, treatment, and survival, including systemic racial disparities that are complex and go beyond the obvious connection to cancer.\n\n\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\nIn the UK about 41,000 people a year get colon cancer making it the fourth most common type.[191]\n\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\nOne in 19 men and one in 28 women in Australia will develop colorectal cancer before the age of 75; one in 10 men and one in 15 women will develop it by 85 years of age.[192]\n\n\n\n### Papua New Guinea[edit]\n\n\nIn the developing countries like Papua New Guinea and other Pacific Island States including the Solomon Islands, colorectal cancer is a very rare cancer amongst the people, which is least common compared to lung, stomach, liver or breast cancer. It is estimated that at least 8 in 100,000 of the people are most likely to developed colorectal cancer every year, which is unlike lung or breast cancer, where for the latter alone is 24 in 100,000 of the women folks alone.[193]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nRectal cancer has been diagnosed in an Ancient Egyptian mummy who had lived in the Dakhleh Oasis during the Ptolemaic period.[194]\n\n\n\n## Society and culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people diagnosed with colorectal cancer\n\nIn the United States, March is colorectal cancer awareness month.[118]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nPreliminary in-vitro evidence suggests lactic acid bacteria (e.g., lactobacilli, streptococci or lactococci) may be protective against the development and progression of colorectal cancer through several mechanisms such as antioxidant activity, immunomodulation, promoting programmed cell death, antiproliferative effects, and epigenetic modification of cancer cells.[195]\n\n\nMouse models of colorectal and intestinal cancer have been developed and are used in research.[196][197][198]\n\n\n\n* The Cancer Genome Atlas[53]\n* The Colorectal Cancer Atlas integrating genomic and proteomic data pertaining to colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines have been developed.[199]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Fecal occult blood\n* Adenoma-carcinoma sequence\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"General Information About Colon Cancer\". *NCI*.

The variation in findings from prospective studies needs to be better understood; dietary fibre is complex and heterogeneous, and the relation with colorectal cancer could differ by dietary source.

It was recommended starting at age 50 but it was changed to 45 due to increasing amount of colon cancers.[10][11] During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found.[2] If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk of pain during polyp excision.[2][12] Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects.[13]\n\n\nTreatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.[5] Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery, while cancer that has spread widely is usually not curable, with management being directed towards improving quality of life and symptoms.[5] The five-year survival rate in the United States was around 65% in 2014.[6] The individual likelihood of survival depends on how advanced the cancer is, whether or not all the cancer can be removed with surgery, and the person's overall health.[1] Globally, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer, making up about 10% of all cases.[14] In 2018, there were 1.09 million new cases and 551,000 deaths from the disease.[8] It is more common in developed countries, where more than 65% of cases are found.[2] It is less common in women than men.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms[edit]\n\n\nThe signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer depend on the location of the tumor in the bowel, and whether it has spread elsewhere in the body (metastasis). The classic warning signs include: worsening constipation, blood in the stool, decrease in stool caliber (thickness), loss of appetite, loss of weight, and nausea or vomiting in someone over 50 years old.[15] Around 50% of people who have colorectal cancer do not report any symptoms.[16]\n\n\nRectal bleeding or anemia are high-risk symptoms in people over the age of 50.[17] Weight loss and changes in a person's bowel habit are typically only concerning if they are associated with rectal bleeding.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## Cause[edit]\n\n\n75–95% of colorectal cancer cases occur in people with little or no genetic risk.[19][20] Risk factors include older age, male sex,[20] high intake of fat, sugar, alcohol, red meat, processed meats, obesity, smoking, and a lack of physical exercise.[19][21] The Rectal Cancer Survival Calculator developed by the MD Anderson Cancer Center additionally considers race to be a risk factor; however, there are equity issues concerning whether this might lead to inequity in clinical decision making.[22][23] Approximately 10% of cases are linked to insufficient activity.[24] The risk from alcohol appears to increase at greater than one drink per day.[25] Drinking five glasses of water a day is linked to a decrease in the risk of colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps.[26] *Streptococcus gallolyticus* is associated with colorectal cancer.[27] Some strains of *Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus* complex are consumed by millions of people daily and thus may be safe.[28] 25 to 80% of people with *Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus* bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors.[29] Seroprevalence of *Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus* is considered as a candidate practical marker for the early prediction of an underlying bowel lesion at high risk population.[29] It has been suggested that the presence of antibodies to *Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus* antigens or the antigens themselves in the bloodstream may act as markers for the carcinogenesis in the colon.[29]\n\n\nPathogenic *Escherichia coli* may increase the risk of colorectal cancer by producing the genotoxic metabolite, colibactin.[30]\n\n\n\n### Inflammatory bowel disease[edit]\n\n\nPeople with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are at increased risk of colon cancer.[31][32] The risk increases the longer a person has the disease, and the worse the severity of inflammation.[33] In these high risk groups, both prevention with aspirin and regular colonoscopies are recommended.[34] Endoscopic surveillance in this high-risk population may reduce the development of colorectal cancer through early diagnosis and may also reduce the chances of dying from colon cancer.[34] People with inflammatory bowel disease account for less than 2% of colon cancer cases yearly.[33] In those with Crohn's disease, 2% get colorectal cancer after 10 years, 8% after 20 years, and 18% after 30 years.[33] In people who have ulcerative colitis, approximately 16% develop either a cancer precursor or cancer of the colon over 30 years.[33]\n\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nThose with a family history in two or more first-degree relatives (such as a parent or sibling) have a two to threefold greater risk of disease, and this group accounts for about 20% of all cases. A number of genetic syndromes are also associated with higher rates of colorectal cancer. The most common of these is hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, or Lynch syndrome) which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer.[20] Other syndromes that are strongly associated with colorectal cancer include Gardner syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).[35] For people with these syndromes, cancer almost always occurs and makes up 1% of the cancer cases.[36] A total proctocolectomy may be recommended for people with FAP as a preventive measure due to the high risk of malignancy. Colectomy, removal of the colon, may not suffice as a preventive measure because of the high risk of rectal cancer if the rectum remains.[37] The most common polyposis syndrome affecting the colon is serrated polyposis syndrome,[38] which is associated with a 25-40% risk of CRC.[39]\n\n\nMutations in the pair of genes (POLE and POLD1) have been associated with familial colon cancer.[40]\n\n\nMost deaths due to colon cancer are associated with metastatic disease. A gene that appears to contribute to the potential for metastatic disease, metastasis associated in colon cancer 1 (*MACC1*), has been isolated.[41] It is a transcriptional factor that influences the expression of hepatocyte growth factor. This gene is associated with the proliferation, invasion, and scattering of colon cancer cells in cell culture, and tumor growth and metastasis in mice. MACC1 may be a potential target for cancer intervention, but this possibility needs to be confirmed with clinical studies.[42]\n\n\nEpigenetic factors, such as abnormal DNA methylation of tumor suppressor promoters, play a role in the development of colorectal cancer.[43]\n\n\nAshkenazi Jews have a 6% higher risk rate of getting adenomas and then colon cancer due to mutations in the APC gene being more common.[44]\n\n\n\n## Pathogenesis[edit]\n\n\nColorectal cancer is a disease originating from the epithelial cells lining the colon or rectum of the gastrointestinal tract, most frequently as a result of genetic mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway that increases signaling activity.[45] The Wnt signaling pathway normally plays an important role for normal function of these cells including maintaining this lining. Mutations can be inherited or acquired, and most probably occur in the intestinal crypt stem cell.[46][47][48] The most commonly mutated gene in all colorectal cancer is the *APC* gene, which produces the APC protein.[45] The APC protein prevents the accumulation of β-catenin protein. Without APC, β-catenin accumulates to high levels and translocates (moves) into the nucleus, binds to DNA, and activates the transcription of proto-oncogenes. These genes are normally important for stem cell renewal and differentiation, but when inappropriately expressed at high levels, they can cause cancer.[45] While APC is mutated in most colon cancers, some cancers have increased β-catenin because of mutations in β-catenin (CTNNB1) that block its own breakdown, or have mutations in other genes with function similar to APC such as AXIN1, AXIN2, TCF7L2, or NKD1.[49]\n\n\nBeyond the defects in the Wnt signaling pathway, other mutations must occur for the cell to become cancerous. The p53 protein, produced by the *TP53* gene, normally monitors cell division and induces their programmed death if they have Wnt pathway defects. Eventually, a cell line acquires a mutation in the *TP53* gene and transforms the tissue from a benign epithelial tumor into an invasive epithelial cell cancer. Sometimes the gene encoding p53 is not mutated, but another protective protein named BAX is mutated instead.[49]\n\n\nOther proteins responsible for programmed cell death that are commonly deactivated in colorectal cancers are TGF-β and DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer). TGF-β has a deactivating mutation in at least half of colorectal cancers. Sometimes TGF-β is not deactivated, but a downstream protein named SMAD is deactivated.[49] DCC commonly has a deleted segment of a chromosome in colorectal cancer.[50]\n\n\nApproximately 70% of all human genes are expressed in colorectal cancer, with just over 1% of having increased expression in colorectal cancer compared to other forms of cancer.[51] Some genes are oncogenes: they are overexpressed in colorectal cancer. For example, genes encoding the proteins KRAS, RAF, and PI3K, which normally stimulate the cell to divide in response to growth factors, can acquire mutations that result in over-activation of cell proliferation. The chronological order of mutations is sometimes important. If a previous APC mutation occurred, a primary KRAS mutation often progresses to cancer rather than a self-limiting hyperplastic or borderline lesion.[52] PTEN, a tumor suppressor, normally inhibits PI3K, but can sometimes become mutated and deactivated.[49]\n\n\nComprehensive, genome-scale analysis has revealed that colorectal carcinomas can be categorized into hypermutated and non-hypermutated tumor types.[53] In addition to the oncogenic and inactivating mutations described for the genes above, non-hypermutated samples also contain mutated CTNNB1, FAM123B, SOX9, ATM, and ARID1A. Progressing through a distinct set of genetic events, hypermutated tumors display mutated forms of ACVR2A, TGFBR2, MSH3, MSH6, SLC9A9, TCF7L2, and BRAF. The common theme among these genes, across both tumor types, is their involvement in Wnt and TGF-β signaling pathways, which results in increased activity of MYC, a central player in colorectal cancer.[53]\n\n\nMismatch repair (MMR) deficient tumours are characterized by a relatively high amount of poly-nucleotide tandem repeats.[54] This is caused by a deficiency in MMR proteins – which are typically caused by epigenetic silencing and or inherited mutations (*e.g.*, Lynch syndrome).[55] 15 to 18 percent of colorectal cancer tumours have MMR deficiencies, with 3 percent developing due to Lynch syndrome.[56] The role of the mismatch repair system is to protect the integrity of the genetic material within cells (*i.e.*, error detecting and correcting).[55] Consequently, a deficiency in MMR proteins may lead to an inability to detect and repair genetic damage, allowing for further cancer-causing mutations to occur and colorectal cancer to progress.[55]\n\n\nThe polyp to cancer progression sequence is the classical model of colorectal cancer pathogenesis.[57] In this **adenoma-carcinoma sequence**, [58] normal epithelial cells proress to dysplastic cells such as adenomas, and then to carcinoma, by a process of progressive genetic mutation.[59] Central to the polyp to CRC sequence are gene mutations, epigenetic alterations, and local inflammatory changes.[57] The polyp to CRC sequence can be used as an underlying framework to illustrate how specific molecular changes lead to various cancer subtypes.[57]\n\n\n\n### Field defects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Longitudinally opened freshly resected colon segment showing a cancer and four polyps. Plus a schematic diagram indicating a likely field defect (a region of tissue that precedes and predisposes to the development of cancer) in this colon segment. The diagram indicates sub-clones and sub-sub-clones that were precursors to the tumors.\nThe term \"field cancerization\" was first used in 1953 to describe an area or \"field\" of epithelium that has been preconditioned (by what were largely unknown processes at the time) to predispose it towards development of cancer.[60] Since then, the terms \"field cancerization\", \"field carcinogenesis\", \"field defect\", and \"field effect\" have been used to describe pre-malignant or pre-neoplastic tissue in which new cancers are likely to arise.[61]\n\n\nField defects are important in progression to colon cancer.[62][63]\n\n\nHowever, as pointed out by Rubin, \"The vast majority of studies in cancer research has been done on well-defined tumors *in vivo*, or on discrete neoplastic foci *in vitro*. Yet there is evidence that more than 80% of the somatic mutations found in mutator phenotype human colorectal tumors occur before the onset of terminal clonal expansion.\"[64][65] Similarly, Vogelstein et al.[66] pointed out that more than half of somatic mutations identified in tumors occurred in a pre-neoplastic phase (in a field defect), during growth of apparently normal cells. Likewise, epigenetic alterations present in tumors may have occurred in pre-neoplastic field defects.[67]\n\n\nAn expanded view of field effect has been termed \"etiologic field effect\", which encompasses not only molecular and pathologic changes in pre-neoplastic cells but also influences of exogenous environmental factors and molecular changes in the local microenvironment on neoplastic evolution from tumor initiation to death.[68]\n\n\n\n### Epigenetics[edit]\n\n\nEpigenetic alterations are much more frequent in colon cancer than genetic (mutational) alterations. As described by Vogelstein et al.,[66] an average cancer of the colon has only 1 or 2 oncogene mutations and 1 to 5 tumor suppressor mutations (together designated \"driver mutations\"), with about 60 further \"passenger\" mutations. The oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are well studied and are described above under Pathogenesis.[69][70]\n\n\nIn addition to epigenetic alteration of expression of miRNAs, other common types of epigenetic alterations in cancers that change gene expression levels include direct hypermethylation or hypomethylation of CpG islands of protein-encoding genes and alterations in histones and chromosomal architecture that influence gene expression.[71] As an example, 147 hypermethylations and 27 hypomethylations of protein coding genes were frequently associated with colorectal cancers. Of the hypermethylated genes, 10 were hypermethylated in 100% of colon cancers, and many others were hypermethylated in more than 50% of colon cancers.[72] In addition, 11 hypermethylations and 96 hypomethylations of miRNAs were also associated with colorectal cancers.[72] Abnormal (aberrant) methylation occurs as a normal consequence of normal aging and the risk of colorectal cancer increases as a person gets older.[73] The source and trigger of this age-related methylation is unknown.[73][74] Approximately half of the genes that show age-related methylation changes are the same genes that have been identified to be involved in the development of colorectal cancer.[73] These findings may suggest a reason for age being associated with the increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.[73]\n\n\nEpigenetic reductions of DNA repair enzyme expression may likely lead to the genomic and epigenomic instability characteristic of cancer.[75][76][67] As summarized in the articles Carcinogenesis and Neoplasm, for sporadic cancers in general, a deficiency in DNA repair is occasionally due to a mutation in a DNA repair gene, but is much more frequently due to epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes.[77]\n\n\nEpigenetic alterations involved in the development of colorectal cancer may affect a person's response to chemotherapy.[78]\n\n\n\n### Genomics | Epigenomics[edit]\n\n\nConsensus molecular subtypes (CMS) classification of colorectal cancer was first introduced in 2015. CMS classification so far has been considered the most robust classification system available for CRC that has a clear biological interpretability and the basis for future clinical stratification and subtype-based targeted interventions.[79]\n\n\nA novel Epigenome-based Classification (EpiC) of colorectal cancer was proposed in 2021 introducing 4 enhancer subtypes in people with CRC. Chromatin states using 6 histone marks are characterized to identify EpiC subtypes. A combinatorial therapeutic approach based on the previously introduced consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) and EpiCs could significantly enhance current treatment strategies.[80]\n\n\n\n## Diagnosis[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Colon cancer with extensive metastases to the liver\nColorectal cancer diagnosis is performed by sampling of areas of the colon suspicious for possible tumor development, typically during colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, depending on the location of the lesion.[20] It is confirmed by microscopical examination of a tissue sample.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Medical imaging[edit]\n\n\nA colorectal cancer is sometimes initially discovered on CT scan.[81]\n\n\nPresence of metastases is determined by a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.[20] Other potential imaging tests such as PET and MRI may be used in certain cases.[20] MRI is particularly useful to determine local stage of the tumor and to plan the optimal surgical approach.[81]\n\n\nMRI is also performed after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to identify patients who achieve complete response. Patients with complete response on both MRI and endoscopy may not require surgical resection and can avoid unnecessary surgical morbidity and complications.[82] Patients selected for non-surgical treatment of rectal cancer should have periodic MRI scans, receive physical examinations, and undergo endoscopy procedures to detect any tumor re-growth which can occur in a minority of these patients. When local recurrence occurs, periodic follow up can detect it when it is still small and curable with salvage surgery. In addition, MRI tumor regression grades can be assigned after chemoradiotherapy which correlate with patients' long-term survival outcomes.[83]\n\n\n\n### Histopathology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Relative incidence of various histopathological types of colorectal cancer. The vast majority of colorectal cancers are adenocarcinomas.[84]\n![](image)Micrograph of colorectal adenocarcinoma, showing \"dirty necrosis\".\nFurther information: Histopathology of colorectal adenocarcinoma\n\nThe histopathologic characteristics of the tumor are reported from the analysis of tissue taken from a biopsy or surgery. A pathology report contains a description of the microscopical characteristics of the tumor tissue, including both tumor cells and how the tumor invades into healthy tissues and finally if the tumor appears to be completely removed. The most common form of colon cancer is adenocarcinoma, constituting between 95%[85] and 98%[86] of all cases of colorectal cancer. Other, rarer types include lymphoma, adenosquamous and squamous cell carcinoma. Some subtypes are more aggressive.[87] Immunohistochemistry may be used in uncertain cases.[88]\n\n\n\n### Staging[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colon cancer staging\n\nStaging of the cancer is based on both radiological and pathological findings. As with most other forms of cancer, tumor staging is based on the TNM system which considers how much the initial tumor has spread and the presence of metastases in lymph nodes and more distant organs.[20] The AJCC 8th edition was published in 2018.[89]\n\n\n\n## Prevention[edit]\n\n\nIt has been estimated that about half of colorectal cancer cases are due to lifestyle factors, and about a quarter of all cases are preventable.[90] Increasing surveillance, engaging in physical activity, consuming a diet high in fiber, and reducing smoking and alcohol consumption decrease the risk.[91][92]\n\n\n\n### Lifestyle[edit]\n\n\nLifestyle risk factors with strong evidence include lack of exercise, cigarette smoking, alcohol, and obesity.[93][94][95] The risk of colon cancer can be reduced by maintaining a normal body weight through a combination of sufficient exercise and eating a healthy diet.[96]\n\n\nCurrent research consistently links eating more red meat and processed meat to a higher risk of the disease.[97] Starting in the 1970s, dietary recommendations to prevent colorectal cancer often included increasing the consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and reducing the intake of red meat and processed meats. This was based on animal studies and retrospective observational studies. However, large scale prospective studies have failed to demonstrate a significant protective effect, and due to the multiple causes of cancer and the complexity of studying correlations between diet and health, it is uncertain whether any specific dietary interventions will have significant protective effects.[98]: 432–433[99]: 125–126 In 2018 the National Cancer Institute stated that \"There is no reliable evidence that a diet started in adulthood that is low in fat and meat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables reduces the risk of CRC by a clinically important degree.\"[93][100]\n\n\nAccording to the World Cancer Research Fund, consuming alcohol drinks and consuming processed meat both increase the risk of colorectal cancer.[101]\n\n\nThe 2014 World Health Organization cancer report noted that it has been hypothesized that dietary fiber might help prevent colorectal cancer, but that most studies at the time had not yet studied the correlation.[99] A 2019 review, however, found evidence of benefit from dietary fiber and whole grains.[102] The World Cancer Research Fund listed the benefit of fiber for prevention of colorectal cancer as \"probable\" as of 2017.[103] A 2022 umbrella review says there is \"convincing evidence\" for that association.[104]\n\n\nHigher physical activity is recommended.[21][105] Physical exercise is associated with a modest reduction in colon but not rectal cancer risk.[106][107] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of colon cancer by about 21%.[108] Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from colon cancer. Regular exercise does not negate the risk but does lower it.[109]\n\n\n\n### Medication and supplements[edit]\n\n\nAspirin and celecoxib appear to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer in those at high risk.[110][111] Aspirin is recommended in those who are 50 to 60 years old, do not have an increased risk of bleeding, and are at risk for cardiovascular disease to prevent colorectal cancer.[112] It is not recommended in those at average risk.[113]\n\n\nThere is tentative evidence for calcium supplementation, but it is not sufficient to make a recommendation.[114] Vitamin D intake and blood levels are associated with a lower risk of colon cancer.[115][116]\n\n\n\n### Screening[edit]\n\n\nAs more than 80% of colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps, screening for this cancer is effective for both early detection and for prevention.[20][117] Diagnosis of cases of colorectal cancer through screening tends to occur 2–3 years before diagnosis of cases with symptoms.[20] Any polyps that are detected can be removed, usually by colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, and thus prevent them from turning into cancer. Screening has the potential to reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 60%.[118]\n\n\nThe three main screening tests are colonoscopy, fecal occult blood testing, and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Of the three, only sigmoidoscopy cannot screen the right side of the colon where 42% of cancers are found.[119] Flexible sigmoidoscopy, however, has the best evidence for decreasing the risk of death from any cause.[120]\n\n\nFecal occult blood testing (FOBT) of the stool is typically recommended every two years and can be either guaiac-based or immunochemical.[20] If abnormal FOBT results are found, participants are typically referred for a follow-up colonoscopy examination. When done once every 1–2 years, FOBT screening reduces colorectal cancer deaths by 16% and among those participating in screening, colorectal cancer deaths can be reduced up to 23%, although it has not been proven to reduce all-cause mortality.[121] Immunochemical tests are accurate and do not require dietary or medication changes before testing.[122] However, research in the UK has found that for these immunochemical tests, the threshold for further investigation is set at a point that may miss more than half of bowel cancer cases. The research suggests that the NHS England's Bowel Cancer Screening Programme could make better use of the test's ability to provide the exact concentration of blood in faeces (rather than only whether it is above or below a cutoff level).[123][124]\n\n\nOther options include virtual colonoscopy and stool DNA screening testing (FIT-DNA). Virtual colonoscopy via a CT scan appears as good as standard colonoscopy for detecting cancers and large adenomas but is expensive, associated with radiation exposure, and cannot remove any detected abnormal growths as standard colonoscopy can.[20] Stool DNA screening test looks for biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and precancerous lesions, including altered DNA and blood hemoglobin. A positive result should be followed by colonoscopy. FIT-DNA has more false positives than FIT and thus results in more adverse effects.[10] Further study is required as of 2016 to determine whether a three-year screening interval is correct.[10]\n\n\n\n#### Recommendations[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, screening is typically recommended between ages 50 and 75 years.[10][125] The American Cancer Society recommends starting at the age of 45.[126] For those between 76 and 85 years old, the decision to screen should be individualized.[10] For those at high risk, screenings usually begin at around 40.[20][127]\n\n\nSeveral screening methods are recommended including stool-based tests every 2 years, sigmoidoscopy every 10 years with fecal immunochemical testing every two years, and colonoscopy every 10 years.[125] It is unclear which of these two methods is better.[128] Colonoscopy may find more cancers in the first part of the colon, but is associated with greater cost and more complications.[128] For people with average risk who have had a high-quality colonoscopy with normal results, the American Gastroenterological Association does not recommend any type of screening in the 10 years following the colonoscopy.[129][130] For people over 75 or those with a life expectancy of less than 10 years, screening is not recommended.[131] It takes about 10 years after screening for one out of a 1000 people to benefit.[132] The USPSTF list seven potential strategies for screening, with the most important thing being that at least one of these strategies is appropriately used.[10]\n\n\nIn Canada, among those 50 to 75 years old at normal risk, fecal immunochemical testing or FOBT is recommended every two years or sigmoidoscopy every 10 years.[133] Colonoscopy is less preferred.[133]\n\n\nSome countries have national colorectal screening programs which offer FOBT screening for all adults within a certain age group, typically starting between ages 50 and 60. Examples of countries with organised screening include the United Kingdom,[134] Australia,[135] the Netherlands,[136] Hong Kong, and Taiwan.[137]\n\n\nThe UK Bowel Cancer Screening Programme aims to find warning signs in people aged 60 to 74, by recommending a faecal immunochemical test (FIT) every two years. FIT measures blood in faeces, and people with levels above a certain threshold may have bowel tissue examined for signs of cancer. Growths having cancerous potential are removed.[138][124]\n\n\n\n## Treatment[edit]\n\n\nThe treatment of colorectal cancer can be aimed at cure or palliation. The decision on which aim to adopt depends on various factors, including the person's health and preferences, as well as the stage of the tumor.[139] Assessment in multidisciplinary teams is a critical part of determining whether the patient is suitable for surgery or not.[140] When colorectal cancer is caught early, surgery can be curative. However, when it is detected at later stages (for which metastases are present), this is less likely and treatment is often directed at palliation, to relieve symptoms caused by the tumour and keep the person as comfortable as possible.[20]\n\n\n\n### Surgery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A diagram of a local resection of early stage colon cancer\n![](image)A diagram of local surgery for rectal cancer\nAt an early stage, colorectal cancer may be removed during a colonoscopy using one of several techniques, including endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection.[5] Endoscopic resection is possible if there is low possibility of lymph node metastasis and the size and location of the tumor make en bloc resection possible.[141] For people with localized cancer, the preferred treatment is complete surgical removal with adequate margins, with the attempt of achieving a cure. The procedure of choice is a partial colectomy (or proctocolectomy for rectal lesions) where the affected part of the colon or rectum is removed along with parts of its mesocolon and blood supply to facilitate removal of draining lymph nodes. This can be done either by an open laparotomy or laparoscopically, depending on factors related to the individual person and lesion factors.[20] The colon may then be reconnected or a person may have a colostomy.[5]\n\n\nIf there are only a few metastases in the liver or lungs, these may also be removed. Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the cancer before attempting to remove it. The two most common sites of recurrence of colorectal cancer are the liver and lungs.[20] For peritoneal carcinomatosis cytoreductive surgery, sometimes in combination with HIPEC can be used in an attempt to remove the cancer.[142]\n\n\n\n### Chemotherapy[edit]\n\n\nIn both cancer of the colon and rectum, chemotherapy may be used in addition to surgery in certain cases. The decision to add chemotherapy in management of colon and rectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease.[143]\n\n\nIn Stage I colon cancer, no chemotherapy is offered, and surgery is the definitive treatment. The role of chemotherapy in Stage II colon cancer is debatable, and is usually not offered unless risk factors such as T4 tumor, undifferentiated tumor, vascular and perineural invasion or inadequate lymph node sampling is identified.[144] It is also known that the people who carry abnormalities of the mismatch repair genes do not benefit from chemotherapy. For stage III and Stage IV colon cancer, chemotherapy is an integral part of treatment.[20]\n\n\nIf cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs, which is the case with stage III and stage IV colon cancer respectively, adding chemotherapy agents fluorouracil, capecitabine or oxaliplatin increases life expectancy. If the lymph nodes do not contain cancer, the benefits of chemotherapy are controversial. If the cancer is widely metastatic or unresectable, treatment is then palliative. Typically in this setting, a number of different chemotherapy medications may be used.[20] Chemotherapy drugs for this condition may include capecitabine, fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and UFT.[145] The drugs capecitabine and fluorouracil are interchangeable, with capecitabine being an oral medication and fluorouracil being an intravenous medicine. Some specific regimens used for CRC are CAPOX, FOLFOX, FOLFOXIRI, and FOLFIRI.[146] Antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab are often added in first line therapy.[*citation needed*] Another class of drugs used in the second line setting are epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, of which the three FDA approved ones are aflibercept, cetuximab and panitumumab.[147][148]\n\n\nThe primary difference in the approach to low stage rectal cancer is the incorporation of radiation therapy. Often, it is used in conjunction with chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant fashion to enable surgical resection, so that ultimately a colostomy is not required. However, it may not be possible in low lying tumors, in which case, a permanent colostomy may be required. Stage IV rectal cancer is treated similar to stage IV colon cancer.\n\n\nStage IV colorectal cancer due to peritoneal carcinomatosis can be treated using HIPEC combined with cytoreductive surgery, in some people.[149][150][151] Also, T4 colorectal cancer can be treated with HIPEC to avoid future relapses.[152]\n\n\n\n### Radiation therapy[edit]\n\n\nWhile a combination of radiation and chemotherapy may be useful for rectal cancer,[20] for some people requiring treatment, chemoradiotherapy can increase acute treatment-related toxicity, and has not been shown to improve survival rates compared to radiotherapy alone, although it is associated with less local recurrence.[142] The use of radiotherapy in colon cancer is not routine due to the sensitivity of the bowels to radiation.[153] As with chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used as a neoadjuvant for clinical stages T3 and T4 for rectal cancer.[154] This results in downsizing or downstaging of the tumour, preparing it for surgical resection, and also decreases local recurrence rates.[154] For locally advanced rectal cancer, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment.[155] Additionally, when surgery is not possible radiation therapy has been suggested to be an effective treatment against CRC pulmonary metastases, which are developed by 10-15% of people with CRC.[156]\n\n\n\n### Immunotherapy[edit]\n\n\nImmunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has been found to be useful for a type of colorectal cancer with mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability.[157][158] Pembrolizumab is approved for advanced CRC tumours that are MMR deficient and have failed usual treatments.[159] Most people who do improve, however, still worsen after months or years.[158]\n\n\nOn the other hand, in a prospective phase 2 study published in June 2022 in The New England Journal of Medicine, 12 patients with Deficient Mismatch Repair (dMMR) stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma were administered single-agent dostarlimab, an anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody, every three weeks for six months. After a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 6 to 25 months), all 12 patients had a complete clinical response with no evidence of tumor on MRI, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron-emission tomography, endoscopic evaluation, digital rectal examination, or biopsy. Moreover, no patient in the trial needed chemoradiotherapy or surgery, and no patient reported adverse events of grade 3 or higher. However, although the results of this study are promising, the study is small and has uncertainties about long-term outcomes.[160]\n\n\n\n### Palliative care[edit]\n\n\nPalliative care is recommended for any person who has advanced colon cancer or who has significant symptoms.[161][162]\n\n\nInvolvement of palliative care may be beneficial to improve the quality of life for both the person and his or her family, by improving symptoms, anxiety and preventing admissions to the hospital.[163]\n\n\nIn people with incurable colorectal cancer, palliative care can consist of procedures that relieve symptoms or complications from the cancer but do not attempt to cure the underlying cancer, thereby improving quality of life. Surgical options may include non-curative surgical removal of some of the cancer tissue, bypassing part of the intestines, or stent placement. These procedures can be considered to improve symptoms and reduce complications such as bleeding from the tumor, abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction.[164] Non-operative methods of symptomatic treatment include radiation therapy to decrease tumor size as well as pain medications.[165]\n\n\n\n### Follow-up[edit]\n\n\nThe U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Society of Clinical Oncology provide guidelines for the follow-up of colon cancer.[166][167] A medical history and physical examination are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 5 years. Carcinoembryonic antigen blood level measurements follow the same timing, but are only advised for people with T2 or greater lesions who are candidates for intervention. A CT-scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can be considered annually for the first 3 years for people who are at high risk of recurrence (for example, those who had poorly differentiated tumors or venous or lymphatic invasion) and are candidates for curative surgery (with the aim to cure). A colonoscopy can be done after 1 year, except if it could not be done during the initial staging because of an obstructing mass, in which case it should be performed after 3 to 6 months. If a villous polyp, a polyp >1 centimeter or high-grade dysplasia is found, it can be repeated after 3 years, then every 5 years. For other abnormalities, the colonoscopy can be repeated after 1 year.[143]\n\n\nRoutine PET or ultrasound scanning, chest X-rays, complete blood count or liver function tests are not recommended.[166][167]\n\n\nFor people who have undergone curative surgery or adjuvant therapy (or both) to treat non-metastatic colorectal cancer, intense surveillance and close follow-up have not been shown to provide additional survival benefits.[168]\n\n\n\n### Exercise[edit]\n\n\nExercise may be recommended in the future as secondary therapy to cancer survivors. In epidemiological studies, exercise may decrease colorectal cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. Results for the specific amounts of exercise needed to observe a benefit were conflicting. These differences may reflect differences in tumour biology and the expression of biomarkers. People with tumors that lacked CTNNB1 expression (β-catenin), involved in Wnt signalling pathway, required more than 18 Metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week, a measure of exercise, to observe a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. The mechanism of how exercise benefits survival may be involved in immune surveillance and inflammation pathways. In clinical studies, a pro-inflammatory response was found in people with stage II-III colorectal cancer who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after completing their primary therapy. Oxidative balance may be another possible mechanism for benefits observed. A significant decrease in 8-oxo-dG was found in the urine of people who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after primary therapy. Other possible mechanisms may involve metabolic hormone and sex-steroid hormones, although these pathways may be involved in other types of cancers.[169][170]\n\n\nAnother potential biomarker may be p27. Survivors with tumors that expressed p27 and performed greater and equal to 18 MET hours per week were found to have reduced colorectal cancer mortality survival compared to those with less than 18 MET hours per week. Survivors without p27 expression who exercised were shown to have worse outcomes. The constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway may explain the loss of p27 and excess energy balance may up-regulate p27 to stop cancer cells from dividing.[170]\n\n\nPhysical activity provides benefits to people with non-advanced colorectal cancer. Improvements in aerobic fitness, cancer-related fatigue and health-related quality of life have been reported in the short term.[171] However, these improvements were not observed at the level of disease-related mental health, such as anxiety and depression.[171]\n\n\n\n## Prognosis[edit]\n\n\nFewer than 600 genes are linked to outcomes in colorectal cancer.[51] These include both unfavorable genes, where high expression is related to poor outcome, for example the heat shock 70 kDa protein 1 (HSPA1A), and favorable genes where high expression is associated with better survival, for example the putative RNA-binding protein 3 (RBM3).[51] The prognosis is also correlated with a poor fidelity of the pre-mRNA splicing apparatus, and thus a high number of deviating alternative splicing.[172]\n\n\n\n### Recurrence rates[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cancer recurrence § Rectal cancer\n\nThe average five-year recurrence rate in people where surgery is successful is 5% for stage I cancers, 12% in stage II and 33% in stage III. However, depending on the number of risk factors it ranges from 9–22% in stage II and 17–44% in stage III.[173]\n\n\n\n### Survival rates[edit]\n\n\nIn Europe the five-year survival rate for colorectal cancer is less than 60%. In the developed world about a third of people who get the disease die from it.[20]\n\n\nSurvival is directly related to detection and the type of cancer involved, but overall is poor for symptomatic cancers, as they are typically quite advanced. Survival rates for early stage detection are about five times that of late stage cancers. People with a tumor that has not breached the muscularis mucosa (TNM stage Tis, N0, M0) have a five-year survival rate of 100%, while those with invasive cancer of T1 (within the submucosal layer) or T2 (within the muscular layer) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 90%. Those with a more invasive tumor yet without node involvement (T3-4, N0, M0) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 70%. People with positive regional lymph nodes (any T, N1-3, M0) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 40%, while those with distant metastases (any T, any N, M1) have a poor prognosis and the five year survival ranges from <5 percent to 31 percent.[174][175][176][177][178] The prognosis depends on a multitude of factors which include the physical fitness level of the person, extent of metastases, and tumor grade.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWhilst the impact of colorectal cancer on those who survive varies greatly there will often be a need to adapt to both physical and psychological outcomes of the illness and its treatment.[179] For example, it is common for people to experience incontinence,[180] sexual dysfunction,[181] problems with stoma care[182] and fear of cancer recurrence[183] after primary treatment has concluded.\n\n\nA qualitative systematic review published in 2021 highlighted that there are three main factors influencing adaptation to living with and beyond colorectal cancer: support mechanisms, severity of late effects of treatment and psychosocial adjustment. Therefore, it is essential that people are offered appropriate support to help them better adapt to life following treatment.[184]\n\n\n\n## Epidemiology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Colon and rectum cancer deaths per million persons in 2012 3–17\n18–21\n22–27\n28–36\n37–54\n55–77\n78–162\n163–244\n245–329\n330–533\n\nGlobally more than 1 million people get colorectal cancer every year[20] resulting in about 715,000 deaths as of 2010 up from 490,000 in 1990.[185]\n\n\nAs of 2012[update], it is the second most common cause of cancer in women (9.2% of diagnoses) and the third most common in men (10.0%)[14]: 16 with it being the fourth most common cause of cancer death after lung, stomach, and liver cancer.[186] It is more common in developed than developing countries.[187] Global incidence varies 10-fold, with highest rates in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the US and lowest rates in Africa and South-Central Asia.[188]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, the incidence of colorectal cancer in the United States was anticipated to be about 151,000 adults, including over 106,000 new cases of colon cancer (some 54,000 men and 52,000 women) and about 45,000 new cases of rectal cancer.[189] Since the 1980s, the incidence of colorectal cancer decreased, dropping by about 2% annually from 2014 to 2018 in adults aged 50 and older, due mainly to improved screening.[189] However, incidence of colorectal cancer has increased in individuals aged 25 to 50. In early 2023, the American Cancer Society (ACS) reported that 20% of diagnoses (of colon cancer) in 2019 were in patients under age 55, which is about double the rate in 1995, and rates of advanced disease increased by about 3% annually in people younger than 50. It predicted that, in 2023, an estimated 19,550 diagnoses and 3,750 deaths would be in people younger than 50.[190] Colorectal cancer also disproportionately affects the Black community, where the rates are the highest of any racial/ethnic group in the US. African Americans are about 20% more likely to get colorectal cancer and about 40% more likely to die from it than most other groups. Black Americans often experience greater obstacles to cancer prevention, detection, treatment, and survival, including systemic racial disparities that are complex and go beyond the obvious connection to cancer.\n\n\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\nIn the UK about 41,000 people a year get colon cancer making it the fourth most common type.[191]\n\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\nOne in 19 men and one in 28 women in Australia will develop colorectal cancer before the age of 75; one in 10 men and one in 15 women will develop it by 85 years of age.[192]\n\n\n\n### Papua New Guinea[edit]\n\n\nIn the developing countries like Papua New Guinea and other Pacific Island States including the Solomon Islands, colorectal cancer is a very rare cancer amongst the people, which is least common compared to lung, stomach, liver or breast cancer. It is estimated that at least 8 in 100,000 of the people are most likely to developed colorectal cancer every year, which is unlike lung or breast cancer, where for the latter alone is 24 in 100,000 of the women folks alone.[193]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nRectal cancer has been diagnosed in an Ancient Egyptian mummy who had lived in the Dakhleh Oasis during the Ptolemaic period.[194]\n\n\n\n## Society and culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people diagnosed with colorectal cancer\n\nIn the United States, March is colorectal cancer awareness month.[118]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nPreliminary in-vitro evidence suggests lactic acid bacteria (e.g., lactobacilli, streptococci or lactococci) may be protective against the development and progression of colorectal cancer through several mechanisms such as antioxidant activity, immunomodulation, promoting programmed cell death, antiproliferative effects, and epigenetic modification of cancer cells.[195]\n\n\nMouse models of colorectal and intestinal cancer have been developed and are used in research.[196][197][198]\n\n\n\n* The Cancer Genome Atlas[53]\n* The Colorectal Cancer Atlas integrating genomic and proteomic data pertaining to colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines have been developed.[199]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Fecal occult blood\n* Adenoma-carcinoma sequence\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"General Information About Colon Cancer\". *NCI*.

Several large prospective cohort studies of dietary fibre and colon cancer risk have not supported an association, although an inverse relation was seen in the large European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study and a recent meta-analysis. The variation in findings from prospective studies needs to be better understood; dietary fibre is complex and heterogeneous, and the relation with colorectal cancer could differ by dietary source.

Also, moderate pain during sexual intercourse and vaginal discharge are symptoms of cervical cancer.[27] In advanced disease, metastases may be present in the abdomen, lungs, or elsewhere.[28]\n\n\nSymptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include: loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, pelvic pain, back pain, leg pain, swollen legs, heavy vaginal bleeding, bone fractures, and (rarely) leakage of urine or feces from the vagina.[29] Bleeding after douching or after a pelvic exam is a common symptom of cervical cancer.[30]\n\n\n\n## Causes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In most cases, cells infected with the HPV heal on their own. In some cases, however, the virus continues to spread and becomes an invasive cancer.\n![](image)Cervix in relation to upper part of vagina and posterior portion of uterus, showing difference in covering epithelium of inner structures\nInfection with some types of HPV is the greatest risk factor for cervical cancer, followed by smoking.[31] HIV infection is also a risk factor.[31] Not all of the causes of cervical cancer are known, however, and several other contributing factors have been implicated.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Human papillomavirus[edit]\n\n\nHPV types 16 and 18 are the cause of 75% of cervical cancer cases globally, while 31 and 45 are the causes of another 10%.[34]\n\n\nWomen who have multiple sexual partners, or have partners who have multiple sexual partners, regardless of sex are at higher risk of cervical cancer .[35][36]\n\n\nOf the 150-200 types of HPV known,[37][38] 15 are classified as high-risk types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73, and 82), three as probable high-risk (26, 53, and 66), and 12 as low-risk (6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81, and CP6108).[39]\n\n\nGenital warts, which are a form of benign tumor of epithelial cells, are also caused by various strains of HPV. However, these serotypes are usually not related to cervical cancer. Having multiple strains at the same time is common, including those that can cause cervical cancer along with those that cause warts. Infection with HPV is generally believed to be required for cervical cancer to occur.[40]\n\n\n\n### Smoking[edit]\n\n\nCigarette smoking, both active and passive, increases the risk of cervical cancer. Among HPV-infected women, current and former smokers have roughly two to three times the incidence of invasive cancer. Passive smoking is also associated with increased risk, but to a lesser extent.[41]\n\n\nSmoking has also been linked to the development of cervical cancer.[42][43][31] Smoking can increase the risk in women a few different ways, which can be by direct and indirect methods of inducing cervical cancer.[42][31][44] A direct way of contracting this cancer is a smoker has a higher chance of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) occurring, which has the potential of forming cervical cancer.[42] When CIN3 lesions lead to cancer, most of them have the assistance of the HPV virus, but that is not always the case, which is why it can be considered a direct link to cervical cancer.[44] Heavy smoking and long-term smoking seem to have more of a risk of getting the CIN3 lesions than lighter smoking or not smoking at all.[45] Although smoking has been linked to cervical cancer, it aids in the development of HPV, which is the leading cause of this type of cancer.[31] Also, not only does it aid in the development of HPV, but also if the woman is already HPV-positive, she is at an even greater likelihood of contracting cervical cancer.[45]\n\n\n\n### Oral contraceptives[edit]\n\n\nLong-term use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risk of cervical cancer in women who have had HPV. Women who have used oral contraceptives for 5 to 9 years have about three times the incidence of invasive cancer, and those who used them for 10 years or longer have about four times the risk.[41][46]\n\n\n\n### Multiple pregnancies[edit]\n\n\nHaving many pregnancies is associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer. Among HPV-infected women, those who have had seven or more full-term pregnancies have around four times the risk of cancer compared with women with no pregnancies, and two to three times the risk of women who have had one or two full-term pregnancies.[41]\n\n\n\n## Diagnosis[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cervical cancer seen on a T2-weighted sagittal MR image of the pelvis\n### Biopsy[edit]\n\n\nThe Pap test can be used as a screening test, but produces a false negative in up to 50% of cases of cervical cancer.[47][48] Other concerns is the cost of doing Pap tests, which make them unaffordable in many areas of the world.[49]\n\n\nConfirmation of the diagnosis of cervical cancer or precancer requires a biopsy of the cervix. This is often done through colposcopy, a magnified visual inspection of the cervix aided by using a dilute acetic acid (e.g. vinegar) solution to highlight abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix,[5] with visual contrast provided by staining the normal tissues a mahogany brown with Lugol's iodine.[50] Medical devices used for biopsy of the cervix include punch forceps. Colposcopic impression, the estimate of disease severity based on the visual inspection, forms part of the diagnosis. Further diagnostic and treatment procedures are loop electrical excision procedure and cervical conization, in which the inner lining of the cervix is removed to be examined pathologically. These are carried out if the biopsy confirms severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.[51][52]\n\n\n\n![](image)This large squamous carcinoma (bottom of picture) has obliterated the cervix and invaded the lower uterine segment. The uterus also has a round leiomyoma up higher.\nOften before the biopsy, the doctor asks for medical imaging to rule out other causes of woman's symptoms. Imaging modalities such as ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI have been used to look for alternating disease, spread of the tumor, and effect on adjacent structures. Typically, they appear as heterogeneous mass on the cervix.[53]\n\n\nInterventions such as playing music during the procedure and viewing the procedure on a monitor can reduce the anxiety associated with the examination.[54]\n\n\n\n### Precancerous lesions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Histopathologic image (H&E stain) of carcinoma *in situ* (also called CIN3), stage 0: The normal architecture of stratified squamous epithelium is replaced by irregular cells that extend throughout its full thickness. Normal columnar epithelium is also seen.\nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) means the development of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. It is caused by an HPV infection but in most cases it is resolved by the immune system. However a small percentage of people might develop a more serious CIN which, if left untreated, can develop into cervical cancer.[55][56] CIN is often diagnosed during routine Pap smear examination or colposcopy.[56]\n\n\nThe naming and histologic classification of cervical carcinoma precursor lesions has changed many times over the 20th century. The World Health Organization classification system was descriptive of the lesions, naming them mild, moderate, or severe dysplasia or carcinoma *in situ* (CIS).[57][58] The term cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was developed to place emphasis on the spectrum of abnormality in these lesions, and to help standardize treatment.[58] For premalignant dysplastic changes, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grading (CIN 1-3) is used. It classifies mild dysplasia as CIN1, moderate dysplasia as CIN2, and severe dysplasia and CIS as CIN3.[59] More recently, CIN2 and CIN3 have been combined into CIN2/3. These results are what a pathologist might report from a biopsy.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThese should not be confused with the Bethesda system terms for Pap test (cytopathology) results. Among the Bethesda results: Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). An LSIL Pap may correspond to CIN1, and HSIL may correspond to CIN2 and CIN3,[58] but they are results of different tests, and the Pap test results need not match the histologic findings.[*medical citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cancer subtypes[edit]\n\n\nHistologic subtypes of invasive cervical carcinoma include:[60][61]\n\n\n\n* Squamous cell carcinoma (about 80–85%[62][63])\n* adenocarcinoma (about 15% of cervical cancers in the UK[57])\n* Adenosquamous carcinoma\n* Small cell carcinoma\n* Neuroendocrine tumour\n* Glassy cell carcinoma\n* Villoglandular adenocarcinoma\n\n\n* ![Invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix is characterized by infiltration as irregular anastomosing nests or single cells.[64] This case is poorly differentiated.

Gastric-type mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cervix is a rare type of cancer with aggressive behavior. This type of malignancy is not related to high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV).[65]\nNoncarcinoma malignancies which can rarely occur in the cervix include melanoma and lymphoma. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage does not incorporate lymph node involvement in contrast to the TNM staging for most other cancers. For cases treated surgically, information obtained from the pathologist can be used in assigning a separate pathologic stage, but is not to replace the original clinical stage.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Staging[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cervical cancer staging\n\nCervical cancer is staged by the FIGO system, which is based on clinical examination rather than surgical findings. Prior to the 2018 revisions to FIGO staging, the system allowed only these diagnostic tests to be used in determining the stage: palpation, inspection, colposcopy, endocervical curettage, hysteroscopy, cystoscopy, proctoscopy, intravenous urography, and X-ray examination of the lungs and skeleton, and cervical conization. However, the current system allows use of any imaging or pathological methods for staging.[66]\n\n\n\n* ![Stage 1A cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 1A cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 1B cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 1B cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 2A cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 2A cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 2B cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 2B cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 3B cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 3B cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 4A cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 4A cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 4B cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 4B cervical cancer\n\n\n## Prevention [edit]\n\n\n### Screening[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cervical screening test vehicle in Taiwan\n![](image)Negative visual inspection with acetic acid of the cervix\n![](image)Positive visual inspection with acetic acid of the cervix for CIN-1\nMain articles: Cervical screening and Pap test\n\nChecking cervical cells with the Papanicolaou test (Pap test) for cervical pre-cancer has dramatically reduced the number of cases of, and mortality from, cervical cancer.[24] Liquid-based cytology may reduce the number of inadequate samples.[67][68][69] Pap test screening every three to five years with appropriate follow-up can reduce cervical cancer incidence up to 80%.[70]\n\n\nPap test screening can reveal abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) that in a small percentage can develop into cervical cancer. These precancerous changes can be confirmed with further examination known as colposcopy.\n\n\nPersonal invitations encouraging women to get screened are effective at increasing the likelihood they will do so. Educational materials also help increase the likelihood women will go for screening, but they are not as effective as invitations.[71]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 European guidelines, the age at which to start screening ranges between 20 and 30 years of age, but preferentially not before age 25 or 30 years, and depends on burden of the disease in the population and the available resources.[70]\n\n\nIn the United States, screening is recommended to begin at age 21, regardless of age at which a woman began having sex or other risk factors.[72] Pap tests should be done every three years between the ages of 21 and 65.[72] In women over the age of 65, screening may be discontinued if no abnormal screening results were seen within the previous 10 years and no history of CIN2 or higher exists.[72][73][74] HPV vaccination status does not change screening rates.[73]\n\n\nA number of recommended options exist for screening those 30 to 65.[75] This includes cervical cytology every 3 years, HPV testing every 5 years, or HPV testing together with cytology every 5 years.[75][73] Screening is not beneficial before age 25, as the rate of disease is low. Screening is not beneficial in women older than 60 years if they have a history of negative results.[41] The American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline has recommend for different levels of resource availability.[76]\n\n\nPap tests have not been as effective in developing countries.[77] This is in part because many of these countries have an impoverished health care infrastructure, too few trained and skilled professionals to obtain and interpret Pap tests, uninformed women who get lost to follow-up, and a lengthy turn-around time to get results.[77] Visual inspection with acetic acid and HPV DNA testing have been tried, though with mixed success.[77]\n\n\n\n### Barrier protection[edit]\n\n\nBarrier protection or spermicidal gel use during sexual intercourse decreases, but does not eliminate risk of transmitting the infection,[41] though condoms may protect against genital warts.[78] They also provide protection against other sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and *Chlamydia*, which are associated with greater risks of developing cervical cancer.[*medical citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Vaccination[edit]\n\n\nThree HPV vaccines (Gardasil, Gardasil 9, and Cervarix) reduce the risk of cancerous or precancerous changes of the cervix and perineum by about 93% and 62%, respectively.[79] The vaccines are between 92% and 100% effective against HPV 16 and 18 up to at least 8 years.[41]\n\n\nHPV vaccines are typically given to age 9 to 26, as the vaccine is most effective if given before infection occurs. The duration of effectiveness and whether a booster will be needed is unknown. The high cost of this vaccine has been a cause for concern. Several countries have considered (or are considering) programs to fund HPV vaccination. The American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline has recommendations for different levels of resource availability.[76]\n\n\nSince 2010, young women in Japan have been eligible to receive the cervical cancer vaccination for free.[80] In June 2013, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare mandated that, before administering the vaccine, medical institutions must inform women that the ministry does not recommend it.[80] However, the vaccine is still available at no cost to Japanese women who choose to accept the vaccination.[80]\n\n\n\n### Nutrition[edit]\n\n\nVitamin A is associated with a lower risk[81] as are vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-Carotene.[82]\n\n\n\n## Treatment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cervical cryotherapy\nThe treatment of cervical cancer varies worldwide, largely due to access to surgeons skilled in radical pelvic surgery, and the emergence of fertility-sparing therapy in developed nations. Less advanced stages of cervical cancer typically have treatment options that allow fertility to be maintained, if the patient desires.[83]\n\n\nBecause cervical cancers are radiosensitive, radiation may be used in all stages where surgical options do not exist. Surgical intervention may have better outcomes than radiological approaches.[84] In addition, chemotherapy can be used to treat cervical cancer, and has been found to be more effective than radiation alone.[85] Chemoradiotherapy may increase overall survival and reduce the risk of disease recurrence compared to radiotherapy alone.[86]\n\n\nPrecancerous cells (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) that would lead to cancer and early-stage cervical cancer (IA1) can be treated effectively by various surgical techniques. Surgical treatment methods include excision, where a cone-shaped portion of the cervix is removed, and ablation which removes only the parts with abnormal tissues. While these effectively reduce the risk of the cancer developing or spreading, they cause an increased risk of premature birth in future pregnancies. Surgical techniques that remove more cervical tissue come with less risk of the cancer recurring but a higher chance of giving birth prematurely. Due to this risk, taking into account the age, childbearing plans of the woman, the size and location of the cancer cells are crucial for choosing the right procedure.[51][52] There is low-certainty evidence that peri-operative care approaches, such as 'fast-track surgery' or 'enhanced recovery programmes' may lower surgical stress and improve recovery after gynaecological cancer surgery.[87]\n\n\nMicroinvasive cancer (stage IA) may also be treated by hysterectomy (removal of the whole uterus including part of the vagina).[88] For stage IA2, the lymph nodes are removed as well. Alternatives include local surgical procedures such as a loop electrical excision procedure or cone biopsy.[89][90] A systematic review concluded that more evidence is needed to inform decisions about different surgical techniques for women with cervical cancer at stage IA2.[91]\n\n\nIf a cone biopsy does not produce clear margins[92] (findings on biopsy showing that the tumor is surrounded by cancer free tissue, suggesting all of the tumor is removed), one more possible treatment option for women who want to preserve their fertility is a trachelectomy.[93] This attempts to surgically remove the cancer while preserving the ovaries and uterus, providing for a more conservative operation than a hysterectomy. It is a viable option for those in stage I cervical cancer which has not spread; however, it is not yet considered a standard of care,[94] as few doctors are skilled in this procedure. Even the most experienced surgeon cannot promise that a trachelectomy can be performed until after surgical microscopic examination, as the extent of the spread of cancer is unknown. If the surgeon is not able to microscopically confirm clear margins of cervical tissue once the woman is under general anesthesia in the operating room, a hysterectomy may still be needed. This can only be done during the same operation if the woman has given prior consent. Due to the possible risk of cancer spread to the lymph nodes in stage 1B cancers and some stage 1A cancers, the surgeon may also need to remove some lymph nodes from around the uterus for pathologic evaluation.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA radical trachelectomy can be performed abdominally[95] or vaginally[96] and opinions are conflicting as to which is better.[97] A radical abdominal trachelectomy with lymphadenectomy usually only requires a two- to three-day hospital stay, and most women recover very quickly (about six weeks). Complications are uncommon, although women who are able to conceive after surgery are susceptible to preterm labor and possible late miscarriage.[98] A wait of at least one year is generally recommended before attempting to become pregnant after surgery.[99] Recurrence in the residual cervix is very rare if the cancer has been cleared with the trachelectomy.[94] Yet, women are recommended to practice vigilant prevention and follow-up care including Pap screenings/colposcopy, with biopsies of the remaining lower uterine segment as needed (every 3–4 months for at least 5 years) to monitor for any recurrence in addition to minimizing any new exposures to HPV through safe sex practices until one is actively trying to conceive.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nEarly stages (IB1 and IIA less than 4 cm) can be treated with radical hysterectomy with removal of the lymph nodes or radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is given as external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis and brachytherapy (internal radiation). Women treated with surgery who have high-risk features found on pathologic examination are given radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy to reduce the risk of relapse.[*citation needed*] A Cochrane review has found moderate-certainty evidence that radiation decreases the risk of disease progression in people with stage IB cervical cancer, when compared to no further treatment.[100] However, little evidence was found on its effects on overall survival.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)Brachytherapy for cervical cancer\nLarger early-stage tumors (IB2 and IIA more than 4 cm) may be treated with radiation therapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy, hysterectomy (which then usually requires adjuvant radiation therapy), or cisplatin chemotherapy followed by hysterectomy. When cisplatin is present, it is thought to be the most active single agent in periodic diseases.[101] Such addition of platinum-based chemotherapy to chemoradiation seems not only to improve survival but also reduces risk of recurrence in women with early stage cervical cancer (IA2–IIA).[102] A Cochrane review found a lack of evidence on the benefits and harms of primary hysterectomy compared to primary chemoradiotherapy for cervical cancer in stage IB2.[103]\n\n\nAdvanced-stage tumors (IIB-IVA) are treated with radiation therapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. On 15 June 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of a combination of two chemotherapy drugs, hycamtin and cisplatin, for women with late-stage (IVB) cervical cancer treatment.[104] Combination treatment has significant risk of neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia side effects.[105]\n\n\nThere is insufficient evidence whether anticancer drugs after standard care help women with locally advanced cervical cancer to live longer.[106]\n\n\nFor surgery to be curative, the entire cancer must be removed with no cancer found at the margins of the removed tissue on examination under a microscope.[107] This procedure is known as exenteration.[107]\n\n\nNo evidence is available to suggest that any form of follow‐up approach is better or worse in terms of prolonging survival, improving quality of life or guiding the management of problems that can arise because of the treatment and that in the case of radiotherapy treatment worsen with time.[108] A 2019 review found no controlled trials regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for vaginal bleeding in women with advanced cervical cancer.[109]\n\n\nTisotumab vedotin (Tivdak) was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2021.[110][111]\n\n\n\n* ![Diagram showing the area removed with a posterior surgery](image)\n\nDiagram showing the area removed with a posterior surgery\n* ![Diagram showing the area removed with a total operation](image)\n\nDiagram showing the area removed with a total operation\n* ![Diagram showing the area removed with an anterior operation](image)\n\nDiagram showing the area removed with an anterior operation\n\n\n## Prognosis[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

For intraepithelial cervical neoplasmas the prognosis is good.[112] With treatment, the five-year relative survival rate for the earliest stage of invasive cervical cancer is 92%, and the overall (all stages combined) five-year survival rate is about 66%. These statistics may be improved when applied to women newly diagnosed, bearing in mind that these outcomes may be partly based on the state of treatment five years ago when the women studied were first diagnosed.[113]\n\n\nWith treatment, 80–90% of women with stage I cancer and 60–75% of those with stage II cancer are alive 5 years after diagnosis. Survival rates decrease to 58% for women with stage III cancer and 17% or fewer of those with stage IV cancer five years after diagnosis.[113] Recurrent cervical cancer detected at its earliest stages might be successfully treated with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or a combination of the three. About 35% of women with invasive cervical cancer have persistent or recurrent disease after treatment.[114]\n\n\n\n### By country[edit]\n\n\nFive-year survival in the United States for White women is 69% and for Black women is 57%.[*needs update*][115]\n\n\nRegular screening has meant that precancerous changes and early-stage cervical cancers have been detected and treated early. Figures suggest that cervical screening is saving 5,000 lives each year in the UK by preventing cervical cancer.[116]\nAbout 1,000 women per year die of cervical cancer in the UK. All of the Nordic countries have cervical cancer-screening programs in place.[117] The Pap test was integrated into clinical practice in the Nordic countries in the 1960s.[117]\n\n\nIn Africa outcomes are often worse as diagnosis is frequently at a latter stage of disease.[118] In a scoping review of publicly-available cervical cancer prevention and control plans from African countries, plans tended to emphasize survivorship rather than early HPV diagnosis and prevention.[119]\n\n\n\n## Epidemiology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Age-standardized death from cervical cancer per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004[120] |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| no data\n <2.4\n 2.4–4.8\n 4.8–7.2\n 7.2–9.6\n 9.6–12\n 12–14.4\n | 14.4–16.8\n 16.8–19.2\n 19.2–21.6\n 21.6–24\n 24–26.4\n >26.4\n |\n\nWorldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and deaths from cancer in women.[3] In 2018, 570,000 cases of cervical cancer were estimated to have occurred, with over 300,000 deaths.[121] It is the second-most common cause of female-specific cancer after breast cancer, accounting for around 8% of both total cancer cases and total cancer deaths in women.[21] About 80% of cervical cancers occur in developing countries.[122] It is the most frequently detected cancer during pregnancy, with an occurrence of 1.5 to 12 for every 100,000 pregnancies.[123]\n\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(September 2021)*\n |\n\n\nIn 2022, it is estimated that 942 new cases of cervical cancer will be diagnosed in Australia. In 2022, it is estimated that a female has a 1 in 180 (or 0.56%) risk of being diagnosed with cervical cancer by the age of 85.[124]\n\n\nIn 2020, there were 165 women aged 25–74 who died from cervical cancer, which is a mortality rate of 2 deaths per 100,000 women in the population. Over the 5 years 2016–2020, there were 62 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women aged 25–74 who died from cervical cancer, which is a mortality rate of 7 deaths per 100,000 Indigenous women in the population. Over the 5 years 2016–2020, the age-standardised mortality rate among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women was 3.8 times the rate of non-Indigenous Australians.[125]\n\n\nThe number of women diagnosed with cervical cancer has dropped on average by 4.5% each year since organised screening began in 1991 (1991–2005).[126] Regular twice-yearly Pap tests can reduce the incidence of cervical cancer up to 90% in Australia, and save 1,200 Australian women from dying from the disease each year.[127] It is predicted that because of the success of the primary HPV testing programme there will be fewer than four new cases per 100 000 women annually by 2028.[128]\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nAn estimated 1,450 Canadians will be diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2022. An estimated 380 will die from it.[129]\n\n\n\n### India[edit]\n\n\nIn India, the number of people with cervical cancer is rising, but overall the age-adjusted rates are decreasing.[130] Usage of condoms in the female population has improved the survival of women with cancers of the cervix.[131]\n\n\n\n### European Union[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2022, the World Health Organization announced that \"each year in the WHO European Region more than 66 000 women are newly diagnosed with cervical cancer and more than 30 000 die from this preventable disease.\"[132]\n\n\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(September 2021)*\n |\n\n\nCervical cancer is the 12th-most common cancer in women in the UK (around 3,100 women were diagnosed with the disease in 2011), and accounts for 1% of cancer deaths (around 920 died in 2012).[133] With a 42% reduction from 1988 to 1997, the NHS-implemented screening programme has been highly successful, screening the highest-risk age group (25–49 years) every 3 years, and those ages 50–64 every 5 years.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(September 2021)*\n |\n\n\nAn estimated 13,170 new cervical cancers and 4,250 cervical cancer deaths will occur in the United States in 2019.[134] The median age at diagnosis is 50. The rates of new cases in the United States was 7.3 per 100,000 women, based on rates from 2012 to 2016. Cervical cancer deaths decreased by approximately 74% in the last 50 years, largely due to widespread Pap test screening.[135] The annual direct medical cost of cervical cancer prevention and treatment prior to introduction of the HPV vaccine was estimated at $6 billion.[135]\n\n\n\n### Nigeria[edit]\n\n\nThe Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) reports that 28 Nigerian women lose their lives daily due to this disease. This alarming statistic underscores the pressing need for better awareness, prevention, and treatment efforts across the country. Numerous Nigerian women lack access to these preventive measures. In many regions of the country, screening tests such as Pap tests and HPV tests are not easily accessible or affordable[136][137]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n* 400 BCE: Hippocrates noted that cervical cancer was incurable.\n* 1925: Hinselmann invented the colposcope.\n* 1928: Papanicolaou developed the Papanicolaou technique.\n* 1941: Papanicolaou and Traut: Pap test screening began.\n* 1946: Aylesbury spatula was developed to scrape the cervix, collecting the sample for the Pap test.\n* 1951: First successful in-vitro cell line, HeLa, derived from biopsy of cervical cancer of Henrietta Lacks.\n* 1976: Harald zur Hausen and Gisam found HPV DNA in cervical cancer and genital warts; Hausen later won the Nobel Prize for his work.[138]\n* 1988: Bethesda System for reporting Pap results was developed.\n* 2006: First HPV vaccine was approved by the FDA.\n* 2015: HPV Vaccine shown to protect against infection at multiple body sites.[139]\n* 2018: Evidence for single-dose protection with HPV vaccine.[140]\n\n\nEpidemiologists working in the early 20th century noted that cervical cancer behaved like a sexually transmitted disease. In summary:\n\n\n\n1. Cervical cancer was noted to be common in female sex workers.\n2. It was rare in nuns, except for those who had been sexually active before entering the convent (Rigoni in 1841).\n3. It was more common in the second wives of men whose first wives had died from cervical cancer.\n4. It was rare in Jewish women.[141]\n5. In 1935, Syverton and Berry discovered a relationship between RPV (Rabbit Papillomavirus) and skin cancer in rabbits (HPV is species-specific and therefore cannot be transmitted to rabbits).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThese historical observations suggested that cervical cancer could be caused by a sexually transmitted agent. Initial research in the 1940s and 1950s attributed cervical cancer to smegma.[142] During the 1960s and 1970s it was suspected that infection with herpes simplex virus was the cause of the disease. In summary, HSV was seen as a likely cause because it is known to survive in the female reproductive tract, to be transmitted sexually in a way compatible with known risk factors, such as promiscuity and low socioeconomic status.[143] Herpes viruses were also implicated in other malignant diseases, including Burkitt's lymphoma, Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Marek's disease and the Lucké renal adenocarcinoma. HSV was recovered from cervical tumour cells.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA description of human papillomavirus (HPV) by electron microscopy was given in 1949, and HPV-DNA was identified in 1963.[144] It was not until the 1980s that HPV was identified in cervical cancer tissue.[145] It has since been demonstrated that HPV is implicated in virtually all cervical cancers.[146] Specific viral subtypes implicated are HPV 16, 18, 31, 45 and others.\n\n\nIn work that was initiated in the mid-1980s, the HPV vaccine was developed, in parallel, by researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center, the University of Rochester, the University of Queensland in Australia, and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.[147] In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first preventive HPV vaccine, marketed by Merck & Co. under the trade name Gardasil.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn November 2020, the World Health Organization, under backing from the World Health Assembly, set out a strategy to eliminate cervical cancer by 2050. The strategy involves vaccinating 90% of girls by the age of 15, screening 70% of women by the age of 35 and again by the age of 45, and treating 90% of women identified with cervical disease.[148]\n\n\n\n## Society and culture[edit]\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\nIn Australia, Aboriginal women are more than five times more likely to die from cervical cancer than non-Aboriginal women, suggesting that Aboriginal women are less likely to have regular Pap tests.[149] There are several factors that may limit indigenous women from engaging in regular cervical screening practices, including sensitivity in discussing the topic in Aboriginal communities, embarrassment, anxiety and fear about the procedure.[150] Difficulty in accessing screening services (for example, transport difficulties) and a lack of female GPs, trained Pap test providers and trained female Aboriginal Health Workers are also issues.[150]\n\n\nThe Australian Cervical Cancer Foundation (ACCF), founded in 2008, promotes 'women's health by eliminating cervical cancer and enabling treatment for women with cervical cancer and related health issues, in Australia and in developing countries.'[151] Ian Frazer, one of the developers of the Gardasil cervical cancer vaccine, is the scientific advisor to ACCF.[152] Janette Howard, the wife of the then-Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1996, and first spoke publicly about the disease in 2006.[153]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention public service announcement about cervical cancer health disparities in the United States.\nA 2007 survey of American women found 40% had heard of HPV infection and less than half of those knew it causes cervical cancer.[154] Over a longitudinal study from 1975 to 2000, it was found that people of lower socioeconomic census brackets had higher rates of late-stage cancer diagnosis and higher morbidity rates. After controlling for stage, there still existed differences in survival rates.[155] Women in the US experience stigma around HPV infection, vaccination and cervical cancer. This is predominantly driven by fear of social judgment and rejection, self-blame, and shame, with notable negative influences from gender and social norms, as both human papillomavirus infection and cervical cancer were stigmatized due to the perception that they arise from reckless behavior such as having multiple sexual partners or neglecting screening.[156]\n\n\n\n### LGBTQ populations[edit]\n\n\nTransgender men and gender-diverse people who have a cervix (even if partially intact) or have a prior history of cervical cancer or precancerous conditions, and are age 21 or older who has ever had sex with anyone need to get screened for cervical cancer.[157][158] Transmasculine people are just as likely as cisgender women to have cervical cancer, but are less likely to undergo cervical screening, because of dysphoria, gender disaffirmation or disempowerment of the individual by healthcare providers,[159] or being misinformed of HPV and cervical cancer risks[160] as well as many healthcare providers perceiving transmasculine individuals to be at low risk of cervical cancer.[161]\n\n\nTransgender women who have not had bottom surgery have no risk of cervical cancer, as they do not have a cervix. Trans women who have had bottom surgery to create a vagina (vaginoplasty) and possibly a cervix, are at a very small risk to develop cancer in the tissues of their neo-vagina or neo-cervix as these tissues are made up of different cells than a cervix in a cisgender woman[162][163] Cervical cancer screening is not necessary in trans women who have undergone vaginoplasty because they do not have a cervix.[164]\n\n\nIntersex people with a cervix are also able to have cervical cancer.[165]\n\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"CERVICAL | meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary\". *dictionary.cambridge.org*.

Also, moderate pain during sexual intercourse and vaginal discharge are symptoms of cervical cancer.[27] In advanced disease, metastases may be present in the abdomen, lungs, or elsewhere.[28]\n\n\nSymptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include: loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, pelvic pain, back pain, leg pain, swollen legs, heavy vaginal bleeding, bone fractures, and (rarely) leakage of urine or feces from the vagina.[29] Bleeding after douching or after a pelvic exam is a common symptom of cervical cancer.[30]\n\n\n\n## Causes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In most cases, cells infected with the HPV heal on their own. In some cases, however, the virus continues to spread and becomes an invasive cancer.\n![](image)Cervix in relation to upper part of vagina and posterior portion of uterus, showing difference in covering epithelium of inner structures\nInfection with some types of HPV is the greatest risk factor for cervical cancer, followed by smoking.[31] HIV infection is also a risk factor.[31] Not all of the causes of cervical cancer are known, however, and several other contributing factors have been implicated.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Human papillomavirus[edit]\n\n\nHPV types 16 and 18 are the cause of 75% of cervical cancer cases globally, while 31 and 45 are the causes of another 10%.[34]\n\n\nWomen who have multiple sexual partners, or have partners who have multiple sexual partners, regardless of sex are at higher risk of cervical cancer .[35][36]\n\n\nOf the 150-200 types of HPV known,[37][38] 15 are classified as high-risk types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73, and 82), three as probable high-risk (26, 53, and 66), and 12 as low-risk (6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81, and CP6108).[39]\n\n\nGenital warts, which are a form of benign tumor of epithelial cells, are also caused by various strains of HPV. However, these serotypes are usually not related to cervical cancer. Having multiple strains at the same time is common, including those that can cause cervical cancer along with those that cause warts. Infection with HPV is generally believed to be required for cervical cancer to occur.[40]\n\n\n\n### Smoking[edit]\n\n\nCigarette smoking, both active and passive, increases the risk of cervical cancer. Among HPV-infected women, current and former smokers have roughly two to three times the incidence of invasive cancer. Passive smoking is also associated with increased risk, but to a lesser extent.[41]\n\n\nSmoking has also been linked to the development of cervical cancer.[42][43][31] Smoking can increase the risk in women a few different ways, which can be by direct and indirect methods of inducing cervical cancer.[42][31][44] A direct way of contracting this cancer is a smoker has a higher chance of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) occurring, which has the potential of forming cervical cancer.[42] When CIN3 lesions lead to cancer, most of them have the assistance of the HPV virus, but that is not always the case, which is why it can be considered a direct link to cervical cancer.[44] Heavy smoking and long-term smoking seem to have more of a risk of getting the CIN3 lesions than lighter smoking or not smoking at all.[45] Although smoking has been linked to cervical cancer, it aids in the development of HPV, which is the leading cause of this type of cancer.[31] Also, not only does it aid in the development of HPV, but also if the woman is already HPV-positive, she is at an even greater likelihood of contracting cervical cancer.[45]\n\n\n\n### Oral contraceptives[edit]\n\n\nLong-term use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risk of cervical cancer in women who have had HPV. Women who have used oral contraceptives for 5 to 9 years have about three times the incidence of invasive cancer, and those who used them for 10 years or longer have about four times the risk.[41][46]\n\n\n\n### Multiple pregnancies[edit]\n\n\nHaving many pregnancies is associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer. Among HPV-infected women, those who have had seven or more full-term pregnancies have around four times the risk of cancer compared with women with no pregnancies, and two to three times the risk of women who have had one or two full-term pregnancies.[41]\n\n\n\n## Diagnosis[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cervical cancer seen on a T2-weighted sagittal MR image of the pelvis\n### Biopsy[edit]\n\n\nThe Pap test can be used as a screening test, but produces a false negative in up to 50% of cases of cervical cancer.[47][48] Other concerns is the cost of doing Pap tests, which make them unaffordable in many areas of the world.[49]\n\n\nConfirmation of the diagnosis of cervical cancer or precancer requires a biopsy of the cervix. This is often done through colposcopy, a magnified visual inspection of the cervix aided by using a dilute acetic acid (e.g. vinegar) solution to highlight abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix,[5] with visual contrast provided by staining the normal tissues a mahogany brown with Lugol's iodine.[50] Medical devices used for biopsy of the cervix include punch forceps. Colposcopic impression, the estimate of disease severity based on the visual inspection, forms part of the diagnosis. Further diagnostic and treatment procedures are loop electrical excision procedure and cervical conization, in which the inner lining of the cervix is removed to be examined pathologically. These are carried out if the biopsy confirms severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.[51][52]\n\n\n\n![](image)This large squamous carcinoma (bottom of picture) has obliterated the cervix and invaded the lower uterine segment. The uterus also has a round leiomyoma up higher.\nOften before the biopsy, the doctor asks for medical imaging to rule out other causes of woman's symptoms. Imaging modalities such as ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI have been used to look for alternating disease, spread of the tumor, and effect on adjacent structures. Typically, they appear as heterogeneous mass on the cervix.[53]\n\n\nInterventions such as playing music during the procedure and viewing the procedure on a monitor can reduce the anxiety associated with the examination.[54]\n\n\n\n### Precancerous lesions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Histopathologic image (H&E stain) of carcinoma *in situ* (also called CIN3), stage 0: The normal architecture of stratified squamous epithelium is replaced by irregular cells that extend throughout its full thickness. Normal columnar epithelium is also seen.\nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) means the development of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. It is caused by an HPV infection but in most cases it is resolved by the immune system. However a small percentage of people might develop a more serious CIN which, if left untreated, can develop into cervical cancer.[55][56] CIN is often diagnosed during routine Pap smear examination or colposcopy.[56]\n\n\nThe naming and histologic classification of cervical carcinoma precursor lesions has changed many times over the 20th century. The World Health Organization classification system was descriptive of the lesions, naming them mild, moderate, or severe dysplasia or carcinoma *in situ* (CIS).[57][58] The term cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was developed to place emphasis on the spectrum of abnormality in these lesions, and to help standardize treatment.[58] For premalignant dysplastic changes, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grading (CIN 1-3) is used. It classifies mild dysplasia as CIN1, moderate dysplasia as CIN2, and severe dysplasia and CIS as CIN3.[59] More recently, CIN2 and CIN3 have been combined into CIN2/3. These results are what a pathologist might report from a biopsy.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThese should not be confused with the Bethesda system terms for Pap test (cytopathology) results. Among the Bethesda results: Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). An LSIL Pap may correspond to CIN1, and HSIL may correspond to CIN2 and CIN3,[58] but they are results of different tests, and the Pap test results need not match the histologic findings.[*medical citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cancer subtypes[edit]\n\n\nHistologic subtypes of invasive cervical carcinoma include:[60][61]\n\n\n\n* Squamous cell carcinoma (about 80–85%[62][63])\n* adenocarcinoma (about 15% of cervical cancers in the UK[57])\n* Adenosquamous carcinoma\n* Small cell carcinoma\n* Neuroendocrine tumour\n* Glassy cell carcinoma\n* Villoglandular adenocarcinoma\n\n\n* ![Invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix is characterized by infiltration as irregular anastomosing nests or single cells.[64] This case is poorly differentiated. H&E stain.](image)\n\nInvasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix is characterized by infiltration as irregular anastomosing nests or single cells.[64] This case is poorly differentiated. H&E stain.\n* ![The location of cervical cancer can be described in terms of quadrants, or corresponding to a clock face when the subject is in supine position.](image)\n\nThe location of cervical cancer can be described in terms of quadrants, or corresponding to a clock face when the subject is in supine position.\n\n\nThough squamous cell carcinoma is the cervical cancer with the most incidence, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the cervix has been increasing in recent decades.[5] Endocervical adenocarcinoma represents 20–25% of the histological types of cervical carcinoma. Gastric-type mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cervix is a rare type of cancer with aggressive behavior. This type of malignancy is not related to high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV).[65]\nNoncarcinoma malignancies which can rarely occur in the cervix include melanoma and lymphoma. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage does not incorporate lymph node involvement in contrast to the TNM staging for most other cancers. For cases treated surgically, information obtained from the pathologist can be used in assigning a separate pathologic stage, but is not to replace the original clinical stage.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Staging[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cervical cancer staging\n\nCervical cancer is staged by the FIGO system, which is based on clinical examination rather than surgical findings. Prior to the 2018 revisions to FIGO staging, the system allowed only these diagnostic tests to be used in determining the stage: palpation, inspection, colposcopy, endocervical curettage, hysteroscopy, cystoscopy, proctoscopy, intravenous urography, and X-ray examination of the lungs and skeleton, and cervical conization. However, the current system allows use of any imaging or pathological methods for staging.[66]\n\n\n\n* ![Stage 1A cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 1A cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 1B cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 1B cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 2A cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 2A cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 2B cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 2B cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 3B cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 3B cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 4A cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 4A cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 4B cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 4B cervical cancer\n\n\n## Prevention [edit]\n\n\n### Screening[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cervical screening test vehicle in Taiwan\n![](image)Negative visual inspection with acetic acid of the cervix\n![](image)Positive visual inspection with acetic acid of the cervix for CIN-1\nMain articles: Cervical screening and Pap test\n\nChecking cervical cells with the Papanicolaou test (Pap test) for cervical pre-cancer has dramatically reduced the number of cases of, and mortality from, cervical cancer.[24] Liquid-based cytology may reduce the number of inadequate samples.[67][68][69] Pap test screening every three to five years with appropriate follow-up can reduce cervical cancer incidence up to 80%.[70]\n\n\nPap test screening can reveal abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) that in a small percentage can develop into cervical cancer. These precancerous changes can be confirmed with further examination known as colposcopy.\n\n\nPersonal invitations encouraging women to get screened are effective at increasing the likelihood they will do so. Educational materials also help increase the likelihood women will go for screening, but they are not as effective as invitations.[71]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 European guidelines, the age at which to start screening ranges between 20 and 30 years of age, but preferentially not before age 25 or 30 years, and depends on burden of the disease in the population and the available resources.[70]\n\n\nIn the United States, screening is recommended to begin at age 21, regardless of age at which a woman began having sex or other risk factors.[72] Pap tests should be done every three years between the ages of 21 and 65.[72] In women over the age of 65, screening may be discontinued if no abnormal screening results were seen within the previous 10 years and no history of CIN2 or higher exists.[72][73][74] HPV vaccination status does not change screening rates.[73]\n\n\nA number of recommended options exist for screening those 30 to 65.[75] This includes cervical cytology every 3 years, HPV testing every 5 years, or HPV testing together with cytology every 5 years.[75][73] Screening is not beneficial before age 25, as the rate of disease is low. Screening is not beneficial in women older than 60 years if they have a history of negative results.[41] The American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline has recommend for different levels of resource availability.[76]\n\n\nPap tests have not been as effective in developing countries.[77] This is in part because many of these countries have an impoverished health care infrastructure, too few trained and skilled professionals to obtain and interpret Pap tests, uninformed women who get lost to follow-up, and a lengthy turn-around time to get results.[77] Visual inspection with acetic acid and HPV DNA testing have been tried, though with mixed success.[77]\n\n\n\n### Barrier protection[edit]\n\n\nBarrier protection or spermicidal gel use during sexual intercourse decreases, but does not eliminate risk of transmitting the infection,[41] though condoms may protect against genital warts.[78] They also provide protection against other sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and *Chlamydia*, which are associated with greater risks of developing cervical cancer.[*medical citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Vaccination[edit]\n\n\nThree HPV vaccines (Gardasil, Gardasil 9, and Cervarix) reduce the risk of cancerous or precancerous changes of the cervix and perineum by about 93% and 62%, respectively.[79] The vaccines are between 92% and 100% effective against HPV 16 and 18 up to at least 8 years.[41]\n\n\nHPV vaccines are typically given to age 9 to 26, as the vaccine is most effective if given before infection occurs. The duration of effectiveness and whether a booster will be needed is unknown. The high cost of this vaccine has been a cause for concern. Several countries have considered (or are considering) programs to fund HPV vaccination. The American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline has recommendations for different levels of resource availability.[76]\n\n\nSince 2010, young women in Japan have been eligible to receive the cervical cancer vaccination for free.[80] In June 2013, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare mandated that, before administering the vaccine, medical institutions must inform women that the ministry does not recommend it.[80] However, the vaccine is still available at no cost to Japanese women who choose to accept the vaccination.[80]\n\n\n\n### Nutrition[edit]\n\n\nVitamin A is associated with a lower risk[81] as are vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-Carotene.[82]\n\n\n\n## Treatment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cervical cryotherapy\nThe treatment of cervical cancer varies worldwide, largely due to access to surgeons skilled in radical pelvic surgery, and the emergence of fertility-sparing therapy in developed nations. Less advanced stages of cervical cancer typically have treatment options that allow fertility to be maintained, if the patient desires.[83]\n\n\nBecause cervical cancers are radiosensitive, radiation may be used in all stages where surgical options do not exist. Surgical intervention may have better outcomes than radiological approaches.[84] In addition, chemotherapy can be used to treat cervical cancer, and has been found to be more effective than radiation alone.[85] Chemoradiotherapy may increase overall survival and reduce the risk of disease recurrence compared to radiotherapy alone.[86]\n\n\nPrecancerous cells (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) that would lead to cancer and early-stage cervical cancer (IA1) can be treated effectively by various surgical techniques. Surgical treatment methods include excision, where a cone-shaped portion of the cervix is removed, and ablation which removes only the parts with abnormal tissues. While these effectively reduce the risk of the cancer developing or spreading, they cause an increased risk of premature birth in future pregnancies. Surgical techniques that remove more cervical tissue come with less risk of the cancer recurring but a higher chance of giving birth prematurely. Due to this risk, taking into account the age, childbearing plans of the woman, the size and location of the cancer cells are crucial for choosing the right procedure.[51][52] There is low-certainty evidence that peri-operative care approaches, such as 'fast-track surgery' or 'enhanced recovery programmes' may lower surgical stress and improve recovery after gynaecological cancer surgery.[87]\n\n\nMicroinvasive cancer (stage IA) may also be treated by hysterectomy (removal of the whole uterus including part of the vagina).[88] For stage IA2, the lymph nodes are removed as well. Alternatives include local surgical procedures such as a loop electrical excision procedure or cone biopsy.[89][90] A systematic review concluded that more evidence is needed to inform decisions about different surgical techniques for women with cervical cancer at stage IA2.[91]\n\n\nIf a cone biopsy does not produce clear margins[92] (findings on biopsy showing that the tumor is surrounded by cancer free tissue, suggesting all of the tumor is removed), one more possible treatment option for women who want to preserve their fertility is a trachelectomy.[93] This attempts to surgically remove the cancer while preserving the ovaries and uterus, providing for a more conservative operation than a hysterectomy. It is a viable option for those in stage I cervical cancer which has not spread; however, it is not yet considered a standard of care,[94] as few doctors are skilled in this procedure. Even the most experienced surgeon cannot promise that a trachelectomy can be performed until after surgical microscopic examination, as the extent of the spread of cancer is unknown. If the surgeon is not able to microscopically confirm clear margins of cervical tissue once the woman is under general anesthesia in the operating room, a hysterectomy may still be needed. This can only be done during the same operation if the woman has given prior consent. Due to the possible risk of cancer spread to the lymph nodes in stage 1B cancers and some stage 1A cancers, the surgeon may also need to remove some lymph nodes from around the uterus for pathologic evaluation.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA radical trachelectomy can be performed abdominally[95] or vaginally[96] and opinions are conflicting as to which is better.[97] A radical abdominal trachelectomy with lymphadenectomy usually only requires a two- to three-day hospital stay, and most women recover very quickly (about six weeks). Complications are uncommon, although women who are able to conceive after surgery are susceptible to preterm labor and possible late miscarriage.[98] A wait of at least one year is generally recommended before attempting to become pregnant after surgery.[99] Recurrence in the residual cervix is very rare if the cancer has been cleared with the trachelectomy.[94] Yet, women are recommended to practice vigilant prevention and follow-up care including Pap screenings/colposcopy, with biopsies of the remaining lower uterine segment as needed (every 3–4 months for at least 5 years) to monitor for any recurrence in addition to minimizing any new exposures to HPV through safe sex practices until one is actively trying to conceive.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nEarly stages (IB1 and IIA less than 4 cm) can be treated with radical hysterectomy with removal of the lymph nodes or radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is given as external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis and brachytherapy (internal radiation). Women treated with surgery who have high-risk features found on pathologic examination are given radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy to reduce the risk of relapse.[*citation needed*] A Cochrane review has found moderate-certainty evidence that radiation decreases the risk of disease progression in people with stage IB cervical cancer, when compared to no further treatment.[100] However, little evidence was found on its effects on overall survival.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)Brachytherapy for cervical cancer\nLarger early-stage tumors (IB2 and IIA more than 4 cm) may be treated with radiation therapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy, hysterectomy (which then usually requires adjuvant radiation therapy), or cisplatin chemotherapy followed by hysterectomy. When cisplatin is present, it is thought to be the most active single agent in periodic diseases.[101] Such addition of platinum-based chemotherapy to chemoradiation seems not only to improve survival but also reduces risk of recurrence in women with early stage cervical cancer (IA2–IIA).[102] A Cochrane review found a lack of evidence on the benefits and harms of primary hysterectomy compared to primary chemoradiotherapy for cervical cancer in stage IB2.[103]\n\n\nAdvanced-stage tumors (IIB-IVA) are treated with radiation therapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. On 15 June 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of a combination of two chemotherapy drugs, hycamtin and cisplatin, for women with late-stage (IVB) cervical cancer treatment.[104] Combination treatment has significant risk of neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia side effects.[105]\n\n\nThere is insufficient evidence whether anticancer drugs after standard care help women with locally advanced cervical cancer to live longer.[106]\n\n\nFor surgery to be curative, the entire cancer must be removed with no cancer found at the margins of the removed tissue on examination under a microscope.[107] This procedure is known as exenteration.[107]\n\n\nNo evidence is available to suggest that any form of follow‐up approach is better or worse in terms of prolonging survival, improving quality of life or guiding the management of problems that can arise because of the treatment and that in the case of radiotherapy treatment worsen with time.[108] A 2019 review found no controlled trials regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for vaginal bleeding in women with advanced cervical cancer.[109]\n\n\nTisotumab vedotin (Tivdak) was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2021.[110][111]\n\n\n\n* ![Diagram showing the area removed with a posterior surgery](image)\n\nDiagram showing the area removed with a posterior surgery\n* ![Diagram showing the area removed with a total operation](image)\n\nDiagram showing the area removed with a total operation\n* ![Diagram showing the area removed with an anterior operation](image)\n\nDiagram showing the area removed with an anterior operation\n\n\n## Prognosis[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

For intraepithelial cervical neoplasmas the prognosis is good.[112] With treatment, the five-year relative survival rate for the earliest stage of invasive cervical cancer is 92%, and the overall (all stages combined) five-year survival rate is about 66%. These statistics may be improved when applied to women newly diagnosed, bearing in mind that these outcomes may be partly based on the state of treatment five years ago when the women studied were first diagnosed.[113]\n\n\nWith treatment, 80–90% of women with stage I cancer and 60–75% of those with stage II cancer are alive 5 years after diagnosis. Survival rates decrease to 58% for women with stage III cancer and 17% or fewer of those with stage IV cancer five years after diagnosis.[113] Recurrent cervical cancer detected at its earliest stages might be successfully treated with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or a combination of the three. About 35% of women with invasive cervical cancer have persistent or recurrent disease after treatment.[114]\n\n\n\n### By country[edit]\n\n\nFive-year survival in the United States for White women is 69% and for Black women is 57%.[*needs update*][115]\n\n\nRegular screening has meant that precancerous changes and early-stage cervical cancers have been detected and treated early. Figures suggest that cervical screening is saving 5,000 lives each year in the UK by preventing cervical cancer.[116]\nAbout 1,000 women per year die of cervical cancer in the UK. All of the Nordic countries have cervical cancer-screening programs in place.[117] The Pap test was integrated into clinical practice in the Nordic countries in the 1960s.[117]\n\n\nIn Africa outcomes are often worse as diagnosis is frequently at a latter stage of disease.[118] In a scoping review of publicly-available cervical cancer prevention and control plans from African countries, plans tended to emphasize survivorship rather than early HPV diagnosis and prevention.[119]\n\n\n\n## Epidemiology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Age-standardized death from cervical cancer per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004[120] |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| no data\n <2.4\n 2.4–4.8\n 4.8–7.2\n 7.2–9.6\n 9.6–12\n 12–14.4\n | 14.4–16.8\n 16.8–19.2\n 19.2–21.6\n 21.6–24\n 24–26.4\n >26.4\n |\n\nWorldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and deaths from cancer in women.[3] In 2018, 570,000 cases of cervical cancer were estimated to have occurred, with over 300,000 deaths.[121] It is the second-most common cause of female-specific cancer after breast cancer, accounting for around 8% of both total cancer cases and total cancer deaths in women.[21] About 80% of cervical cancers occur in developing countries.[122] It is the most frequently detected cancer during pregnancy, with an occurrence of 1.5 to 12 for every 100,000 pregnancies.[123]\n\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(September 2021)*\n |\n\n\nIn 2022, it is estimated that 942 new cases of cervical cancer will be diagnosed in Australia. In 2022, it is estimated that a female has a 1 in 180 (or 0.56%) risk of being diagnosed with cervical cancer by the age of 85.[124]\n\n\nIn 2020, there were 165 women aged 25–74 who died from cervical cancer, which is a mortality rate of 2 deaths per 100,000 women in the population. Over the 5 years 2016–2020, there were 62 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women aged 25–74 who died from cervical cancer, which is a mortality rate of 7 deaths per 100,000 Indigenous women in the population. Over the 5 years 2016–2020, the age-standardised mortality rate among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women was 3.8 times the rate of non-Indigenous Australians.[125]\n\n\nThe number of women diagnosed with cervical cancer has dropped on average by 4.5% each year since organised screening began in 1991 (1991–2005).[126] Regular twice-yearly Pap tests can reduce the incidence of cervical cancer up to 90% in Australia, and save 1,200 Australian women from dying from the disease each year.[127] It is predicted that because of the success of the primary HPV testing programme there will be fewer than four new cases per 100 000 women annually by 2028.[128]\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nAn estimated 1,450 Canadians will be diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2022. An estimated 380 will die from it.[129]\n\n\n\n### India[edit]\n\n\nIn India, the number of people with cervical cancer is rising, but overall the age-adjusted rates are decreasing.[130] Usage of condoms in the female population has improved the survival of women with cancers of the cervix.[131]\n\n\n\n### European Union[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2022, the World Health Organization announced that \"each year in the WHO European Region more than 66 000 women are newly diagnosed with cervical cancer and more than 30 000 die from this preventable disease.\"[132]\n\n\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

The rates of new cases in the United States was 7.3 per 100,000 women, based on rates from 2012 to 2016. Cervical cancer deaths decreased by approximately 74% in the last 50 years, largely due to widespread Pap test screening.[135] The annual direct medical cost of cervical cancer prevention and treatment prior to introduction of the HPV vaccine was estimated at $6 billion.[135]\n\n\n\n### Nigeria[edit]\n\n\nThe Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) reports that 28 Nigerian women lose their lives daily due to this disease. This alarming statistic underscores the pressing need for better awareness, prevention, and treatment efforts across the country. Numerous Nigerian women lack access to these preventive measures. In many regions of the country, screening tests such as Pap tests and HPV tests are not easily accessible or affordable[136][137]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n* 400 BCE: Hippocrates noted that cervical cancer was incurable.\n* 1925: Hinselmann invented the colposcope.\n* 1928: Papanicolaou developed the Papanicolaou technique.\n* 1941: Papanicolaou and Traut: Pap test screening began.\n* 1946: Aylesbury spatula was developed to scrape the cervix, collecting the sample for the Pap test.\n* 1951: First successful in-vitro cell line, HeLa, derived from biopsy of cervical cancer of Henrietta Lacks.\n* 1976: Harald zur Hausen and Gisam found HPV DNA in cervical cancer and genital warts; Hausen later won the Nobel Prize for his work.[138]\n* 1988: Bethesda System for reporting Pap results was developed.\n* 2006: First HPV vaccine was approved by the FDA.\n* 2015: HPV Vaccine shown to protect against infection at multiple body sites.[139]\n* 2018: Evidence for single-dose protection with HPV vaccine.[140]\n\n\nEpidemiologists working in the early 20th century noted that cervical cancer behaved like a sexually transmitted disease. In summary:\n\n\n\n1. Cervical cancer was noted to be common in female sex workers.\n2. It was rare in nuns, except for those who had been sexually active before entering the convent (Rigoni in 1841).\n3. It was more common in the second wives of men whose first wives had died from cervical cancer.\n4. It was rare in Jewish women.[141]\n5. In 1935, Syverton and Berry discovered a relationship between RPV (Rabbit Papillomavirus) and skin cancer in rabbits (HPV is species-specific and therefore cannot be transmitted to rabbits).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThese historical observations suggested that cervical cancer could be caused by a sexually transmitted agent. Initial research in the 1940s and 1950s attributed cervical cancer to smegma.[142] During the 1960s and 1970s it was suspected that infection with herpes simplex virus was the cause of the disease. In summary, HSV was seen as a likely cause because it is known to survive in the female reproductive tract, to be transmitted sexually in a way compatible with known risk factors, such as promiscuity and low socioeconomic status.[143] Herpes viruses were also implicated in other malignant diseases, including Burkitt's lymphoma, Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Marek's disease and the Lucké renal adenocarcinoma. HSV was recovered from cervical tumour cells.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA description of human papillomavirus (HPV) by electron microscopy was given in 1949, and HPV-DNA was identified in 1963.[144] It was not until the 1980s that HPV was identified in cervical cancer tissue.[145] It has since been demonstrated that HPV is implicated in virtually all cervical cancers.[146] Specific viral subtypes implicated are HPV 16, 18, 31, 45 and others.\n\n\nIn work that was initiated in the mid-1980s, the HPV vaccine was developed, in parallel, by researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center, the University of Rochester, the University of Queensland in Australia, and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.[147] In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first preventive HPV vaccine, marketed by Merck & Co. under the trade name Gardasil.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn November 2020, the World Health Organization, under backing from the World Health Assembly, set out a strategy to eliminate cervical cancer by 2050. The strategy involves vaccinating 90% of girls by the age of 15, screening 70% of women by the age of 35 and again by the age of 45, and treating 90% of women identified with cervical disease.[148]\n\n\n\n## Society and culture[edit]\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\nIn Australia, Aboriginal women are more than five times more likely to die from cervical cancer than non-Aboriginal women, suggesting that Aboriginal women are less likely to have regular Pap tests.[149] There are several factors that may limit indigenous women from engaging in regular cervical screening practices, including sensitivity in discussing the topic in Aboriginal communities, embarrassment, anxiety and fear about the procedure.[150] Difficulty in accessing screening services (for example, transport difficulties) and a lack of female GPs, trained Pap test providers and trained female Aboriginal Health Workers are also issues.[150]\n\n\nThe Australian Cervical Cancer Foundation (ACCF), founded in 2008, promotes 'women's health by eliminating cervical cancer and enabling treatment for women with cervical cancer and related health issues, in Australia and in developing countries.'[151] Ian Frazer, one of the developers of the Gardasil cervical cancer vaccine, is the scientific advisor to ACCF.[152] Janette Howard, the wife of the then-Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1996, and first spoke publicly about the disease in 2006.[153]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention public service announcement about cervical cancer health disparities in the United States.\nA 2007 survey of American women found 40% had heard of HPV infection and less than half of those knew it causes cervical cancer.[154] Over a longitudinal study from 1975 to 2000, it was found that people of lower socioeconomic census brackets had higher rates of late-stage cancer diagnosis and higher morbidity rates. After controlling for stage, there still existed differences in survival rates.[155] Women in the US experience stigma around HPV infection, vaccination and cervical cancer. This is predominantly driven by fear of social judgment and rejection, self-blame, and shame, with notable negative influences from gender and social norms, as both human papillomavirus infection and cervical cancer were stigmatized due to the perception that they arise from reckless behavior such as having multiple sexual partners or neglecting screening.[156]\n\n\n\n### LGBTQ populations[edit]\n\n\nTransgender men and gender-diverse people who have a cervix (even if partially intact) or have a prior history of cervical cancer or precancerous conditions, and are age 21 or older who has ever had sex with anyone need to get screened for cervical cancer.[157][158] Transmasculine people are just as likely as cisgender women to have cervical cancer, but are less likely to undergo cervical screening, because of dysphoria, gender disaffirmation or disempowerment of the individual by healthcare providers,[159] or being misinformed of HPV and cervical cancer risks[160] as well as many healthcare providers perceiving transmasculine individuals to be at low risk of cervical cancer.[161]\n\n\nTransgender women who have not had bottom surgery have no risk of cervical cancer, as they do not have a cervix. Trans women who have had bottom surgery to create a vagina (vaginoplasty) and possibly a cervix, are at a very small risk to develop cancer in the tissues of their neo-vagina or neo-cervix as these tissues are made up of different cells than a cervix in a cisgender woman[162][163] Cervical cancer screening is not necessary in trans women who have undergone vaginoplasty because they do not have a cervix.[164]\n\n\nIntersex people with a cervix are also able to have cervical cancer.[165]\n\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"CERVICAL | meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary\". *dictionary.cambridge.org*.

Its histology was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells. Left above: normal, right above: FICE, left low: acetate stained, right low: AIM stained\nStomach cancer is often either asymptomatic (producing no noticeable symptoms) or it may cause only nonspecific symptoms (which may also be present in other related or unrelated disorders) in its early stages. By the time symptoms are recognized, the cancer has often reached an advanced stage (see below) and may have metastasized (spread to other, perhaps distant, parts of the body), which is one of the main reasons for its relatively poor prognosis.[22] Stomach cancer can cause the following signs and symptoms: Unexplained nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation. Patients also can experience unexplained weight loss.[23]\n\n\nEarly cancers may be associated with indigestion or a burning sensation (heartburn). However, fewer than one in every 50 people referred for endoscopy due to indigestion has cancer.[24] Abdominal discomfort and loss of appetite, especially for meat, can occur.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGastric cancers that have enlarged and invaded normal tissue can cause weakness, fatigue, bloating of the stomach after meals, abdominal pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and occasional vomiting. Further enlargement may cause weight loss or bleeding with vomiting blood or having blood in the stool, the latter apparent as black discolouration (melena) and sometimes leading to anemia. Dysphagia suggests a tumour in the cardia or extension of the gastric tumour into the esophagus.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThese can be symptoms of other problems such as a stomach virus, gastric ulcer, or tropical sprue.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Risk factors[edit]\n\n\nGastric cancer can occur as a result of many factors.[25] It occurs twice as commonly in males as females. Estrogen may protect women against the development of this form of cancer.[26][27]\n\n\n\n### Infections[edit]\n\n\n*Helicobacter pylori* infection is an essential risk factor in 65–80% of gastric cancers, but only 2% of people with *H. pylori* infections develop stomach cancer.[4][28] The mechanism by which *H. pylori* induces stomach cancer potentially involves chronic inflammation, the action of *H. pylori* virulence factors such as CagA,[29] or an interaction between *H. pylori* infection and germline pathogenic variants in homologous-recombination genes.[30] It was estimated that Epstein–Barr virus is responsible for 84,000 cases per year.[31] AIDS is also associated with elevated risk.[4]\n\n\n\n### Smoking[edit]\n\n\nSmoking increases the risk of developing gastric cancer significantly, from 40% increased risk for current smokers to 82% increase for heavy smokers. Gastric cancers due to smoking mostly occur in the upper part of the stomach near the esophagus.[32][33][34]\n\n\n\n### Alcohol[edit]\n\n\nSome studies show increased risk with alcohol consumption as well.[4][35]\n\n\n\n### Diet[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sequence of 123-iodine human scintiscans after an intravenous injection: (from left) after 30 minutes, 20 hours, and 48 hours - a high and rapid concentration of radio-iodine is evident in gastric mucosa of the stomach, in salivary glands, oral mucosa, and the periencephalic and cerebrospinal fluid (left). In the thyroid gland, I-concentration is more progressive, also in the reservoir (from 1% after 30 minutes to 5.8% after 48 hours, of the total injected dose).[36]\nDietary factors are not proven causes, and the association between stomach cancer and various foods and beverages is weak.[37] Some foods including smoked foods, salt and salt-rich foods, red meat, processed meat, pickled vegetables, and brackens are associated with a higher risk of stomach cancer.[4][38][39] Nitrates and nitrites in cured meats can be converted by certain bacteria, including *H. pylori*, into compounds that have been found to cause stomach cancer in animals.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFresh fruit and vegetable intake, citrus fruit intake, and antioxidant intake are associated with a lower risk of stomach cancer.[4][32] A Mediterranean diet is associated with lower rates of stomach cancer,[40] as is regular aspirin use.[4]\n\n\nObesity is a physical risk factor that has been found to increase the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma by contributing to the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).[41] The exact mechanism by which obesity causes GERD is not completely known. Studies hypothesize that increased dietary fat leading to increased pressure on the stomach and the lower esophageal sphincter, due to excess adipose tissue, could play a role, yet no statistically significant data have been collected.[42] However, the risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, with GERD present, has been found to increase more than 2 times for an obese person.[41] There is a correlation between iodine deficiency and gastric cancer.[43][44][45]\n\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nAbout 10% of cases run in families, and between 1 and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.[2]\n\n\nA genetic risk factor for gastric cancer is a genetic defect of the *CDH1* gene known as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). The *CDH1* gene, which codes for E-cadherin, lies on the 16th chromosome.[46] When the gene experiences a particular mutation, gastric cancer develops through a mechanism that is not fully understood.[46][47] This mutation is considered autosomal dominant, meaning that half of a carrier's children will likely experience the same mutation.[46] Diagnosis of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer usually takes place when at least two cases involving a family member, such as a parent or grandparent, are diagnosed, with at least one diagnosed before the age of 50.[46] The diagnosis can also be made if at least three cases occur in the family, in which case age is not considered.[46]\n\n\nThe International Cancer Genome Consortium is leading efforts to identify genomic changes involved in stomach cancer.[48][49] A very small percentage of diffuse-type gastric cancers (see Histopathology below) arise from an inherited abnormal *CDH1* gene. Genetic testing and treatment options are available for families at risk.[50]\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nOther risk factors include diabetes,[51] pernicious anemia,[35] chronic atrophic gastritis,[52] Menetrier's disease (hyperplastic, hypersecretory gastropathy),[53] and intestinal metaplasia.[54]\n\n\nIn addition, Foxp3 polymorphism (rs3761548) might contribute to gastric cancer development through influencing Treg cell activity.[55]\n\n\nIn a human retrospective study, biliary reflux was found to be a likely risk factor for gastric cancer and precancerous lesions.[56]\n\n\n\n## Diagnosis[edit]\n\n\nTo find the cause of symptoms, the doctor asks about the patient's medical history, does a physical examination, and may order laboratory studies.[57]\nThe patient may also have one or all of these exams:\n\n\n\n* Gastroscopic exam is the diagnostic method of choice. This involves insertion of a fibre optic camera into the stomach to visualise it.[35]\n* Upper GI series (may be called barium roentgenogram)\n* Computed tomography or CT scanning of the abdomen may reveal gastric cancer. It is more useful to determine invasion into adjacent tissues or the presence of spread to local lymph nodes. Wall thickening of more than 1 cm that is focal, eccentric, and enhancing favours malignancy.[58]\n\n\nIn 2013, Chinese and Israeli scientists reported a successful pilot study of a breathalyzer-style breath test intended to diagnose stomach cancer by analyzing exhaled chemicals without the need for an intrusive endoscopy.[59][60] A larger-scale clinical trial of this technology was completed in 2014.[61][62]\n\n\nAbnormal tissue seen in a gastroscope examination is biopsied by the surgeon or gastroenterologist. This tissue is then sent to a pathologist for histological examination under a microscope to check for the presence of cancerous cells. A biopsy, with subsequent histological analysis, is the only sure way to confirm the presence of cancer cells.[35]\n\n\nVarious gastroscopic modalities have been developed to increase yield of detected mucosa with a dye that accentuates the cell structure and can identify areas of dysplasia. Endocytoscopy involves ultra-high magnification to visualise cellular structure to better determine areas of dysplasia. Other gastroscopic modalities such as optical coherence tomography are being tested investigationally for similar applications.[63]\n\n\nA number of cutaneous conditions are associated with gastric cancer. A condition of darkened hyperplasia of the skin, frequently of the axilla and groin, known as acanthosis nigricans, is associated with intra-abdominal cancers such as gastric cancer. Other cutaneous manifestations of gastric cancer include \"tripe palms\" (a similar darkening hyperplasia of the skin of the palms) and the Leser-Trelat sign, which is the rapid development of skin lesions known as seborrheic keratoses.[64]\n\n\nVarious blood tests may be done, including a complete blood count to check for anaemia, and a fecal occult blood test to check for blood in the stool.[65]\n\n\n\n### Histopathology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stomach cancer types by relative incidence[66]\n* *Gastric adenocarcinoma* is a malignant epithelial tumour, originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Stomach cancers are about 90% adenocarcinomas.[67] Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa and then the muscularis propria. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumour cells describe irregular tubular structures, harbouring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (\"back to back\" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighbouring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiated. Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica or leather-bottle stomach) tumour cells are discohesive and secrete mucus, which is delivered in the interstitium, producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically \"empty\" spaces). It is poorly differentiated. In signet-ring cell carcinomas, the mucus remains inside the tumour cell and pushes the nucleus to the periphery, giving rise to signet-ring cells.[*citation needed*]\n* Around 5% of gastric cancers are lymphomas.[68] These may include extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MALT type)[69] and to a lesser extent diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.[70] MALT type make up about half of stomach lymphomas.[16]\n* Carcinoid and stromal tumors may occur.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n* ![Poor to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach.

H&E stain.\n\n\n### Staging[edit]\n\n\n![](image)T stages of stomach cancer\nIf cancer cells are found in the tissue sample, the next step is to stage, or find out the extent of the disease. Various tests determine whether the cancer has spread, and if so, what parts of the body are affected. Because stomach cancer can spread to the liver, pancreas, and other organs near the stomach, as well as to the lungs, the doctor may order a CT scan, a PET scan,[71] an endoscopic ultrasound exam, or other tests to check these areas. Blood tests for tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen may be ordered, as their levels correlate to extent of metastasis, especially to the liver, and the cure rate.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nStaging may not be complete until after surgery. The surgeon removes nearby lymph nodes and possibly samples of tissue from other areas in the abdomen for examination by a pathologist.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe clinical stages of stomach cancer are:[72][73]\n\n\n\n* **Stage 0** – Limited to the inner lining of the stomach, it is treatable by endoscopic mucosal resection when found very early (in routine screenings), or otherwise by gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy without need for chemotherapy or radiation.\n* **Stage I** – Penetration to the second or third layers of the stomach (stage 1A) or to the second layer and nearby lymph nodes (stage 1B): Stage 1A is treated by surgery, including removal of the omentum. Stage 1B may be treated with chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil) and radiation therapy.\n* **Stage II** – Penetration to the second layer and more distant lymph nodes, or the third layer and only nearby lymph nodes, or all four layers but not the lymph nodes, it is treated as for stage I, sometimes with additional neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n* **Stage III** – Penetration to the third layer and more distant lymph nodes, or penetration to the fourth layer and either nearby tissues or nearby or more distant lymph nodes, it is treated as for stage II; a cure is still possible in some cases.\n* **Stage IV** – Cancer has spread to nearby tissues and more distant lymph nodes, or has metastasized to other organs. A cure is very rarely possible at this stage. Some other techniques to prolong life or improve symptoms are used, including laser treatment, surgery, and/or stents to keep the digestive tract open, and chemotherapy by drugs such as 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, epirubicin, etoposide, docetaxel, oxaliplatin, capecitabine, or irinotecan.[14]\n\n\n![](image)Stomach cancer metastasized to the lungs\nThe TNM staging system is also used.[74]\n\n\nIn a study of open-access endoscopy in Scotland, patients were diagnosed 7% in stage I, 17% in stage II, and 28% in stage III.[75] A Minnesota population was diagnosed 10% in stage I, 13% in stage II, and 18% in stage III.[76] However, in a high-risk population in the Valdivia Province of southern Chile, only 5% of patients were diagnosed in the first two stages and 10% in stage III.[77]\n\n\n\n## Prevention[edit]\n\n\nGetting rid of *H. pylori* in those who are infected decreases the risk of stomach cancer.[78] A 2014 meta-analysis of observational studies found that a diet high in fruits, mushrooms, garlic, soybeans, and green onions was associated with a lower risk of stomach cancer in the Korean population.[79] Low doses of vitamins, especially from a healthy diet, decrease the risk of stomach cancer.[80] A previous review of antioxidant supplementation did not find supporting evidence and possibly worse outcomes.[81][82] Modern technology is used to promote early diagnosis, e.g. based on serum markers.[83]\n\n\n\n## Management[edit]\n\n\nCancer of the stomach is difficult to cure unless it is found at an early stage (before it has begun to spread). Unfortunately, because early stomach cancer causes few symptoms, the disease is usually advanced when the diagnosis is made.[84]\n\n\nTreatment for stomach cancer may include surgery,[85] chemotherapy,[14] or radiation therapy.[86] New treatment approaches such as immunotherapy or gene therapy and improved ways of using current methods are being studied in clinical trials.[87]\n\n\n\n### Surgery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anatomy before Roux-en-y surgery to resect stomach cancer\nSurgery remains the only curative therapy for stomach cancer.[6] Of the different surgical techniques, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a treatment for early gastric cancer (tumor only involves the mucosa) that was pioneered in Japan and is available in the United States at some centers.[6] In EMR, the tumor, together with the inner lining of stomach (mucosa), is removed from the wall of the stomach using an electrical wire loop through the endoscope. The advantage is that it is a much smaller operation than removing the stomach.[6] Endoscopic submucosal dissection is a similar technique pioneered in Japan, used to resect a large area of mucosa in one piece.[6] If the pathologic examination of the resected specimen shows incomplete resection or deep invasion by tumor, the patient would need a formal stomach resection.[6] A 2016 Cochrane review found low-quality evidence of no difference in short-term mortality between laparoscopic and open gastrectomy (removal of stomach), and that benefits or harms of laparoscopic gastrectomy cannot be ruled out.[88] Post-operatively, up to 70% of people undergoing total gastrectomy develop complications such as dumping syndrome and reflux esophagitis.[89] Construction of a \"pouch\", which serves as a \"stomach substitute\", reduced the incidence of dumping syndrome and reflux esophagitis by 73% and 63% respectively, and led to improvements in quality-of-life, nutritional outcomes, and body mass index.[89]\n\n\nThose with metastatic disease at the time of presentation may receive palliative surgery, and while it remains controversial, due to the possibility of complications from the surgery itself and because it may delay chemotherapy, the data so far are mostly positive, with improved survival rates being seen in those treated with this approach.[6][90]\n\n\n\n### Chemotherapy[edit]\n\n\nThe use of chemotherapy to treat stomach cancer has no firmly established standard of care.[14] Unfortunately, stomach cancer has not been particularly sensitive to these drugs, and chemotherapy, if used, has usually served to palliatively reduce the size of the tumor, relieve symptoms of the disease, and increase survival time.[14] Some drugs used in stomach cancer treatment have included: fluorouracil or its analog capecitabine, BCNU (carmustine), methyl-CCNU (semustine) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin), as well as mitomycin C, and more recently cisplatin and taxotere, often using drugs in various combinations.[14] The relative benefits of these different drugs, alone and in combination, are unclear.[14][91] Clinical researchers are exploring the benefits of giving chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the tumor, or as adjuvant therapy after surgery to destroy remaining cancer cells.[6]\n\n\n\n### Targeted therapy[edit]\n\n\nRecently[*when?*], treatment with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (*HER2*) inhibitor, trastuzumab, has been demonstrated to increase overall survival in inoperable locally advanced or metastatic gastric carcinoma over-expressing the *HER2/neu* gene.[6] In particular, *HER2* is overexpressed in 13–22% of patients with gastric cancer.[87][92] Of note, *HER2* overexpression in gastric neoplasia is heterogeneous and comprises a minority of tumor cells (less than 10% of gastric cancers overexpress *HER2* in more than 5% of tumor cells). Hence, this heterogeneous expression should be taken into account for *HER2* testing, particularly in small samples such as biopsies, requiring the evaluation of more than one bioptic sample.[92]\n\n\n\n### Radiation[edit]\n\n\nRadiation therapy (also called radiotherapy) may be used to treat stomach cancer, often as an adjuvant to chemotherapy and/or surgery.[6]\n\n\n\n### Lymphoma[edit]\n\n\nMALT lymphomas are often completely resolved after the underlying *H. pylori* infection is treated.[16] This results in remission in about 80% of cases.[16]\n\n\n\n## Prognosis[edit]\n\n\nThe prognosis of stomach cancer is generally poor, because the tumor has often metastasized by the time of discovery, and most people with the condition are elderly (median age is between 70 and 75 years) at presentation.[93] The average life expectancy after being diagnosed is around 24 months, and the five-year survival rate for stomach cancer is less than 10%.[6]\n\n\nAlmost 300 genes are related to outcomes in stomach cancer, with both unfavorable genes where high expression is related to poor survival and favorable genes where high expression is associated with longer survival times.[94][95] Examples of poor prognosis genes include ITGAV, DUSP1 and P2RX7.[96]\n\n\n\n## Epidemiology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stomach cancer deaths per million persons in 2012 0–11\n12–16\n17–24\n25–33\n34–51\n52–76\n77–102\n103–128\n129–175\n176–400\n\nIn 2018, stomach cancer was the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide, representing 5.7% of all cancer cases, and the third leading cause of death from cancers, being responsible for 8.2% of all cancer deaths.[97] Among men, 683 754 cases were diagnosed, accounting for 7.2% of all cancer cases, and among women, stomach cancer was diagnosed in 349 947 cases, accounting for 4.1% of all cancer cases.[97]\n\n\nIn 2012, stomach cancer was the fifth most-common cancer with 952,000 cases diagnosed.[17] It is more common both in men and in developing countries.[98][99] In 2012, it represented 8.5% of cancer cases in men, making it the fourth-most common cancer in men.[100] Also in 2012, the number of deaths was 700,000, having decreased slightly from 774,000 in 1990, making it the third-leading cause of cancer-related death (after lung cancer and liver cancer).[101][102]\n\n\nLess than 5% of stomach cancers occur in people under 40 years of age, with 81.1% of that 5% in the age-group of 30 to 39 and 18.9% in the age-group of 20 to 29.[103]\n\n\nIn 2014, stomach cancer resulted in 0.61% of deaths (13,303 cases) in the U.S.[104] In China, stomach cancer accounted for 3.56% of all deaths (324,439 cases).[105][*unreliable source?*] The highest rate of stomach cancer was in Mongolia, at 28 cases per 100,000 people.[106][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, stomach cancer is the 15th-most common cancer (around 7,100 people were diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2011), and it is the 10th-most common cause of cancer-related deaths (around 4,800 people died in 2012).[107]\n\n\nIncidence and mortality rates of gastric cancer vary greatly in Africa. The GLOBOCAN system is currently the most widely used method to compare these rates between countries, but African incidence and mortality rates are seen to differ among countries, possibly due to the lack of universal access to a registry system for all countries.[108] Variation as drastic as estimated rates from 0.3/100000 in Botswana to 20.3/100000 in Mali have been observed.[108] In Uganda, the incidence of gastric cancer has increased from the 1960s measurement of 0.8/100000 to 5.6/100000.[108] Gastric cancer, though present, is relatively low when compared to countries with high incidence like Japan and China. One suspected cause of the variation within Africa and between other countries is due to different strains of the *H. pylori* bacteria. The trend commonly seen is that *H. pylori* infection increases the risk for gastric cancer, but this is not the case in Africa, giving this phenomenon the name the \"African enigma\".[109] Although this bacterial species is found in Africa, evidence has supported that different strains with mutations in the bacterial genotype may contribute to the difference in cancer development between African countries and others outside the continent.[109] Increasing access to health care and treatment measures have been commonly associated with the rising incidence, though, particularly in Uganda.[108]\n\n\n\n## Other animals[edit]\n\n\nThe stomach is a muscular organ of the gastrointestinal tract that holds food and begins the digestive process by secreting gastric juice. The most common cancers of the stomach are adenocarcinomas, but other histological types have been reported. Signs vary, but may include vomiting (especially if blood is present), weight loss, anemia, and lack of appetite. Bowel movements may be dark and tarry in nature. To determine whether cancer is present in the stomach, special X-rays and/or abdominal ultrasounds may be performed. Gastroscopy, a test using an endoscope to examine the stomach, is a useful diagnostic tool that can also take samples of the suspected mass for histopathological analysis to confirm or rule out cancer. The most definitive method of cancer diagnosis is through open surgical biopsy.[110] Most stomach tumors are malignant with evidence of spread to lymph nodes or liver, making treatment difficult. Except for lymphoma, surgery is the most frequent treatment option for stomach cancers but it is associated with significant risks.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA carcinogenic interaction was demonstrated between bile acids and *Helicobacter pylori* in a mouse model of gastric cancer.[111][112]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** \"Gastric Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)\". *NCI*. 17 April 2014.

Its histology was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells. Left above: normal, right above: FICE, left low: acetate stained, right low: AIM stained\nStomach cancer is often either asymptomatic (producing no noticeable symptoms) or it may cause only nonspecific symptoms (which may also be present in other related or unrelated disorders) in its early stages. By the time symptoms are recognized, the cancer has often reached an advanced stage (see below) and may have metastasized (spread to other, perhaps distant, parts of the body), which is one of the main reasons for its relatively poor prognosis.[22] Stomach cancer can cause the following signs and symptoms: Unexplained nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation. Patients also can experience unexplained weight loss.[23]\n\n\nEarly cancers may be associated with indigestion or a burning sensation (heartburn). However, fewer than one in every 50 people referred for endoscopy due to indigestion has cancer.[24] Abdominal discomfort and loss of appetite, especially for meat, can occur.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGastric cancers that have enlarged and invaded normal tissue can cause weakness, fatigue, bloating of the stomach after meals, abdominal pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and occasional vomiting. Further enlargement may cause weight loss or bleeding with vomiting blood or having blood in the stool, the latter apparent as black discolouration (melena) and sometimes leading to anemia. Dysphagia suggests a tumour in the cardia or extension of the gastric tumour into the esophagus.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThese can be symptoms of other problems such as a stomach virus, gastric ulcer, or tropical sprue.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Risk factors[edit]\n\n\nGastric cancer can occur as a result of many factors.[25] It occurs twice as commonly in males as females. Estrogen may protect women against the development of this form of cancer.[26][27]\n\n\n\n### Infections[edit]\n\n\n*Helicobacter pylori* infection is an essential risk factor in 65–80% of gastric cancers, but only 2% of people with *H. pylori* infections develop stomach cancer.[4][28] The mechanism by which *H. pylori* induces stomach cancer potentially involves chronic inflammation, the action of *H. pylori* virulence factors such as CagA,[29] or an interaction between *H. pylori* infection and germline pathogenic variants in homologous-recombination genes.[30] It was estimated that Epstein–Barr virus is responsible for 84,000 cases per year.[31] AIDS is also associated with elevated risk.[4]\n\n\n\n### Smoking[edit]\n\n\nSmoking increases the risk of developing gastric cancer significantly, from 40% increased risk for current smokers to 82% increase for heavy smokers. Gastric cancers due to smoking mostly occur in the upper part of the stomach near the esophagus.[32][33][34]\n\n\n\n### Alcohol[edit]\n\n\nSome studies show increased risk with alcohol consumption as well.[4][35]\n\n\n\n### Diet[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sequence of 123-iodine human scintiscans after an intravenous injection: (from left) after 30 minutes, 20 hours, and 48 hours - a high and rapid concentration of radio-iodine is evident in gastric mucosa of the stomach, in salivary glands, oral mucosa, and the periencephalic and cerebrospinal fluid (left). In the thyroid gland, I-concentration is more progressive, also in the reservoir (from 1% after 30 minutes to 5.8% after 48 hours, of the total injected dose).[36]\nDietary factors are not proven causes, and the association between stomach cancer and various foods and beverages is weak.[37] Some foods including smoked foods, salt and salt-rich foods, red meat, processed meat, pickled vegetables, and brackens are associated with a higher risk of stomach cancer.[4][38][39] Nitrates and nitrites in cured meats can be converted by certain bacteria, including *H. pylori*, into compounds that have been found to cause stomach cancer in animals.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFresh fruit and vegetable intake, citrus fruit intake, and antioxidant intake are associated with a lower risk of stomach cancer.[4][32] A Mediterranean diet is associated with lower rates of stomach cancer,[40] as is regular aspirin use.[4]\n\n\nObesity is a physical risk factor that has been found to increase the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma by contributing to the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).[41] The exact mechanism by which obesity causes GERD is not completely known. Studies hypothesize that increased dietary fat leading to increased pressure on the stomach and the lower esophageal sphincter, due to excess adipose tissue, could play a role, yet no statistically significant data have been collected.[42] However, the risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, with GERD present, has been found to increase more than 2 times for an obese person.[41] There is a correlation between iodine deficiency and gastric cancer.[43][44][45]\n\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nAbout 10% of cases run in families, and between 1 and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.[2]\n\n\nA genetic risk factor for gastric cancer is a genetic defect of the *CDH1* gene known as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). The *CDH1* gene, which codes for E-cadherin, lies on the 16th chromosome.[46] When the gene experiences a particular mutation, gastric cancer develops through a mechanism that is not fully understood.[46][47] This mutation is considered autosomal dominant, meaning that half of a carrier's children will likely experience the same mutation.[46] Diagnosis of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer usually takes place when at least two cases involving a family member, such as a parent or grandparent, are diagnosed, with at least one diagnosed before the age of 50.[46] The diagnosis can also be made if at least three cases occur in the family, in which case age is not considered.[46]\n\n\nThe International Cancer Genome Consortium is leading efforts to identify genomic changes involved in stomach cancer.[48][49] A very small percentage of diffuse-type gastric cancers (see Histopathology below) arise from an inherited abnormal *CDH1* gene. Genetic testing and treatment options are available for families at risk.[50]\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nOther risk factors include diabetes,[51] pernicious anemia,[35] chronic atrophic gastritis,[52] Menetrier's disease (hyperplastic, hypersecretory gastropathy),[53] and intestinal metaplasia.[54]\n\n\nIn addition, Foxp3 polymorphism (rs3761548) might contribute to gastric cancer development through influencing Treg cell activity.[55]\n\n\nIn a human retrospective study, biliary reflux was found to be a likely risk factor for gastric cancer and precancerous lesions.[56]\n\n\n\n## Diagnosis[edit]\n\n\nTo find the cause of symptoms, the doctor asks about the patient's medical history, does a physical examination, and may order laboratory studies.[57]\nThe patient may also have one or all of these exams:\n\n\n\n* Gastroscopic exam is the diagnostic method of choice. This involves insertion of a fibre optic camera into the stomach to visualise it.[35]\n* Upper GI series (may be called barium roentgenogram)\n* Computed tomography or CT scanning of the abdomen may reveal gastric cancer. It is more useful to determine invasion into adjacent tissues or the presence of spread to local lymph nodes. Wall thickening of more than 1 cm that is focal, eccentric, and enhancing favours malignancy.[58]\n\n\nIn 2013, Chinese and Israeli scientists reported a successful pilot study of a breathalyzer-style breath test intended to diagnose stomach cancer by analyzing exhaled chemicals without the need for an intrusive endoscopy.[59][60] A larger-scale clinical trial of this technology was completed in 2014.[61][62]\n\n\nAbnormal tissue seen in a gastroscope examination is biopsied by the surgeon or gastroenterologist. This tissue is then sent to a pathologist for histological examination under a microscope to check for the presence of cancerous cells. A biopsy, with subsequent histological analysis, is the only sure way to confirm the presence of cancer cells.[35]\n\n\nVarious gastroscopic modalities have been developed to increase yield of detected mucosa with a dye that accentuates the cell structure and can identify areas of dysplasia. Endocytoscopy involves ultra-high magnification to visualise cellular structure to better determine areas of dysplasia. Other gastroscopic modalities such as optical coherence tomography are being tested investigationally for similar applications.[63]\n\n\nA number of cutaneous conditions are associated with gastric cancer. A condition of darkened hyperplasia of the skin, frequently of the axilla and groin, known as acanthosis nigricans, is associated with intra-abdominal cancers such as gastric cancer. Other cutaneous manifestations of gastric cancer include \"tripe palms\" (a similar darkening hyperplasia of the skin of the palms) and the Leser-Trelat sign, which is the rapid development of skin lesions known as seborrheic keratoses.[64]\n\n\nVarious blood tests may be done, including a complete blood count to check for anaemia, and a fecal occult blood test to check for blood in the stool.[65]\n\n\n\n### Histopathology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stomach cancer types by relative incidence[66]\n* *Gastric adenocarcinoma* is a malignant epithelial tumour, originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Stomach cancers are about 90% adenocarcinomas.[67] Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa and then the muscularis propria. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumour cells describe irregular tubular structures, harbouring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (\"back to back\" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighbouring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiated. Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica or leather-bottle stomach) tumour cells are discohesive and secrete mucus, which is delivered in the interstitium, producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically \"empty\" spaces). It is poorly differentiated. In signet-ring cell carcinomas, the mucus remains inside the tumour cell and pushes the nucleus to the periphery, giving rise to signet-ring cells.[*citation needed*]\n* Around 5% of gastric cancers are lymphomas.[68] These may include extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MALT type)[69] and to a lesser extent diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.[70] MALT type make up about half of stomach lymphomas.[16]\n* Carcinoid and stromal tumors may occur.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n* ![Poor to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach.

H&E stain.\n\n\n### Staging[edit]\n\n\n![](image)T stages of stomach cancer\nIf cancer cells are found in the tissue sample, the next step is to stage, or find out the extent of the disease. Various tests determine whether the cancer has spread, and if so, what parts of the body are affected. Because stomach cancer can spread to the liver, pancreas, and other organs near the stomach, as well as to the lungs, the doctor may order a CT scan, a PET scan,[71] an endoscopic ultrasound exam, or other tests to check these areas. Blood tests for tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen may be ordered, as their levels correlate to extent of metastasis, especially to the liver, and the cure rate.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nStaging may not be complete until after surgery. The surgeon removes nearby lymph nodes and possibly samples of tissue from other areas in the abdomen for examination by a pathologist.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe clinical stages of stomach cancer are:[72][73]\n\n\n\n* **Stage 0** – Limited to the inner lining of the stomach, it is treatable by endoscopic mucosal resection when found very early (in routine screenings), or otherwise by gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy without need for chemotherapy or radiation.\n* **Stage I** – Penetration to the second or third layers of the stomach (stage 1A) or to the second layer and nearby lymph nodes (stage 1B): Stage 1A is treated by surgery, including removal of the omentum. Stage 1B may be treated with chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil) and radiation therapy.\n* **Stage II** – Penetration to the second layer and more distant lymph nodes, or the third layer and only nearby lymph nodes, or all four layers but not the lymph nodes, it is treated as for stage I, sometimes with additional neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n* **Stage III** – Penetration to the third layer and more distant lymph nodes, or penetration to the fourth layer and either nearby tissues or nearby or more distant lymph nodes, it is treated as for stage II; a cure is still possible in some cases.\n* **Stage IV** – Cancer has spread to nearby tissues and more distant lymph nodes, or has metastasized to other organs. A cure is very rarely possible at this stage. Some other techniques to prolong life or improve symptoms are used, including laser treatment, surgery, and/or stents to keep the digestive tract open, and chemotherapy by drugs such as 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, epirubicin, etoposide, docetaxel, oxaliplatin, capecitabine, or irinotecan.[14]\n\n\n![](image)Stomach cancer metastasized to the lungs\nThe TNM staging system is also used.[74]\n\n\nIn a study of open-access endoscopy in Scotland, patients were diagnosed 7% in stage I, 17% in stage II, and 28% in stage III.[75] A Minnesota population was diagnosed 10% in stage I, 13% in stage II, and 18% in stage III.[76] However, in a high-risk population in the Valdivia Province of southern Chile, only 5% of patients were diagnosed in the first two stages and 10% in stage III.[77]\n\n\n\n## Prevention[edit]\n\n\nGetting rid of *H. pylori* in those who are infected decreases the risk of stomach cancer.[78] A 2014 meta-analysis of observational studies found that a diet high in fruits, mushrooms, garlic, soybeans, and green onions was associated with a lower risk of stomach cancer in the Korean population.[79] Low doses of vitamins, especially from a healthy diet, decrease the risk of stomach cancer.[80] A previous review of antioxidant supplementation did not find supporting evidence and possibly worse outcomes.[81][82] Modern technology is used to promote early diagnosis, e.g. based on serum markers.[83]\n\n\n\n## Management[edit]\n\n\nCancer of the stomach is difficult to cure unless it is found at an early stage (before it has begun to spread). Unfortunately, because early stomach cancer causes few symptoms, the disease is usually advanced when the diagnosis is made.[84]\n\n\nTreatment for stomach cancer may include surgery,[85] chemotherapy,[14] or radiation therapy.[86] New treatment approaches such as immunotherapy or gene therapy and improved ways of using current methods are being studied in clinical trials.[87]\n\n\n\n### Surgery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anatomy before Roux-en-y surgery to resect stomach cancer\nSurgery remains the only curative therapy for stomach cancer.[6] Of the different surgical techniques, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a treatment for early gastric cancer (tumor only involves the mucosa) that was pioneered in Japan and is available in the United States at some centers.[6] In EMR, the tumor, together with the inner lining of stomach (mucosa), is removed from the wall of the stomach using an electrical wire loop through the endoscope. The advantage is that it is a much smaller operation than removing the stomach.[6] Endoscopic submucosal dissection is a similar technique pioneered in Japan, used to resect a large area of mucosa in one piece.[6] If the pathologic examination of the resected specimen shows incomplete resection or deep invasion by tumor, the patient would need a formal stomach resection.[6] A 2016 Cochrane review found low-quality evidence of no difference in short-term mortality between laparoscopic and open gastrectomy (removal of stomach), and that benefits or harms of laparoscopic gastrectomy cannot be ruled out.[88] Post-operatively, up to 70% of people undergoing total gastrectomy develop complications such as dumping syndrome and reflux esophagitis.[89] Construction of a \"pouch\", which serves as a \"stomach substitute\", reduced the incidence of dumping syndrome and reflux esophagitis by 73% and 63% respectively, and led to improvements in quality-of-life, nutritional outcomes, and body mass index.[89]\n\n\nThose with metastatic disease at the time of presentation may receive palliative surgery, and while it remains controversial, due to the possibility of complications from the surgery itself and because it may delay chemotherapy, the data so far are mostly positive, with improved survival rates being seen in those treated with this approach.[6][90]\n\n\n\n### Chemotherapy[edit]\n\n\nThe use of chemotherapy to treat stomach cancer has no firmly established standard of care.[14] Unfortunately, stomach cancer has not been particularly sensitive to these drugs, and chemotherapy, if used, has usually served to palliatively reduce the size of the tumor, relieve symptoms of the disease, and increase survival time.[14] Some drugs used in stomach cancer treatment have included: fluorouracil or its analog capecitabine, BCNU (carmustine), methyl-CCNU (semustine) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin), as well as mitomycin C, and more recently cisplatin and taxotere, often using drugs in various combinations.[14] The relative benefits of these different drugs, alone and in combination, are unclear.[14][91] Clinical researchers are exploring the benefits of giving chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the tumor, or as adjuvant therapy after surgery to destroy remaining cancer cells.[6]\n\n\n\n### Targeted therapy[edit]\n\n\nRecently[*when?*], treatment with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (*HER2*) inhibitor, trastuzumab, has been demonstrated to increase overall survival in inoperable locally advanced or metastatic gastric carcinoma over-expressing the *HER2/neu* gene.[6] In particular, *HER2* is overexpressed in 13–22% of patients with gastric cancer.[87][92] Of note, *HER2* overexpression in gastric neoplasia is heterogeneous and comprises a minority of tumor cells (less than 10% of gastric cancers overexpress *HER2* in more than 5% of tumor cells). Hence, this heterogeneous expression should be taken into account for *HER2* testing, particularly in small samples such as biopsies, requiring the evaluation of more than one bioptic sample.[92]\n\n\n\n### Radiation[edit]\n\n\nRadiation therapy (also called radiotherapy) may be used to treat stomach cancer, often as an adjuvant to chemotherapy and/or surgery.[6]\n\n\n\n### Lymphoma[edit]\n\n\nMALT lymphomas are often completely resolved after the underlying *H. pylori* infection is treated.[16] This results in remission in about 80% of cases.[16]\n\n\n\n## Prognosis[edit]\n\n\nThe prognosis of stomach cancer is generally poor, because the tumor has often metastasized by the time of discovery, and most people with the condition are elderly (median age is between 70 and 75 years) at presentation.[93] The average life expectancy after being diagnosed is around 24 months, and the five-year survival rate for stomach cancer is less than 10%.[6]\n\n\nAlmost 300 genes are related to outcomes in stomach cancer, with both unfavorable genes where high expression is related to poor survival and favorable genes where high expression is associated with longer survival times.[94][95] Examples of poor prognosis genes include ITGAV, DUSP1 and P2RX7.[96]\n\n\n\n## Epidemiology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stomach cancer deaths per million persons in 2012 0–11\n12–16\n17–24\n25–33\n34–51\n52–76\n77–102\n103–128\n129–175\n176–400\n\nIn 2018, stomach cancer was the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide, representing 5.7% of all cancer cases, and the third leading cause of death from cancers, being responsible for 8.2% of all cancer deaths.[97] Among men, 683 754 cases were diagnosed, accounting for 7.2% of all cancer cases, and among women, stomach cancer was diagnosed in 349 947 cases, accounting for 4.1% of all cancer cases.[97]\n\n\nIn 2012, stomach cancer was the fifth most-common cancer with 952,000 cases diagnosed.[17] It is more common both in men and in developing countries.[98][99] In 2012, it represented 8.5% of cancer cases in men, making it the fourth-most common cancer in men.[100] Also in 2012, the number of deaths was 700,000, having decreased slightly from 774,000 in 1990, making it the third-leading cause of cancer-related death (after lung cancer and liver cancer).[101][102]\n\n\nLess than 5% of stomach cancers occur in people under 40 years of age, with 81.1% of that 5% in the age-group of 30 to 39 and 18.9% in the age-group of 20 to 29.[103]\n\n\nIn 2014, stomach cancer resulted in 0.61% of deaths (13,303 cases) in the U.S.[104] In China, stomach cancer accounted for 3.56% of all deaths (324,439 cases).[105][*unreliable source?*] The highest rate of stomach cancer was in Mongolia, at 28 cases per 100,000 people.[106][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, stomach cancer is the 15th-most common cancer (around 7,100 people were diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2011), and it is the 10th-most common cause of cancer-related deaths (around 4,800 people died in 2012).[107]\n\n\nIncidence and mortality rates of gastric cancer vary greatly in Africa. The GLOBOCAN system is currently the most widely used method to compare these rates between countries, but African incidence and mortality rates are seen to differ among countries, possibly due to the lack of universal access to a registry system for all countries.[108] Variation as drastic as estimated rates from 0.3/100000 in Botswana to 20.3/100000 in Mali have been observed.[108] In Uganda, the incidence of gastric cancer has increased from the 1960s measurement of 0.8/100000 to 5.6/100000.[108] Gastric cancer, though present, is relatively low when compared to countries with high incidence like Japan and China. One suspected cause of the variation within Africa and between other countries is due to different strains of the *H. pylori* bacteria. The trend commonly seen is that *H. pylori* infection increases the risk for gastric cancer, but this is not the case in Africa, giving this phenomenon the name the \"African enigma\".[109] Although this bacterial species is found in Africa, evidence has supported that different strains with mutations in the bacterial genotype may contribute to the difference in cancer development between African countries and others outside the continent.[109] Increasing access to health care and treatment measures have been commonly associated with the rising incidence, though, particularly in Uganda.[108]\n\n\n\n## Other animals[edit]\n\n\nThe stomach is a muscular organ of the gastrointestinal tract that holds food and begins the digestive process by secreting gastric juice. The most common cancers of the stomach are adenocarcinomas, but other histological types have been reported. Signs vary, but may include vomiting (especially if blood is present), weight loss, anemia, and lack of appetite. Bowel movements may be dark and tarry in nature. To determine whether cancer is present in the stomach, special X-rays and/or abdominal ultrasounds may be performed. Gastroscopy, a test using an endoscope to examine the stomach, is a useful diagnostic tool that can also take samples of the suspected mass for histopathological analysis to confirm or rule out cancer. The most definitive method of cancer diagnosis is through open surgical biopsy.[110] Most stomach tumors are malignant with evidence of spread to lymph nodes or liver, making treatment difficult. Except for lymphoma, surgery is the most frequent treatment option for stomach cancers but it is associated with significant risks.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA carcinogenic interaction was demonstrated between bile acids and *Helicobacter pylori* in a mouse model of gastric cancer.[111][112]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** \"Gastric Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)\". *NCI*. 17 April 2014.
