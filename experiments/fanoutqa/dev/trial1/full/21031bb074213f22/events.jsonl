It has been referred to as \"the most powerful company in the world\"[10] and as one of the world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in the field of artificial intelligence.[11][12][13] Alongside Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta, and Microsoft, Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. is one of the five Big Tech companies.\n\n\nGoogle was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14]\n\n\nThe company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail), navigation (Waze & Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web browsing (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), video calling (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch & Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), artificial intelligence (Google Assistant & Bard), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.[15][16]\n\n\nGoogle's other ventures outside of Internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project), smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google Deepmind).[17]\n\n\nGoogle and YouTube are the two most visited websites worldwide followed by Facebook and X (formerly known as Twitter). Google is also the largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider, office suite, video sharing platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser, ML framework, and AI virtual assistant provider in the world as measured by market share. On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by Forbes[18] and fourth by Interbrand.[19] It has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and abuse of its monopoly position.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Google and List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet\n\nSee also: Alphabet Inc.\n\n### Early years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2003\nGoogle began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California.[20][21][22] The project initially involved an unofficial \"third founder\", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;[23][24] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.[25][26]\n\n\nWhile conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[27] They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[28][29] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.[23]\n\n\nPage and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine \"BackRub\", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.[20][30][31] Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-Molina and Jeff Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project.[32] PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu.[33][34]\n\n\nEventually, they changed the name to *Google*; the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the word *googol*,[20][35][36] a very large number written **10100** (1 followed by 100 zeros), picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[37]\n\n\n\n![Google's homepage in 1998](image)Google's original homepage had a simple design because the company founders had little experience in HTML, the markup language used for designing web pages.[38]\nGoogle was initially funded by an August 1998 investment of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim,[20] co-founder of Sun Microsystems. This initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company to be able to use the funds.[39][40] Page and Brin initially approached David Cheriton for advice because he had a nearby office in Stanford, and they knew he had startup experience, having recently sold the company he co-founded, Granite Systems, to Cisco for $220 million. David arranged a meeting with Page and Brin and his Granite co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The meeting was set for 8 a.m. at the front porch of David's home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another meeting at Cisco, where he now worked after the acquisition, at 9 a.m. Andy briefly tested a demo of the website, liked what he saw, and then went back to his car to grab the check. David Cheriton later also joined in with a $250,000 investment.[41][42]\n\n\nGoogle received money from two other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and entrepreneur Ram Shriram.[43] Page and Brin had first approached Shriram, who was a venture capitalist, for funding and counsel, and Shriram invested $250,000 in Google in February 1998. Shriram knew Bezos because Amazon had acquired Junglee, at which Shriram was the president. It was Shriram who told Bezos about Google. Bezos asked Shriram to meet Google's founders and they met six months after Shriram had made his investment when Bezos and his wife were on a vacation trip to the Bay Area. Google's initial funding round had already formally closed but Bezos' status as CEO of Amazon was enough to persuade Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment.[44][45]\n\n\nBetween these initial investors, friends, and family Google raised around $1,000,000, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California.[46]\nCraig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.[22][47][48]\n\n\nAfter some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[43] a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[49] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital.[40] Both firms were initially reticent about investing jointly in Google, as each wanted to retain a larger percentage of control over the company to themselves. Larry and Sergey however insisted in taking investments from both. Both venture companies finally agreed to investing jointly $12.5 million each due to their belief in Google's great potential and through the mediation of earlier angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram who had contacts in the venture companies.[50]\n\n\n\n### Growth[edit]\n\n\nIn March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California,[51] which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.[52] The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.[53][22] To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.[54] In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.[55][56]\n\n\n\n![Google's first servers, showing lots of exposed wiring and circuit boards](image)Google's first production server[57]\nIn 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California.[58] The complex became known as the Googleplex, a play on the word googolplex, the number one followed by a googol of zeroes. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million.[59] By that time, the name \"Google\" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb \"google\" to be added to the *Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary* and the *Oxford English Dictionary*, denoted as: \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet\".[60][61] The first use of the verb on television appeared in an October 2002 episode of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*.[62]\n\n\nAdditionally, in 2001 Google's investors felt the need to have a strong internal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the chairman and CEO of Google.[46] Eric was proposed by John Doerr from Kleiner Perkins. He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey and Larry would accept for several months, but they rejected several candidates because they wanted to retain control over the company. Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital at one point even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay back Sequoia's $12.5m investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer, which had been made verbally during investment negotiations. Eric was not initially enthusiastic about joining Google either, as the company's full potential had not yet been widely recognized at the time, and as he was occupied with his responsibilities at Novell where he was CEO. As part of him joining, Eric agreed to buy $1 million of Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment and to provide funds Google needed.[63]\n\n\n\n### Initial public offering[edit]\n\n\nOn August 19, 2004, Google became a public company via an initial public offering. At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024.[64] The company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[65][66] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.[67][68] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[69]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011\nOn November 13, 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock,[70][71][72][73] On March 11, 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, transferring to Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies.[74][75]\n\n\nBy 2011, Google was handling approximately 3 billion searches per day. To handle this workload, Google built 11 data centers around the world with several thousand servers in each. These data centers allowed Google to handle the ever-changing workload more efficiently.[46]\n\n\nIn May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time.[76][77]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in its largest acquisition to date.[78][79][80] This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[81] mainly Apple and Microsoft,[82] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android.[83]\n\n\n\n### 2012 onward[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2013, Google acquired Waze, a $966 million deal.[84] While Waze would remain an independent entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable integrations between Waze and Google Maps, Google's own mapping service.[85]\n\n\nGoogle announced the launch of a new company, called Calico, on September 19, 2013, to be led by Apple Inc. chairman Arthur Levinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the \"health and well-being\" company would focus on \"the challenge of ageing and associated diseases\".[86]\n\n\n\n![](image)Entrance of building where Google and its subsidiary Deep Mind are located at 6 Pancras Square, London\nOn January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquire DeepMind Technologies, a privately held artificial intelligence company from London.[87] Technology news website *Recode* reported that the company was purchased for $400 million, yet the source of the information was not disclosed. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the price.[88][89] The purchase of DeepMind aids in Google's recent growth in the artificial intelligence and robotics community.[90]/ In 2015, DeepMind's AlphaGo became the first computer program to defeat a top human pro at the game of Go.\n\n\nAccording to Interbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple Inc.) in 2013,[91] 2014,[92] 2015,[93] and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion.[94]\n\n\nOn August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate named Alphabet Inc. Google became Alphabet's largest subsidiary and the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructuring, Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.[95][96][97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Current Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, with Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi\nOn August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributed a memo throughout the company that argued bias and \"Google's Ideological Echo Chamber\" clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions.[98] Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore of violating company policy by \"advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace\", and he was fired on the same day.[99][100][101]\n\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019, tensions between the company's leadership and its workers escalated as staff protested company decisions on internal sexual harassment, Dragonfly, a censored Chinese search engine, and Project Maven, a military drone artificial intelligence, which had been seen as areas of revenue growth for the company.[102][103] On October 25, 2018, *The New York Times* published the *exposé*, \"How Google Protected Andy Rubin, the 'Father of Android'\". The company subsequently announced that \"48 employees have been fired over the last two years\" for sexual misconduct.[104] On November 1, 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walk-out to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment complaints.[105][106] CEO Sundar Pichai was reported to be in support of the protests.[107] Later in 2019, some workers accused the company of retaliating against internal activists.[103]\n\n\nOn March 19, 2019, Google announced that it would enter the video game market, launching a cloud gaming platform called Google Stadia.[108]\n\n\nOn June 3, 2019, the United States Department of Justice reported that it would investigate Google for antitrust violations.[109] This led to the filing of an antitrust lawsuit in October 2020, on the grounds the company had abused a monopoly position in the search and search advertising markets.[110]\n\n\nIn December 2019, former PayPal chief operating officer Bill Ready became Google's new commerce chief. Ready's role will not be directly involved with Google Pay.[111]\n\n\nIn April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Google announced several cost-cutting measures. Such measures included slowing down hiring for the remainder of 2020, except for a small number of strategic areas, recalibrating the focus and pace of investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non-business essential marketing and travel.[112] Most employees were also working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the success of it even led to Google announcing that they would be permanently converting some of their jobs to work from home [113]\n\n\nThe 2020 Google services outages disrupted Google services: one in August that affected Google Drive among others, another in November affecting YouTube, and a third in December affecting the entire suite of Google applications. All three outages were resolved within hours.[114][115][116]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Alphabet Workers Union was founded, composed mostly of Google employees.[117]\n\n\nIn January 2021, the Australian Government proposed legislation that would require Google and Facebook to pay media companies for the right to use their content. In response, Google threatened to close off access to its search engine in Australia.[118]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Google reportedly paid $20 million for Ubisoft ports on Google Stadia.[119] Google spent \"tens of millions of dollars\" on getting major publishers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two to bring some of their biggest games to Stadia.[120]\n\n\nIn April 2021, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Google ran a years-long program called \"Project Bernanke\" that used data from past advertising bids to gain an advantage over competing for ad services. This was revealed in documents concerning the antitrust lawsuit filed by ten US states against Google in December.[121]\n\n\nIn September 2021, the Australian government announced plans to curb Google's capability to sell targeted ads, claiming that the company has a monopoly on the market harming publishers, advertisers, and consumers.[122]\n\n\nIn 2022, Google began accepting requests for the removal of phone numbers, physical addresses and email addresses from its search results. It had previously accepted requests for removing confidential data only, such as Social Security numbers, bank account and credit card numbers, personal signatures, and medical records. Even with the new policy, Google may remove information from only certain but not all search queries. It would not remove content that is \"broadly useful\", such as news articles, or already part of the public record.[123]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Google announced that the company had acquired California based, MicroLED display technology development and manufacturing Start-up Raxium. Raxium is set to join Google's Devices and Services team to aid in the development of micro-optics, monolithic integration, and system integration.[124][125]\n\n\nIn early 2023, following the success of ChatGPT and concerns that Google was falling behind in the AI race, Google's senior management issued a \"code red\" and a \"directive that all of its most important products—those with more than a billion users—must incorporate generative AI within months\".[126]\n\n\nIn early May 2023, Google announced its plans to build two additional data centers in Ohio. These centers, which will be built in Columbus and Lancaster, will power up the company’s tools, including AI technology. The said data hub will add to the already operational center near Columbus, bringing Google's total investment in Ohio to over $2 billion.[127]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Google products\n\n### Search engine[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Google Search and Google Images\n\nGoogle indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and operators.[128] According to comScore market research from November 2009, Google Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a market share of 65.6%.[129] In May 2017, Google enabled a new \"Personal\" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from Google Photos.[130][131]\n\n\nGoogle launched its Google News service in 2002, an automated service which summarizes news articles from various websites.[132] Google also hosts Google Books, a service which searches the text found in books in its database and shows limited previews or and the full book where allowed.[133]\n\n\nGoogle expanded its search services to include shopping (launched originally as Froogle in 2002),[134] finance (launched 2006),[135] and flights (launched 2011).[136]\n\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Google on ad-tech London, 2010\nGoogle generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on Google and YouTube, Android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. Forty-six percent of this profit was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal methods, namely AdMob, AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.[137]\n\n\nIn addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology its acquisition of DoubleClick, to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history.[138][139]\n\n\nIn 2007, Google launched \"AdSense for Mobile\", taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market.[140]\n\n\nGoogle Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.[141] Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google Ads allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.[142] The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.[143] One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.[144] Google Search Console (rebranded from Google Webmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security issues of their websites, as well as optimize their website's visibility.\n\n\n\n### Consumer services[edit]\n\n\n#### Web-based services[edit]\n\n\nGoogle offers Gmail for email,[145] Google Calendar for time-management and scheduling,[146] Google Maps for mapping, navigation and satellite imagery,[147] Google Drive for cloud storage of files,[148] Google Docs, Sheets and Slides for productivity,[148] Google Photos for photo storage and sharing,[149] Google Keep for note-taking,[150] Google Translate for language translation,[151] YouTube for video viewing and sharing,[152] Google My Business for managing public business information,[153] and Duo for social interaction.[154] In March 2019, Google unveiled a cloud gaming service named Stadia.[108] A job search product has also existed since before 2017,[155][156][157] Google for Jobs is an enhanced search feature that aggregates listings from job boards and career sites.[158]\n\n\nSome Google services are not web-based. Google Earth, launched in 2005, allowed users to see high-definition satellite pictures from all over the world for free through a client software downloaded to their computers.[159]\n\n\n\n#### Software[edit]\n\n\nGoogle develops the Android mobile operating system,[160] as well as its smartwatch,[161] television,[162] car,[163] and Internet of things-enabled smart devices variations.[164]\n\n\nIt also develops the Google Chrome web browser,[165] and ChromeOS, an operating system based on Chrome.[166]\n\n\n\n#### Hardware[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Google Pixel smartphones on display in a store\nIn January 2010, Google released Nexus One, the first Android phone under its own brand.[167] It spawned a number of phones and tablets under the \"Nexus\" branding[168] until its eventual discontinuation in 2016, replaced by a new brand called Pixel.[169]\n\n\nIn 2011, the Chromebook was introduced, which runs on ChromeOS.[170]\n\n\nIn July 2013, Google introduced the Chromecast dongle, which allows users to stream content from their smartphones to televisions.[171][172]\n\n\nIn June 2014, Google announced Google Cardboard, a simple cardboard viewer that lets the user place their smartphone in a special front compartment to view virtual reality (VR) media.[173]\n\n\nOther hardware products include:\n\n\n\n* Nest, a series of voice assistant smart speakers that can answer voice queries, play music, find information from apps (calendar, weather etc.), and control third-party smart home appliances (users can tell it to turn on the lights, for example). The Google Nest line includes the original Google Home[174] (later succeeded by the Nest Audio), the Google Home Mini (later succeeded by the Nest Mini), the Google Home Max, the Google Home Hub (later rebranded as the Nest Hub), and the Nest Hub Max.\n* Nest Wifi (originally Google Wifi), a connected set of Wi-Fi routers to simplify and extend coverage of home Wi-Fi.[175]\n\n\n### Enterprise services[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform\n\nGoogle Workspace (formerly G Suite until October 2020[176]) is a monthly subscription offering for organizations and businesses to get access to a collection of Google's services, including Gmail, Google Drive and Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides, with additional administrative tools, unique domain names, and 24/7 support.[177]\n\n\nOn September 24, 2012,[178] Google launched Google for Entrepreneurs, a largely not-for-profit business incubator providing startups with co-working spaces known as Campuses, with assistance to startup founders that may include workshops, conferences, and mentorships.[179] Presently, there are seven Campus locations: Berlin, London, Madrid, Seoul, São Paulo, Tel Aviv, and Warsaw.\n\n\nOn March 15, 2016, Google announced the introduction of Google Analytics 360 Suite, \"a set of integrated data and marketing analytics products, designed specifically for the needs of enterprise-class marketers\" which can be integrated with BigQuery on the Google Cloud Platform. Among other things, the suite is designed to help \"enterprise class marketers\" \"see the complete customer journey\", generate \"useful insights\", and \"deliver engaging experiences to the right people\".[180] Jack Marshall of *The Wall Street Journal* wrote that the suite competes with existing marketing cloud offerings by companies including Adobe, Oracle, Salesforce, and IBM.[181]\n\n\n\n### Internet services[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2010, Google announced the Google Fiber project, with experimental plans to build an ultra-high-speed broadband network for 50,000 to 500,000 customers in one or more American cities.[182][183] Following Google's corporate restructure to make Alphabet Inc. its parent company, Google Fiber was moved to Alphabet's Access division.[184][185]\n\n\nIn April 2015, Google announced Project Fi, a mobile virtual network operator, that combines Wi-Fi and cellular networks from different telecommunication providers in an effort to enable seamless connectivity and fast Internet signal.[186][187]\n\n\n\n### Financial services[edit]\n\n\nAs a more mature company, Google has made many moves into financial services.\n\n\nIn August 2023, it became the first major tech company to join the OpenWallet Foundation, launched earlier in the year, whose goal was creating open-source software for interoperable digital wallets.[188]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n### Stock price performance and quarterly earnings[edit]\n\n\nGoogle's initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004. At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[65][66] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[69] The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007,[189] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market.[190] The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds.[190] GOOG shares split into GOOG class C shares and GOOGL class A shares.[191] The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google's holding company, since the fourth quarter of 2015.[update][192]\n\n\nIn the third quarter of 2005, Google reported a 700% increase in profit, largely due to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.[193][194][195]\n\n\nFor the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only $112 million in licensing and other revenues.[196] In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its advertising programs.[197]\n\n\nGoogle generated $50 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2012, generating $38 billion the previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, \"We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half.\"[198]\n\n\nGoogle's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.[199] Google's Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users' clicks on advertisements.[200] By January 2014, Google's market capitalization had grown to $397 billion.[201]\n\n\n\n### Tax avoidance strategies[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland § Multinational tax schemes, and Google tax\n\nGoogle uses various tax avoidance strategies. On the list of largest technology companies by revenue, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through Ireland and the Netherlands and then to Bermuda. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in, for instance, the UK is 28 per cent.[202] This reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's transfer pricing practices in 2012.[203]\n\n\nIn 2020, Google said it had overhauled its controversial global tax structure and consolidated all of its intellectual property holdings back to the US.[204]\n\n\nGoogle Vice-president Matt Brittin testified to the Public Accounts Committee of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.[205] In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future.[206] In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax bill.[207]\n\n\nIn 2013, Google ranked 5th in lobbying spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.[208]\n\n\n\n### Corporate identity[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of Google § Name, Google (verb), Google logo, Google Doodle, List of Google April Fools' Day jokes, and List of Google Easter eggs\n\n![](image)Google's logo from 2013 to 2015\nThe name \"Google\" originated from a misspelling of \"googol\",[209][210] which refers to the number represented by a 1 followed by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their original paper on PageRank:[32] \"We chose our system name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100[,] and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines.\" Having found its way increasingly into everyday language, the verb \"google\" was added to the *Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary* and the *Oxford English Dictionary* in 2006, meaning \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.\"[211][212] Google's mission statement, from the outset, was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\",[213] and its unofficial slogan is \"Don't be evil\".[214] In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: \"Do the right thing\".[215] The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet.\n\n\nThe original Google logo was designed by Sergey Brin.[216] Since 1998,[update] Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on their homepage intended to celebrate holidays, events, achievements and people. The first Google Doodle was in honor of the Burning Man Festival of 1998.[217][218] The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000. From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed \"Doodlers\".[219]\n\n\nGoogle has a tradition of creating April Fools' Day jokes. Its first on April 1, 2000, was Google MentalPlex which allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.[220] In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service called TiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of a fiber-optic cable down their toilet.[221]\n\n\nGoogle's services contain easter eggs, such as the Swedish Chef's \"Bork bork bork,\" Pig Latin, \"Hacker\" or leetspeak, Elmer Fudd, Pirate, and Klingon as language selections for its search engine.[222] When searching for the word \"anagram,\" meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google's suggestion feature displays \"Did you mean: nag a ram?\"[223] Since 2019, Google runs free online courses to help engineers learn how to plan and author technical documentation better.[224]\n\n\n\n### Workplace culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Google employees marching in the Pride in London parade in 2016\nOn *Fortune* magazine's list of the best companies to work for, Google ranked first in 2007, 2008 and 2012,[225][226][227] and fourth in 2009 and 2010.[228][229] Google was also nominated in 2010 to be the world's most attractive employer to graduating students in the Universum Communications talent attraction index.[230] Google's corporate philosophy includes principles such as \"you can make money without doing evil,\" \"you can be serious without a suit,\" and \"work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun.\"[231]\n\n\nAs of September 30, 2020,[update] Alphabet Inc. had 132,121 employees,[232] of which more than 100,000 worked for Google.[8] Google's 2020[update] diversity report states that 32 percent of its workforce are women and 68 percent are men, with the ethnicity of its workforce being predominantly white (51.7%) and Asian (41.9%).[233] Within tech roles, 23.6 percent were women; and 26.7 percent of leadership roles were held by women.[234] In addition to its 100,000+ full-time employees, Google used about 121,000 temporary workers and contractors, as of March 2019.[update][8]\n\n\nGoogle's employees are hired based on a hierarchical system. Employees are split into six hierarchies based on experience and can range \"from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and experienced engineers at level six.\"[235] As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them. Some of Google's services, such as Gmail, Google News, Orkut, and AdSense originated from these independent endeavors.[236] In a talk at Stanford University, Marissa Mayer, Google's vice-president of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.[237]\n\n\nIn 2005, articles in *The New York Times*[238] and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy.[239][240][241] In an effort to maintain the company's unique culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer whose purpose was to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on.[242] Google has also faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees.[243][244] In 2013, a class action against several Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged \"no cold call\" agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.[245] In a lawsuit filed January 8, 2018, multiple employees and job applicants alleged Google discriminated against a class defined by their \"conservative political views[,] male gender[,] and/or [...] Caucasian or Asian race\".[246]\n\n\nOn January 25, 2020, the formation of an international workers union of Google employees, Alpha Global, was announced.[247] The coalition is made up of \"13 different unions representing workers in 10 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Switzerland.\"[248] The group is affiliated with UNI Global Union, which represents nearly 20 million international workers from various unions and federations. The formation of the union is in response to persistent allegations of mistreatment of Google employees and a toxic workplace culture.[248][249][246] Google had previously been accused of surveilling and firing employees who were suspected of organizing a workers union.[250] In 2021 court documents revealed that between 2018 and 2020 Google ran an anti-union campaign called Project Vivian to \"convince them (employees) that unions suck\".[251]\n\n\n\n### Office locations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Googleplex\n\n![](image)Google's New York City office building houses its largest advertising sales team.\n![](image)Google's Toronto office\nGoogle's headquarters in Mountain View, California is referred to as \"the Googleplex\", a play on words on the number googolplex and the headquarters itself being a *complex* of buildings. Internationally, Google has over 78 offices in more than 50 countries.[252]\n\n\nIn 2006, Google moved into about 300,000 square feet (27,900 m2) of office space at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. The office was designed and built specially for Google, and houses its largest advertising sales team.[253] In 2010, Google bought the building housing the headquarter, in a deal that valued the property at around $1.9 billion.[254][255] In March 2018, Google's parent company Alphabet bought the nearby Chelsea Market building for $2.4 billion. The sale is touted as one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single building in the history of New York.[256][257][258][259] In November 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its New York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees.[260] The same December, it was announced that a $1 billion, 1,700,000-square-foot (160,000 m2) headquarters for Google would be built in Manhattan's Hudson Square neighborhood.[261][262] Called Google Hudson Square, the new campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York City.[263]\n\n\nBy late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[264] In November 2006, Google opened offices on Carnegie Mellon's campus in Pittsburgh, focusing on shopping-related advertisement coding and smartphone applications and programs.[265][266] Other office locations in the U.S. include Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Boulder, Colorado; Cambridge, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Kirkland, Washington; Birmingham, Michigan; Reston, Virginia, Washington, D.C.,[267] and Madison, Wisconsin.[268]\n\n\n\n![](image)Google's Dublin Ireland office, headquarters of Google Ads for Europe\nIt also has product research and development operations in cities around the world, namely Sydney (birthplace location of Google Maps)[269] and London (part of Android development).[270] In November 2013, Google announced plans for a new London headquarter, a 1 million square foot office able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at the time of the deal's announcement in January,[271] Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to the Camden Council in June 2017.[272][273] In May 2015, Google announced its intention to create its own campus in Hyderabad, India. The new campus, reported to be the company's largest outside the United States, will accommodate 13,000 employees.[274][275]\n\n\nGoogle's Global Offices sum a total of 85 Locations worldwide,[276] with 32 offices in North America, 3 of them in Canada and 29 in United States Territory, California being the state with the most Google's offices with 9 in total including the Googleplex. In the Latin America Region Google counts with 6 offices, in Europe 24 (3 of them in UK), the Asia Pacific region counts with 18 offices principally 4 in India and 3 in China, and the Africa Middle East region counts 5 offices.\n\n\n\n#### North America[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| SN | City | Country or US State\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Ann Arbor | ![](image) Michigan |\n| 2. | Atlanta | ![](image) Georgia |\n| 3. | Austin | ![](image) Texas |\n| 4. | Boulder | ![](image) Colorado |\n| 5. | Boulder – Pearl Place | ![](image) Colorado |\n| 6. | Boulder – Walnut | ![](image) Colorado |\n| 7. | Cambridge | ![](image) Massachusetts |\n| 8. | Chapel Hill | ![](image) North Carolina |\n| 9. | Chicago – Carpenter | ![](image) Illinois |\n| 10. | Chicago – Fulton Market | ![](image) Illinois |\n| 11. | Detroit | ![](image) Michigan |\n| 12. | Irvine | ![](image) California |\n| 13. | Kirkland | ![](image) Washington |\n| 14. | Kitchener | ![](image) Canada |\n| 15. | Los Angeles | ![](image) California |\n| 16. | Madison | ![](image) Wisconsin |\n| 17. | Miami | ![](image) Florida |\n| 18. | Montreal | ![](image) Canada |\n| 19. | Mountain View | ![](image) California |\n| 20. | New York | ![](image) New York |\n| 21. | Pittsburgh | ![](image) Pennsylvania |\n| 22. | Playa Vista | ![](image) California |\n| 23. | Portland | ![](image) Oregon |\n| 24. | Redwood City | ![](image) California |\n| 25. | Reston | ![](image) Virginia |\n| 26. | San Bruno | ![](image) California |\n| 27. | San Diego | ![](image) California |\n| 28. | San Francisco – **HQ** | ![](image) California |\n| 29. | Seattle | ![](image) Washington |\n| 30. | Sunnyvale | ![](image) California |\n| 31. | Toronto | ![](image) Canada |\n| 32. | Washington DC | ![](image) District of Columbia |\n\n\n#### Latin America[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| SN | City | Country\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Belo Horizonte | ![](image) Brazil |\n| 2. | Bogotá | ![](image) Colombia |\n| 3. | Buenos Aires | ![](image) Argentina |\n| 4. | Mexico City | ![](image) Mexico |\n| 5. | Santiago de Chile | ![](image) Chile |\n| 6. | São Paulo | ![](image) Brazil |\n\n\n#### Europe[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| SN | City | Country\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Aarhus | ![](image) Denmark |\n| 2. | Amsterdam | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| 3. | Athens | ![](image) Greece |\n| 4. | Berlin | ![](image) Germany |\n| 5. | Brussels | ![](image) Belgium |\n| 6. | Copenhagen | ![](image) Denmark |\n| 7. | Dublin | ![](image) Ireland |\n| 8. | Hamburg | ![](image) Germany |\n| 9. | Lisbon | ![](image) Portugal |\n| 10. | London – 6PS | ![](image) United Kingdom |\n| 11. | London – BEL | ![](image) United Kingdom |\n| 12. | London – CSG | ![](image) United Kingdom |\n| 13. | Madrid | ![](image) Spain |\n| 14. | Milan | ![](image) Italy |\n| 15. | Moscow | ![](image) Russia |\n| 16. | Munich | ![](image) Germany |\n| 17. | Oslo | ![](image) Norway |\n| 18. | Paris | ![](image) France |\n| 19. | Prague | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| 20. | Stockholm | ![](image) Sweden |\n| 21. | Vienna | ![](image) Austria |\n| 22. | Warsaw | ![](image) Poland |\n| 23. | Wroclaw | ![](image) Poland |\n| 24. | Zurich – BRA | ![](image) Switzerland |\n| 25. | Zurich – EUR | ![](image) Switzerland |\n\n\n#### Asia-Pacific[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| SN | City | Country\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Auckland | ![](image) New Zealand |\n| 2. | Bangalore | ![](image) India |\n| 3. | Bangkok | ![](image) Thailand |\n| 4. | Beijing | ![](image) China |\n| 5. | Guangzhou | ![](image) China |\n| 6. | Gurgaon | ![](image) India |\n| 7. | Hong Kong | ![](image) Hong Kong |\n| 8. | Hyderabad | ![](image) India |\n| 9. | Jakarta | ![](image) Indonesia |\n| 10. | Kuala Lumpur | ![](image) Malaysia |\n| 11. | Manila | ![](image) Philippines |\n| 12. | Melbourne | ![](image) Australia |\n| 13. | Mumbai | ![](image) India |\n| 14. | Seoul | ![](image) South Korea |\n| 15. | Shanghai | ![](image) China |\n| 16. | Singapore | ![](image) Singapore |\n| 17. | Sydney | ![](image) Australia |\n| 18. | Taipei | ![](image) Taiwan |\n| 19. | Tokyo – RPG | ![](image) Japan |\n| 20. | Tokyo – STRM | ![](image) Japan |\n\n\n#### Africa and the Middle East[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| SN | City | Country\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Dubai | ![](image) United Arab Emirates |\n| 2. | Haifa | ![](image) Israel |\n| 3. | Istanbul | ![](image) Turkey |\n| 4. | Johannesburg | ![](image) South Africa |\n| 5. | Tel Aviv | ![](image) Israel |\n\n\n### Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Google data centers\n\nGoogle has data centers in North and South America, Asia, and Europe.[277] There is no official data on the number of servers in Google data centers; however, research and advisory firm Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers.[278] Traditionally, Google relied on parallel computing on commodity hardware like mainstream x86 computers (similar to home PCs) to keep costs per query low.[279][280][281] In 2005, it started developing its own designs, which were only revealed in 2009.[281]\n\n\nGoogle has built its own private submarine communications cables. The first cable, named Curie, connects California with Chile and was completed on November 15, 2019.[282][283] The second fully Google-owned undersea cable, named Dunant, connects the United States with France and is planned to begin operation in 2020.[284] Google's third subsea cable, Equiano, will connect Lisbon, Portugal with Lagos, Nigeria and Cape Town, South Africa.[285] The company's fourth cable, named Grace Hopper, connects landing points in New York, US, Bude, UK and Bilbao, Spain, and is expected to become operational in 2022.[286]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of solar panels to provide up to 1.6 Megawatt of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus' energy needs.[287][288] The system is the largest rooftop photovoltaic power station constructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one of the largest on any corporate site in the world.[287] Since 2007,[update] Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations.[289]\n\n\nGoogle disclosed in September 2011 that it \"continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes\", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.[290]\n\n\nIn 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable energy project, putting $38.8 million into two wind farms in North Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes.[291] In February 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.[292] The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.[293]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of power for 20 years.[294]\n\n\nIn December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it would purchase enough renewable energy to match 100% of the energy usage of its data centers and offices. The commitment will make Google \"the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy\".[295][296][297]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach 100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma.[298] In September 2019, Google's chief executive announced plans for a $2 billion wind and solar investment, the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. This will grow their green energy profile by 40%, giving them an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean energy, the company said.[299]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Google announced it had retroactively offset all of its carbon emissions since the company's foundation in 1998.[300] It also committed to operating its data centers and offices using only carbon-free energy by 2030.[301] In October 2020, the company pledged to make the packaging for its hardware products 100% plastic-free and 100% recyclable by 2025. It also said that all its final assembly manufacturing sites will achieve a UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill certification by 2022 by ensuring that the vast majority of waste from the manufacturing process is recycled instead of ending up in a landfill.[302]\n\n\n\n#### Climate change denial and misinformation[edit]\n\n\nGoogle donates to climate change denial political groups including the State Policy Network and the Competitive Enterprise Institute.[303][304] The company also actively funds and profits from climate disinformation by monetizing ad spaces on most of the largest climate disinformation sites.[305] Google continued to monetize and profit from sites propagating climate disinformation even after the company updated their policy to prohibit placing their ads on similar sites.[306]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Google.org\n\nIn 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic Google.org, with a start-up fund of $1 billion.[307] The mission of the organization is to create awareness about climate change, global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired Larry Brilliant as the program's executive director in 2004[308] and Megan Smith has since[update] replaced him as director.[309]\n\n\nIn March 2007, in partnership with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), Google hosted the first Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at its headquarters in Mountain View.[310] In 2011, Google donated 1 million euros to International Mathematical Olympiad to support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).[311][312] In July 2012, Google launched a \"Legalize Love\" campaign in support of gay rights.[313]\n\n\nIn 2008, Google announced its \"project 10100\" which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.[314] After two years of silence, during which many wondered what had happened to the program,[315] Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.[316]\n\n\nResponding to the humanitarian crisis after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Google announced a $15 million donation to support Ukrainian citizens.[317] The company also decided to transform its office in Warsaw into a help center for refugees.[318]\n\n\nAlso in February 2022, Google announced a $100 million fund to expand skills training and job placement for low-income Americans, in conjunction with non-profits Year Up, Social Finance, and Merit America.[319]\n\n\n\n## Criticism and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Criticism of Google, Censorship by Google, and Privacy concerns regarding Google\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of Criticism of Google.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this article's main text. *(April 2019)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)San Francisco activists protest privately owned shuttle buses that transport workers for tech companies such as Google from their homes in San Francisco and Oakland to corporate campuses in Silicon Valley.\nGoogle has had criticism over issues such as aggressive tax avoidance,[320] search neutrality, copyright, censorship of search results and content,[321] and privacy.[322][323]\n\n\nOther criticisms are alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of other people's intellectual property, concerns that its compilation of data may violate people's privacy, and the energy consumption of its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such as monopoly, restraint of trade, anti-competitive practices, and patent infringement.\n\n\nGoogle formerly complied with Internet censorship policies of the People's Republic of China,[324] enforced by means of filters colloquially known as \"The Great Firewall of China\", but no longer does so. As a result, all Google services except for Chinese Google Maps are blocked from access within mainland China without the aid of virtual private networks, proxy servers, or other similar technologies.\n\n\n\n### 2018[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Mozilla program manager Chris Peterson accused Google of intentionally slowing down YouTube performance on Firefox.[325][326]\n\n\nIn August 2018, The Intercept reported that Google is developing for the People's Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as Dragonfly) \"that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest\".[327][328] However, the project had been withheld due to privacy concerns.[329][330]\n\n\n\n### 2019[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, a hub for critics of Google dedicated to abstaining from using Google products coalesced in the Reddit online community /r/degoogle.[331] The DeGoogle grassroots campaign continues to grow as privacy activists highlight information about Google products, and the associated incursion on personal privacy rights by the company.\n\n\nIn April 2019, former Mozilla executive Jonathan Nightingale accused Google of intentionally and systematically sabotaging the Firefox browser over the past decade in order to boost adoption of Google Chrome.[332]\n\n\nIn November 2019, the Office for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human Services began investigation into Project Nightingale, to assess whether the \"mass collection of individuals' medical records\" complied with HIPAA.[333] According to *The Wall Street Journal*, Google secretively began the project in 2018, with St. Louis-based healthcare company Ascension.[334]\n\n\n\n### 2022[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2022 National Labor Relations Board ruling, court documents suggested that Google sponsored a secretive project—*Project Vivian*—to counsel its employees and to discourage them from forming unions.[335]\n\n\n\n### 2023[edit]\n\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Google placed an ad against anti-disinformation Brazilian Congressional Bill No. 2630, which was about to be approved, on its search homepage in Brazil, calling on its users to ask congressional representatives to oppose the legislation. The country's government and judiciary accused the company of undue interference in the congressional debate, saying it could amount to abuse of economic power and ordering the company to change the ad within two hours of notification or face fines of R$1 million (2023) (US$185,528.76) per non-compliance hour. The company then promptly removed the ad.[336][337]\n\n\n\n### Racially-targeted surveillance[edit]\n\n\nGoogle has aided controversial governments in mass surveillance projects, sharing with police and military the identities of those protesting racial injustice. In 2020, they shared with the FBI information collected from all Android users at a Black Lives Matter protest in Seattle,[338] including those who had opted out of location data collection.[339][340]\n\n\nGoogle is also part of Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion deal in which the technology companies Google and Amazon will provide Israel and its military with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other cloud computing services, including building local cloud sites that will \"keep information within Israel's borders under strict security guidelines.\"[341][342][343] The contract has been criticized by shareholders as well as their employees over concerns that the project will lead to further abuses of Palestinians' human rights in the context of the ongoing illegal occupation and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[344][345] Ariel Koren, a former marketing manager for Google's educational products and an outspoken critic of the project, wrote that Google \"systematically silences Palestinian, Jewish, Arab and Muslim voices concerned about Google's complicity in violations of Palestinian human rights—to the point of formally retaliating against workers and creating an environment of fear,\" reflecting her view that the ultimatum came in retaliation for her opposition to and organization against the project.[341][346]\n\n\n\n### Anti-trust, privacy, and other litigation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Google litigation\n\n![](image)The European Commission, which imposed three fines on Google in 2017, 2018, and 2019\n#### Fines and lawsuits[edit]\n\n\n##### European Union[edit]\n\n\nOn June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of €2.42 billion from the European Union for \"promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results.\"[347]\n\n\nOn July 18, 2018,[348] the European Commission fined Google €4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The abuse of dominant position has been referred to Google's constraint applied to Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018, Google confirmed[349] that it had appealed the fine to the General Court of the European Union.[350]\n\n\nOn October 8, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Google and Alphabet due to \"non-public\" Google+ account data being exposed as a result of a bug that allowed app developers to gain access to the private information of users. The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million with a payout to claimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12 each.[351][352][353]\n\n\nOn March 20, 2019, the European Commission imposed a €1.49 billion ($1.69 billion) fine on Google for preventing rivals from being able to \"compete and innovate fairly\" in the online advertising market. European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had violated EU antitrust rules by \"imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites\" that required them to exclude search results from Google's rivals.[354][355]\n\n\nOn September 14, 2022, Google lost the appeal over €4.125bn (£3.5bn) fine, which was ruled to be paid after it was proved by the European Commission that Google forced Android phone-makers to carry Google's search and web browser apps. Since the initial accusations, Google changed its policy.[356]\n\n\n\n##### France[edit]\n\n\nOn January 21, 2019, French data regulator CNIL imposed a record €50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The judgment claimed Google had failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google issued a statement saying it was \"deeply committed\" to transparency and was \"studying the decision\" before determining its response.[357]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2022, France's data privacy regulatory body CNIL fined Alphabet's Google 150 million euros (US$169 million) for not allowing its Internet users an easy refusal of Cookies along with Facebook.[358]\n\n\n\n##### United States[edit]\n\n\nAfter U.S. Congressional hearings in July 2020,[359] and a report from the U.S. House of Representatives' Antitrust Subcommittee released in early October[360] the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google on October 20, 2020, asserting that it has illegally maintained its monopoly position in web search and search advertising.[361][362] The lawsuit alleged that Google engaged in anticompetitive behavior by paying Apple between $8 billion-$12 billion to be the default search engine on iPhones.[363] Later that month, both Facebook and Alphabet agreed to \"cooperate and assist one another\" in the face of investigation into their online advertising practices.[364][365] Another suit was brought against Google in 2023 for illegally monopolizing the advertising technology market.[366]\n\n\n\n#### Private browsing lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Private browsing\n\nIn early June 2020, a $5 billion class-action lawsuit was filed against Google by a group of consumers, alleging that Chrome's Incognito browsing mode still collects their user history.[367][368] The lawsuit became known in March 2021 when a federal judge denied Google's request to dismiss the case, ruling that they must face the group's charges.[369][370] Reuters reported that the lawsuit alleged that Google's CEO Sundar Pichai sought to keep the users unaware of this issue.[371]\n\n\n\n#### Gender discrimination lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, three women sued Google, accusing the company of violating California's Equal Pay Act by underpaying its female employees. The lawsuit cited the wage gap was around $17,000 and that Google locked women into lower career tracks, leading to smaller salaries and bonuses. In June 2022, Google agreed to pay a $118 million settlement to 15,550 female employees working in California since 2013. As a part of the settlement, Google also agreed to hire a third party to analyze its hiring and compensation practices.[372][373][374]\n\n\n\n#### U.S. government contracts[edit]\n\n\nFollowing media reports about PRISM, the NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.[375] According to unnamed sources, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009, as YouTube in 2010.[376]\n\n\nGoogle has worked with the United States Department of Defense on drone software through the 2017 Project Maven that could be used to improve the accuracy of drone strikes.[377] In April 2018, thousands of Google employees, including senior engineers, signed a letter urging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to end this controversial contract with the Pentagon.[378] Google ultimately decided not to renew this DoD contract, which was set to expire in 2019.[379]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Google\n* History of Google\n* List of Google products\n* Google China\n* Google logo\n* Googlization\n* Google.org\n* Google ATAP\n* List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Google was incorporated on September 4, 1998, however, since 2002, the company has celebrated its anniversaries on various days in September, most frequently on September 27.[1][2][3] The shift in dates reportedly happened to celebrate index-size milestones in tandem with the birthday.[4]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Fitzpatrick, Alex (September 4, 2014). \"Google Used to Be the Company That Did 'Nothing But Search'\". *Time*.\n2. **^** \"When is Google's birthday – and why are people confused?\". *The Telegraph*.

It allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters, be organized by hashtags, and be associated with a location via geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.[11]\n\n\nInstagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1) aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restriction was eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. It also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a Stories feature—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allowed users to post their content to a sequential feed, with each post accessible to others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories is used by 500 million people daily.[11]\n\n\n\nOriginally launched for iOS in October 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion by June 2018. In April 2012, Facebook Inc. acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. As of October 2015[update], over 40 billion photos had been uploaded. Although often admired for its success and influence, Instagram has also been criticized for negatively affecting teens' mental health, its policy and interface changes, its alleged censorship, and illegal and inappropriate content uploaded by users.\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Instagram.\n\n![](image)Instagram icon from 2016 to 2022, when it was updated to include even more saturated colors\nInstagram began development in San Francisco as **Burbn**, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 (equivalent to $682,200 in 2023) seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn.[12][13] Realizing that it was too similar to Foursquare, they refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among its users.[14][15] They renamed it Instagram, a portmanteau of instant camera and telegram.[16]\n\n\n\n### 2010–2011: Beginnings and major funding[edit]\n\n\nJosh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager,[17] Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer,[17] and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011.[17][18]\n\n\nThe first Instagram post was a photo of South Beach Harbor at Pier 38, posted by Mike Krieger at 5:26 p.m. on July 16, 2010.[19][15] Systrom shared his first post, a picture of a dog and his girlfriend's foot, a few hours later at 9:24 p.m. It has been wrongly attributed as the first Instagram photo due to the earlier letter of the alphabet in its URL.[20][21][*better source needed*] On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App Store. In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million (equivalent to $9,357,057 in 2023) in Series A funding from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo.[22] The deal valued Instagram at around $20 million. In April 2012, Instagram raised $50 million (equivalent to $65,610,000 in 2023) from venture capitalists with a valuation of $500 million (equivalent to $656,100,000 in 2023).[23] Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's Series B fundraising round, leading his investment firm, Thrive Capital, to double its money after the sale to Facebook.[24]\n\n\n\n### 2012–2014: Additional platforms and acquisition by Facebook[edit]\n\n\nOn April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones,[25][26] and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day.[27] The Android app has since received two significant updates: first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of the app by half and added performance improvements;[28][29] then in April 2017, to add an offline mode that allows users to view and interact with content without an Internet connection. At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users were located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at its announcement, Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline, and that they were \"exploring an iOS version\".On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms) bought Instagram for $1 billion (equivalent to $1,312,000,000 in 2023) in cash and stock ,[30][31][32] with a plan to keep the company independently managed.[33][34][35] Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012,[36] and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed.[37] On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook officially closed with a purchase price of $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock.[38]\n\n\nThe deal closed just before Facebook's scheduled initial public offering according to CNN.[35] The deal price was compared to the $35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005.[35] Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was \"committed to building and growing Instagram independently.\"[35] According to *Wired*, the deal netted Systrom $400 million.[39]\n\n\nIn November 2012, Instagram launched website profiles, allowing anyone to see user feeds from a web browser with limited functionality,[40] as well as a selection of *badges*, and web widget buttons to link to profiles.[41]\n\n\nSince the app's launch it had used the Foursquare API technology to provide named location tagging. In March 2014, Instagram started to test and switch the technology to use Facebook Places.[42][43]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### 2015–2017: Redesign and Windows app[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Instagram headquarters in Menlo Park\nIn June 2015, the desktop website user interface was redesigned to become more flat and minimalistic, but with more screen space for each photo and to resemble the layout of Instagram's mobile website.[44][45][46] Furthermore, one row of pictures only has three instead of five photos to match the mobile layout. The *slideshow banner*[47][48] on the top of profile pages, which simultaneously slide-showed seven picture tiles of pictures posted by the user, alternating at different times in a random order, has been removed. In addition, the formerly angular profile pictures became circular.\n\n\nIn April 2016, Instagram released a Windows 10 Mobile app, after years of demand from Microsoft and the public to release an app for the platform.[49][50] The platform previously had a beta version of Instagram, first released on November 21, 2013, for Windows Phone 8.[51][52][53] The new app added support for videos (viewing and creating posts or stories, and viewing live streams), album posts and direct messages.[54] Similarly, an app for Windows 10 personal computers and tablets was released in October 2016.[55][56] In May, Instagram updated its mobile website to allow users to upload photos, and to add a \"lightweight\" version of the Explore tab.[57][58]\n\n\nOn May 11, 2016, Instagram revamped its design, adding a black-and-white flat design theme for the app's user interface, and a less skeuomorphistic, more abstract, \"modern\" and colorful icon.[59][60][61] Rumors of a redesign first started circulating in April, when *The Verge* received a screenshot from a tipster, but at the time, an Instagram spokesperson simply told the publication that it was only a concept.[62]\n\n\nOn December 6, 2016, Instagram introduced comment liking. However, unlike post likes, the user who posted a comment does not receive notifications about comment likes in their notification inbox. Uploaders can optionally decide to deactivate comments on a post.[63][64][65]\n\n\nThe mobile website allows uploading pictures since May 4, 2017. Image filters and the ability to upload videos were not introduced then.[66][67]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2019, the Windows 10 Mobile app was discontinued, though the mobile website remains available as a progressive web application (PWA) with limited functionality. The app remains available on Windows 10 computers and tablets, also updated to a PWA in 2020.\n\n\n\n### 2018–2019: IGTV, removal of the like counter, management changes[edit]\n\n\nTo comply with the GDPR regulations regarding data portability, Instagram introduced the ability for users to download an archive of their user data in April 2018.[68][69][70]\n\n\nIGTV launched on June 20, 2018, as a standalone video application. The application was shut down and removed from app stores in March 2022, citing low usage and a shift to short-form video content.[71]\n\n\nOn September 24, 2018, Krieger and Systrom announced in a statement they would be stepping down from Instagram.[72][73] On October 1, 2018, it was announced that Adam Mosseri would be the new head of Instagram.[74][75][76]\n\n\nDuring Facebook F8, it was announced that Instagram would, beginning in Canada, pilot the removal of publicly displayed \"like\" counts for content posted by other users.[77] Like counts would only be visible to the user who originally posted the content. Mosseri stated that this was intended to have users \"worry a little bit less about how many likes they're getting on Instagram and spend a bit more time connecting with the people that they care about.\"[78][79] It has been argued that low numbers of likes in relativity to others could contribute to a lower self-esteem in users.[79][77] The pilot began in May 2019, and was extended to 6 other markets in July.[79][80] The pilot was expanded worldwide in November 2019.[81] Also in July 2019, Instagram announced that it would implement new features designed to reduce harassment and negative comments on the service.[82]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Instagram also began to pilot the removal of the \"Following\" tab from the app, which had allowed users to view a feed of the likes and comments made by users they follow. The change was made official in October, with head of product Vishal Shah stating that the feature was underused and that some users were \"surprised\" when they realized their activity was being surfaced in this manner.[83][84]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Instagram introduced a limit on the number of posts visible in page scrolling mode unless logged in. Until this point, public profiles had been available to all users, even when not logged in. Following the change, after viewing a number of posts a pop-up requires the user to log in to continue viewing content.[85][86][87]\n\n\nThat month, Instagram launched a separate app known as Threads. Similar to Snapchat, the app allowed users to communicate through messaging and video chats.[88] It was integrated with Instagram's \"Close friends\" feature, so that users could send images, photos, and texts privately to others, and also had Instagram's photo editing system embedded into the app.[89][90] However, Instagram discontinued this version of Threads in December 2021,[91] mainly due to most of its features being rolled out on Instagram itself, as well as low usage compared to other social media applications.[92] Threads was not well-received among Instagram's user base. Since its launch, only approximately 220,000 users globally downloaded the app, which represented less than 0.1% of Instagram's monthly active users, indicating a lack of success in driving adoption.[93]\n\n\n\n### 2020–present: New features[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Instagram launched a new feature called \"Co-Watching\". The new feature allows users to share posts with each other over video calls. According to Instagram, they pushed forward the launch of Co-Watching in order to meet the demand for virtually connecting with friends and family due to social distancing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[94]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Instagram began a pivot to video, introducing a new feature called \"Reels\".[95][96][97] The intent was to compete with the video-sharing site TikTok.[97][98][95] Instagram also added suggested posts in August 2020. After scrolling through posts from the past 48 hours, Instagram displays posts related to their interests from accounts they do not follow.[99]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Instagram began testing a new feature called Vertical Stories, said by some sources to be inspired by TikTok.[100] The same month, they also began testing the removal of ability to share feed posts to stories.[101]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Instagram launched a new feature in which four people can go live at once.[102] Instagram also announced that adults would not be allowed to message teens who don't follow them as part of a series of new child safety policies.[103][104][105][106]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Instagram began allowing users in some regions to add pronouns to their profile page.[107][108]\n\n\nOn October 4, 2021, Meta services suffered their worst outage since 2008, bringing down Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.[109][110] Security experts identified the problem as possibly being DNS-related.[111]\n\n\nOn March 17, 2022, Zuckerberg confirmed plans to add non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to the platform. In September 2022, Ireland's Data Protection Commission fined the company $402 million under privacy laws recently adopted by the European Union over how it handled the privacy data of minors.[112][113][114]\n\n\nAfter being trialled in mid-2022,[115] Instagram introduced Notes in December 2022. This feature allows users to share updates as short text posts of up to 60 characters with certain people, who can then reply to them using messaging on Instagram.[116][117]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Instagram introduced a new feature allowing users to browse and post GIFs in their comments.[118] That same month, Zuckerberg announced that Meta would start selling blue \"verified\" badges on Instagram and Facebook.[119]\n\n\nOn July 5, 2023, Meta launched Threads, a social network platform connected to Instagram that allows users to make public shortform blog posts comprising text, photos, and videos, as well as to converse with other users and reblog other users' posts. Threads aims to compete with Twitter.[120][121][122]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Instagram began testing the removal of the ability to see \"recent\" posts from various hashtags.[123] This change became permanent and system wide a year later, and now hashtags can only be used to see a selection of curated content from \"top\" users.[124] These changes are ostensibly an attempt to hinder the spread of misinformation, while Instagram has also repeatedly stated that hashtags do not help posts get views.[125]\n\n\n\n## Features and tools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An original photograph (left) is automatically cropped to a square by Instagram, and has a filter added at the selection of the user (right).\n![](image)A photo collage of an unprocessed image (top left) modified with the 16 different Instagram filters available in 2011\nUsers can upload photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds,[126] and geotag images with the name of a location.[127] Users can set their account as \"private\", thereby requiring that they approve any new follower requests.[128] Users can connect their Instagram account to other social networking sites, enabling them to share uploaded photos to those sites.[129] In September 2011, a new version of the app included new and live filters, instant tilt–shift, high-resolution photographs, optional borders, one-click rotation, and an updated icon.[130][131] Photos were initially restricted to a square, 1:1 aspect ratio; since August 2015, the app supports portrait and widescreen aspect ratios as well.[132][133][134] Users could formerly view a map of a user's geotagged photos. The feature was removed in September 2016, citing low usage.[135][136]\n\n\nSince December 2016, posts can be \"saved\" into a private area of the app.[137][138] The feature was updated in April 2017 to let users organize saved posts into named collections.[139][140] Users can also \"archive\" their posts in a private storage area, out of visibility for the public and other users. The move was seen as a way to prevent users from deleting photos that don't garner a desired number of \"likes\" or are deemed boring, but also as a way to limit the \"emergent behavior\" of deleting photos, which deprives the service of content.[141][142] In August, Instagram announced that it would start organizing comments into threads, letting users more easily interact with replies.[143][144]\n\n\nSince February 2017, up to ten pictures or videos can be included in a single post, with the content appearing as a swipeable carousel.[145][146] The feature originally limited photos to the square format, but received an update in August to enable portrait and landscape photos instead.[147][148]\n\n\nIn April 2018, Instagram launched its version of a portrait mode called \"focus mode,\" which gently blurs the background of a photo or video while keeping the subject in focus when selected.[149] In November, Instagram began to support Alt text to add descriptions of photos for the visually impaired. They are either generated automatically using object recognition (using existing Facebook technology) or manually specified by the uploader.[150]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2021, Instagram launched a new feature named Instagram Live \"Rooms\" Let Four People Go Live Together.[151]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Instagram announced a new accessibility feature for videos on Instagram Reels and Stories to allow creators to place closed captions on their content.[152]\n\n\n\n### Hashtags[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2011, Instagram introduced hashtags to help users discover both photos and each other.[153][154] Instagram encourages users to make tags both specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like \"photo\", to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users.[155]\n\n\nUsers on Instagram have created \"trends\" through hashtags. The trends deemed the most popular on the platform often highlight a specific day of the week to post the material on. Examples of popular trends include #SelfieSunday, in which users post a photo of their faces on Sundays; #MotivationMonday, in which users post motivational photos on Mondays; #TransformationTuesday, in which users post photos highlighting differences from the past to the present; #WomanCrushWednesday, in which users post photos of women they have a romantic interest in or view favorably, as well as its #ManCrushMonday counterpart centered on men; and #ThrowbackThursday, in which users post a photo from their past, highlighting a particular moment.[156][157]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Instagram began to allow users to follow hashtags, which display relevant highlights of the topic in their feeds.[158][159] The ability to search \"Recent\" hashtags was temporarily disabled during the 2020 US elections, to prevent the spread of misinformation.[160] In 2022 this was again tested on some users, and in April 2023 the ability to search recent hashtags was removed entirely. Now, users are only able to see a curated selection of \"popular\" posts using a given hashtag. Instagram states that this is to prevent abuse and that hashtags do not help users gain views, but it has been noted that using hashtags is the only free method for a user to reach past their existing followers.[161]\n\n\n\n### Explore[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2012, Instagram introduced \"Explore\", a tab inside the app that displays popular photos, photos taken at nearby locations, and search.[162] The tab was updated in June 2015 to feature trending tags and places, curated content, and the ability to search for locations.[163] In April 2016, Instagram added a \"Videos You Might Like\" channel to the tab,[164][165] followed by an \"Events\" channel in August, featuring videos from concerts, sports games, and other live events,[166][167] followed by the addition of Instagram Stories in October.[168][169] The tab was later expanded again in November 2016 after Instagram Live launched to display an algorithmically curated page of the \"best\" Instagram Live videos currently airing.[170] In May 2017, Instagram once again updated the Explore tab to promote public Stories content from nearby places.[171]\n\n\n\n### Photographic filters[edit]\n\n\nInstagram offers a number of photographic filters that users can apply to their images. In February 2012, Instagram added a \"Lux\" filter, an effect that \"lightens shadows, darkens highlights and increases contrast\".[172][173] In December 2014, Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Aden, and Perpetua were five new filters to be added to the Instagram filter family.[174]\n\n\n\n### Video[edit]\n\n\nInitially a purely photo-sharing service, Instagram incorporated 15-second video sharing in June 2013.[175][176] The addition was seen by some in the technology media as Facebook's attempt at competing with the then-popular video-sharing application Vine.[177][178] In August 2015, Instagram added support for widescreen videos.[179][180] In March 2016, Instagram increased the 15-second video limit to 60 seconds.[181][182] Albums were introduced in February 2017, which allow up to 10 minutes of video to be shared in one post.[145][146][183]\n\n\n\n#### IGTV[edit]\n\n\nMain article: IGTV\n\nIGTV is a vertical video application launched by Instagram[184] in June 2018. Basic functionality is also available within the Instagram app and website. IGTV allows uploads of up to 10 minutes in length with a file size of up to 650 MB, with verified and popular users allowed to upload videos of up to 60 minutes in length with a file size of up to 5.4 GB.[185] The app automatically begins playing videos as soon as it is launched, which CEO Kevin Systrom contrasted to video hosts where one must first locate a video.[186][187][188] In March 2022, the application was shut down.[71]\n\n\n\n#### Reels[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2019, it was reported that Instagram had begun to pilot a new video feature known as \"Reels\" in Brazil, expanding to France and Germany afterwards.[189] It is similar in functionality to the Chinese video-sharing service TikTok, with a focus on allowing users to record short videos set to pre-existing sound clips from other posts.[190] Users could make up to 15 (later 30) second videos using this feature.[191] Reels also integrates with existing Instagram filters and editing tools.[185]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Instagram rolled out Reels to India after TikTok was banned in the country.[192] The following month, Reels officially launched in 50 countries including the United States, Canada and United Kingdom.[193] Instagram has recently introduced a reel button on home page.[194]\n\n\nOn June 17, 2021, Instagram launched full-screen advertisements in Reels. The ads are similar to regular reels and can run up to 30 seconds. They are distinguished from regular content by the \"sponsored\" tag under the account name.[195]\n\n\nDespite the \"TikTokification\" of Reels and the parent company Meta spending millions on courting content creators, user engagement continued to lag far behind TikTok as of 2022.[196]\n\n\n\n### Instagram Direct[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2013, Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a feature that lets users interact through private messaging. Users who follow each other can send private messages with photos and videos, in contrast to the public-only requirement that was previously in place. When users receive a private message from someone they don't follow, the message is marked as pending and the user must accept to see it. Users can send a photo to a maximum of 15 people.[197][198][199] The feature received a major update in September 2015, adding conversation threading and making it possible for users to share locations, hashtag pages, and profiles through private messages directly from the news feed. Additionally, users can now reply to private messages with text, emoji or by clicking on a heart icon. A camera inside Direct lets users take a photo and send it to the recipient without leaving the conversation.[200][201][202] A new update in November 2016 let users make their private messages \"disappear\" after being viewed by the recipient, with the sender receiving a notification if the recipient takes a screenshot.[203][204]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Instagram redesigned Direct to combine all private messages, both permanent and ephemeral, into the same message threads.[205][206][207] In May, Instagram made it possible to send website links in messages, and also added support for sending photos in their original portrait or landscape orientation without cropping.[208][209]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Direct became accessible from the Instagram website, allowing users to send direct messages from a web version using WebSocket technology.[210]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Facebook started merging Instagram Direct into Facebook Messenger. After the update (which is rolled out to a segment of the user base) the Instagram Direct icon transforms into Facebook Messenger icon.[211]\n\n\nIn March 2021, a feature was added that prevents adults from messaging users under 18 who do not follow them as part of a series of new child safety policies.[103][104][105]\n\n\n\n### Instagram Stories[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2016, Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a feature that allows users to take photos, add effects and layers, and add them to their Instagram story. Images uploaded to a user's story expire after 24 hours. The media noted the feature's similarities to Snapchat.[212][213] In response to criticism that it copied functionality from Snapchat, CEO Kevin Systrom told *Recode* that \"Day One: Instagram was a combination of Hipstamatic, Twitter [and] some stuff from Facebook like the 'Like' button. You can trace the roots of every feature anyone has in their app, somewhere in the history of technology\". Although Systrom acknowledged the criticism as \"fair\", *Recode* wrote that \"he likened the two social apps' common features to the auto industry: Multiple car companies can coexist, with enough differences among them that they serve different consumer audiences\". Systrom further stated that \"When we adopted [Stories], we decided that one of the really annoying things about the format is that it just kept going and you couldn't pause it to look at something, you couldn't rewind. We did all that, we implemented that.\" He also told the publication that Snapchat \"didn't have filters, originally. They adopted filters because Instagram had filters and a lot of others were trying to adopt filters as well.\"[214][215]\n\n\nIn November, Instagram added live video functionality to Instagram Stories, allowing users to broadcast themselves live, with the video disappearing immediately after ending.[216][170]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Instagram launched skippable ads, where five-second photo and 15-second video ads appear in-between different stories.[217][218][219]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Instagram Stories incorporated augmented reality stickers, a \"clone\" of Snapchat's functionality.[220][221][219]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Instagram expanded the augmented reality sticker feature to support face filters, letting users add specific visual features onto their faces.[222][223]\n\n\nLater in May, *TechCrunch* reported about tests of a Location Stories feature in Instagram Stories, where public Stories content at a certain location are compiled and displayed on a business, landmark or place's Instagram page.[224] A few days later, Instagram announced \"Story Search\", in which users can search for geographic locations or hashtags and the app displays relevant public Stories content featuring the search term.[171][225]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Instagram revised its live-video functionality to allow users to add their live broadcast to their story for availability in the next 24 hours, or discard the broadcast immediately.[226] In July, Instagram started allowing users to respond to Stories content by sending photos and videos, complete with Instagram effects such as filters, stickers, and hashtags.[227][228]\n\n\nStories were made available for viewing on Instagram's mobile and desktop websites in late August 2017.[229][230]\n\n\nOn December 5, 2017, Instagram introduced \"Story Highlights\",[231] also known as \"Permanent Stories\", which are similar to Instagram Stories, but don't expire. They appear as circles below the profile picture and biography and are accessible from the desktop website as well.\n\n\nIn June 2018, the daily active story users of Instagram had reached 400 million users, and monthly active users had reached 1 billion active users.[232]\n\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\nEmily White joined Instagram as Director of Business Operations in April 2013.[233][234] She stated in an interview with *The Wall Street Journal* in September 2013 that the company should be ready to begin selling advertising by September 2014 as a way to generate business from a popular entity that had not yet created profit for its parent company.[235] White left Instagram in December 2013 to join Snapchat.[236][237] In August 2014, James Quarles became Instagram's Global Head of Business and Brand Development, tasked with overseeing advertisement, sales efforts, and developing new \"monetization products\", according to a spokesperson.[238]\n\n\nIn October 2013, Instagram announced that video and image ads would soon appear in feeds for users in the United States,[239][240] with the first image advertisements displaying on November 1, 2013.[241][242] Video ads followed nearly a year later on October 30, 2014.[243][244] In June 2014, Instagram announced the rollout of ads in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia,[245] with ads starting to roll out that autumn.[246]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Instagram announced it would implement \"carousel ads,\" allowing advertisers to display multiple images with options for linking to additional content.[247][248] The company launched carousel image ads in October 2015,[249][250] and video carousel ads in March 2016.[251]\n\n\nIn February 2016, Instagram announced that it had 200,000 advertisers on the platform.[252] This number increased to 500,000 by September 2016,[253] and 1 million in March 2017.[254][255]\n\n\nIn May 2016, Instagram launched new tools for business accounts, including business profiles, analytics and the ability to promote posts as ads. To access the tools, businesses had to link a corresponding Facebook page.[256] The new analytics page, known as Instagram Insights, allowed business accounts to view top posts, reach, impressions, engagement and demographic data.[256] Insights rolled out first in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, and expanded to the rest of the world later in 2016.[257][256][258]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Instagram added the ability for business accounts to add product links directing users to a purchase page or to save them to a \"shopping list.\"[259] In April 2019, Instagram added the option to \"Checkout on Instagram,\" which allows merchants to sell products directly through the Instagram app.[260]\n\n\nIn March 2020, via a blog post, Instagram announced that they are making major moderation changes in order to decrease the flow of disinformation, hoaxes and fake news regarding COVID-19 on its platform, \"We'll remove COVID-19 accounts from account recommendations, and we are working to remove some COVID-19 related content from Explore unless posted by a credible health organization. We will also start to downrank content in feed and Stories that has been rated false by third-party fact-checkers.\"[261]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Instagram launched a native affiliate marketing tool creators can use to earn commissions based on sales. Commission-enabled posts are labeled \"Eligible for Commission\" on the user side to identify them as affiliate posts. Launch partners included Sephora, MAC, and Kopari.[262]\n\n\n\n### Stand-alone apps[edit]\n\n\nInstagram has developed and released three stand-alone apps with specialized functionality. In July 2014, it released **Bolt**, a messaging app where users click on a friend's profile photo to quickly send an image, with the content disappearing after being seen.[263][264] It was followed by the release of Hyperlapse in August, an iOS-exclusive app that uses \"clever algorithm processing\" to create tracking shots and fast time-lapse videos.[265][266] Microsoft launched a Hyperlapse app for Android and Windows in May 2015, but there has been no official Hyperlapse app from Instagram for either of these platforms to date.[267] In October 2015, it released **Boomerang**, a video app that combines photos into short, one-second videos that play back-and-forth in a loop.[268][269]\n\n\n\n### Third-party services[edit]\n\n\nThe popularity of Instagram has led to a variety of third-party services designed to integrate with it, including services for creating content to post on the service and generating content from Instagram photos (including physical print-outs), analytics, and alternative clients for platforms with insufficient or no official support from Instagram (such as in the past, iPads).[270][271]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Instagram announced that effective June 1, 2016, it would end \"feed\" API access to its platform in order to \"maintain control for the community and provide a clear roadmap for developers\" and \"set up a more sustainable environment built around authentic experiences on the platform\", including those oriented towards content creation, publishers, and advertisers. Additionally, third-party clients have been prohibited from using the text strings \"insta\" or \"gram\" in their name.[272] It was reported that these changes were primarily intended to discourage third-party clients replicating the entire Instagram experience (due to increasing monetization of the service), and security reasons (such as preventing abuse by automated click farms, and the hijacking of accounts). In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Instagram began to impose further restrictions on its API in 2018.[271][273][274]\n\n\nFor unlimited browsing of public Instagram profiles without having to create an account, as well as for anonymous browsing of someone else's Stories, has to use the Instagram profiles viewer.[275] Stories are more authentic than typical photos posted as posts because users know that in 24 hours their Stories will disappear if they don't add them as highlighted[276] (however users can check who saw their Story for 48 hours after it was published[277]). For this reason, they are very valuable for market research.[278]\n\n\n\n### Fact checking[edit]\n\n\nOn December 16, 2019, Facebook announced it would expand its fact checking programs towards Instagram,[279] by using third-party fact-checkers organizations false information is able to be identified, reviewed and labeled as false information. Content when rated as false or partly false is removed from the explore page and hashtag pages, additionally content rated as false or partly false are labeled as such. With the addition of Facebook fact-checking program came the use of image matching technology to find further instances of misinformation. If a piece of content is labeled false or partly false on Facebook or Instagram then duplicates of such content will also be labeled as false.[280]\n\n\n\n### Algorithm and design changes[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Instagram began rolling out a change to the order of photos visible in a user's timeline, shifting from a strictly chronological order to one determined by an algorithm.[281] Instagram said the algorithm was designed so that users would see more of the photos by users that they liked,[282] but there was significant negative feedback, with many users asking their followers to turn on post notifications in order to make sure they see updates.[283][284][285] The company wrote a tweet to users upset at the prospect of the change, but did not back down,[286] nor provide a way to change it back, which they re-affirmed in 2020.[287][288] However, in December 2021, Adam Mosseri, in a Senate hearing on child safety issues, stated that the company is developing a version of the feed that would show user posts in chronological order.[289] He later clarified the company would introduce two modes: a classic chronological feed and a version of it that would let users pick \"favorite\" users whose posts would be shown at the top in chronological order while other posts would be mixed in below.[290]\n\n\nSince 2017, Instagram has employed the ability to reduce the prominence of accounts (\"shadowbanning\") it believes may be generating non-genuine engagement and spam (including excessive use of unneeded hashtags), preventing posts from appearing in search results and in the app's Explore section. In a now-deleted Facebook post, Instagram wrote that \"When developing content, we recommend focusing on your business objective or goal rather than hashtags\".[291][292] Instagram has since been accused of extending the practice to censor posts under vague and inconsistent circumstances, particularly in regards to sexually suggestive material.[293]\n\n\nInstagram caused the userbase to fall into outrage with the December 2018 update.[294][295][296][297][298][*excessive citations*] They found an attempt to alter the flow of the feed from the traditional vertical scroll to emulate and piggy-back the popularity of their Instagram Stories with a horizontal scroll, by swiping left.[299] Various backtracking statements were released explaining it as a bug, or as a test release that had been accidentally deployed to too large an audience.[297][296]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Instagram replaced the activity feed tab with a new \"Shop\" tab, moving the activity feed to the top. The \"new post\" button was also relocated to the top and replaced with a Reels tab[300] The company states that \"the Shop tab gives you a better way to connect with brands and creators and discover products you love\" and the Reels tab \"makes it easier for you to discover short, fun videos from creators all over the world and people just like you.\"[301] However, users have not responded well to the change, taking their complaints to Twitter and Reddit, and *The New York Times* has shunned Reels in particular, saying \"Not only does Reels fail in every way as a TikTok clone, but it’s confusing, frustrating and impossible to navigate\".[302]\n\n\nAlso in 2020, Instagram rolled out a feature titled \"suggested posts\", which adds posts from accounts Instagram thinks a user would like to such user's feed.[303] The feature was met with controversy from both Reddit users[304] from *The Verge*, which reported that suggested posts would keep users glued to their feed, give Instagram more advertising space, and ultimately harm the mental health of users, while Instagram executive Julian Gutman rebutted, stating the feature was not intended to keep users glued to their screens.[305] Suggested posts received more controversy after Fast Company stated that the feature would be impossible to turn off.[306]\n\n\nOn June 23, 2021, Instagram announced a test change to the \"suggested posts\" feature. The company will put suggested posts ahead of posts from people who the user is following in the Instagram feed, citing positive reception as the reason for this change.[307]\n\n\n\n## Scientific studies[edit]\n\n\n### Harmful effect on teenage girls' mental health[edit]\n\n\nFacebook has known for years that its Instagram app is harmful to a large number of teenagers, according to research seen by *The Wall Street Journal*, but the company concealed the knowledge from lawmakers.[308] The internal Facebook presentations seen by the *Journal* in 2021 show that Instagram is toxic to a sizable percentage of its users, particularly teenage girls. More than 40% of Instagram's users are under 23 years old. The presentations were seen by the company's executives and the findings mentioned to Mark Zuckerberg in 2020, but when asked in March 2021 about Instagram's effect on young people, Zuckerberg defended the company's plan to launch an Instagram product for children under 13.[308] When asked by senators for its internal findings on the impact of Instagram on youth mental health, Facebook sent a six-page letter that did not include the company's research. The company told Forbes that its research is \"kept confidential to promote frank and open dialogue and brainstorming internally.\"[309] In a blog post, Instagram said that the WSJ story \"focuses on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light.\"[310] On September 27, 2021, weeks after the WSJ report was released, Facebook announced that it had \"paused\" development of Instagram Kids, the Instagram product aimed at children. The company stated it was looking into concerns raised by the regulators and parents. Adam Mosseri stated that the company would return to the project as \"[t]he reality is that kids are already online, and we believe that developing age-appropriate experiences designed specifically for them is far better for parents than where we are today.\"[311][312] Based on Facebook's leaked internal research, Instagram has had negative effects on the body image of one in three teenagers.[313] Leaked internal documents also indicate that two thirds of teen girls and 40 percent of teen boys experience negative social comparison, and that Instagram makes 20 percent of the teens feel worse about themselves. According to the leaked research, Instagram has higher impact on appearance comparison than TikTok or Snapchat.[314] 13 percent of British, and 6 percent of US, teenager users with suicidal thoughts could trace them to Instagram use.[313]\n\n\n\n### Depression, anxiety and stress[edit]\n\n\nKhodarahimi and Fathi found evidence that Instagram users displayed higher levels of depressive and anxious symptoms compared to non-users.[315] However, Frison & Eggermont 2017 found that, among both boys and girls, browsing could predict the presence of depressive symptoms; liking and posting seemed to have no effect.[316] In addition, their study showed that the presence of depressive symptoms in a given user could positively predict that they would make posts.[316] The study showed that the viewing of celebrity and peer pictures could make the moods of women more negative.[316][317] In a 2021 study, Mun & Kim pointed out that Instagram users with a strong need for approval were more likely to falsely present themselves on their Instagram accounts, which in turn increased the likelihood of depression. However, depression was mitigated by the users' perception of their own popularity.[318]\n\n\nLub & Trub 2015 showed that following more strangers increases social comparisons and depressive symptoms.[319] Multiple studies have found that increasing time spent on Instagram increases social anxiety and anxiety related to personal traits, physical appearance, and high-stress body areas in particular.[320][321][322] Sherlock & Wagstaff 2019 showed that both the number of followers and followees can slightly increase anxiety over personal traits.[323] Additionally, Moujaes & Verrier 2020 observed a connection between online engagement with mothering-based influencers known as InstaMums and anxiety.[324] However, Mackson et al. 2019 suggested beneficial effects of Instagram use on anxiety symptoms.[325][324]\n\n\n\n### Body image[edit]\n\n\nInstagram users report higher body surveillance (the habitual monitoring of one's body shape and size),[326] appearance-related pressure,[327] eating-disorder-related-pathology[328] and lower body satisfaction[328] than non-users. Multiple studies have also shown that users who take more selfies before making a post, and those who strategically present themselves by participating in such activities as editing or manipulating selfies, report higher levels of body surveillance and body dissatisfaction, and lower body esteem overall.[329][330][331][332] Tiggermann et al. showed that facial satisfaction can decrease when one spends greater time editing selfies for Instagram. Comments related to appearance on Instagram can lead to higher dissatisfaction with one's body.[333][334][335][336]\n\n\n\n### Loneliness and social exclusion[edit]\n\n\nMackson et al. 2019 found that Instagram users were less lonely than non-users[325] and that Instagram membership predicts lower self-reported loneliness.[332] A 2021 study by Büttner & Rudertb also showed that not being tagged in an Instagram photo triggers the feeling of social exclusion and ostracism, especially for those with higher needs to belong.[337] However, Brailovskaia & Margraf 2018 found a significant positive relationship between Instagram membership and extraversion, life satisfaction, and social support. Their study showed only a marginally significant negative association between Instagram membership and self-conscientiousness.[338] Fioravanti et al. 2020 showed that women who had to take a break from Instagram for seven days reported higher life satisfaction compared to women who continued their habitual pattern of Instagram use. The effects seemed to be specific for women, where no significant differences were observed for men.[339] The relationship between Instagram use and the fear of missing out, or FOMO, has been confirmed in multiple studies.[340][341] Research shows that Instagram browsing predicts social comparison, which generates FOMO, which can ultimately lead to depression.[342]\n\n\n\n### Alcohol and drug use[edit]\n\n\nThere is a small positive correlation between the intensity of one's Instagram usage and alcohol consumption, with binge drinkers reporting greater intensity of Instagram use than non-binge drinkers.[343] Boyle et al. 2016 found a small to moderate positive relationship between alcohol consumption, enhanced drinking motives, and drinking behavior during college and Instagram usage,[344]\n\n\n\n### Eating disorders[edit]\n\n\nA comparison of Instagram users with non-users showed that boys with an Instagram account differ from boys without an account in terms of over-evaluation of their shape and weight, skipping meals, and levels of reported disordered eating cognitions. Girls with an Instagram account only differed from girls without an account in terms of skipping meals; they also had a stricter exercise schedule, a pattern not found in boys. This suggests a possible negative effect of Instagram usage on body satisfaction and disordered eating for both boys and girls.[332][345] Several studies identified a small positive relationship between time spent on Instagram and both internalization of beauty or muscular ideals and self-objectification.[332][346][347][348] Both Appel et al. 2016 and Feltman et al. 2017 found a positive link between the intensity of Instagram use and both body surveillance and dietary behaviors or disordered eating.[349][348]\n\n\n\n### Suicide and self-harm[edit]\n\n\nPicardo et al. 2020 examined the relationship between self-harm posts and actual self-harm behaviours offline and found such content had negative emotional effects on some users. The study also reported preliminary evidence of the online posts affecting offline behavior, but stopped short of claiming causality. At the same time, some benefits for those who engage with self-harm content online have been suggested.[350] Instagram has published resources to help users in need of support.[351]\n\n\n\n### Sharenting risks[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sharenting\n\nSharenting is when parents post content online, including images, about their children. Instagram is one of the most popular social media channels for sharenting. The hashtag #letthembelittle contains over 10 million images related to children on Instagram. Bare 2020 analysed 300 randomly selected, publicly available images under the hashtag and found that the corresponding images tended to contain children's personal information, including name, age and location.[352]\n\n\n\n### Instagram addiction[edit]\n\n\nSanz-Blas et al. 2019 showed that users who feel that they spend too much time on Instagram report higher levels of \"addiction\" to Instagram, which in turn was related to higher self-reported levels of stress induced by the app.[353] In a study focusing on the relationship between various psychological needs and \"addiction\" to Instagram by students, Foroughi et al. 2021 found that the desire for recognition and entertainment were predictors of students' addiction to Instagram. In addition, the study proved that addiction to Instagram negatively affected academic performance.[354] Additionally, Gezgin & Mihci 2020 found that frequent Instagram usage correlated with smartphone addiction.[355]\n\n\n\n## User characteristics and behavior[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Instagram app, running on the Android operating system\n### Users[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of most-followed Instagram accounts\n\nFollowing the release in October 2010, Instagram had one million registered users in December 2010.[356][357] In June 2011, it announced that it had 5 million users,[358] which increased to 10 million in September.[359][360] This growth continued to 30 million users in April 2012,[359][25] 80 million in July 2012,[361][362] 100 million in February 2013,[363][364] 130 million in June 2013,[365] 150 million in September 2013,[366][367] 300 million in December 2014,[368][369] 400 million in September 2015,[370][371] 500 million in June 2016,[372][373] 600 million in December 2016,[374][375] 700 million in April 2017,[376][377] and 800 million in September 2017.[378][379]\n\n\nIn June 2011, Instagram passed 100 million photos uploaded to the service.[380][381] This grew to 150 million in August 2011,[382][383] and by June 2013, there were over 16 billion photos on the service.[365] In October 2015, there existed over 40 billion photos.[384]\n\n\nIn October 2016, Instagram Stories reached 100 million active users, two months after launch.[385][386] This increased to 150 million in January 2017,[217][218] 200 million in April, surpassing Snapchat's user growth,[220][221][219] and 250 million active users in June 2017.[387][226]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Instagram Direct had 375 million monthly users.[205][206][207]\n\n\n\n#### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2014[update], Instagram's users are divided equally with 50% iPhone owners and 50% Android owners. While Instagram has a neutral gender-bias format, 68% of Instagram users are female while 32% are male. Instagram's geographical use is shown to favor urban areas as 17% of US adults who live in urban areas use Instagram while only 11% of adults in suburban and rural areas do so. While Instagram may appear to be one of the most widely used sites for photo sharing, only 7% of daily photo uploads, among the top four photo-sharing platforms, come from Instagram. Instagram has been proven to attract the younger generation with 90% of the 150 million users under the age of 35. From June 2012 to June 2013, Instagram approximately doubled their number of users. With regards to income, 15% of US Internet users who make less than $30,000 per year use Instagram, while 14% of those making $30,000 to $50,000, and 12% of users who make more than $50,000 per year do so.[388] With respect to the education demographic, respondents with some college education proved to be the most active on Instagram with 23%. Following behind, college graduates consist of 18% and users with a high school diploma or less make up 15%. Among these Instagram users, 24% say they use the app several times a day.[389]\n\n\n\n### User behavior[edit]\n\n\nOngoing research continues to explore how media content on the platform affects user engagement. Past research has found that media which show peoples' faces receive more 'likes' and comments and that using filters that increase warmth, exposure, and contrast also boosts engagement.[390] Users are more likely to engage with images that depict fewer individuals compared to groups and also are more likely to engage with content that has not been watermarked, as they view this content as less original and reliable compared to user-generated content.[391] Recently Instagram has come up with an option for users to apply for a verified account badge; however, this does not guarantee every user who applies will get the verified blue tick.[392]\n\n\nThe motives for using Instagram among young people are mainly to look at posts, particularly for the sake of social interactions and recreation. In contrast, the level of agreement expressed in creating Instagram posts was lower, which demonstrates that Instagram's emphasis on visual communication is widely accepted by young people in social communication.[393]\n\n\n\n### Performative activism[edit]\n\n\nStarting in June 2020, Instagram was more widely used as a platform for social justice movements including the Black Lives Matter movement.[394][395] This has changed how people address activism, created a lack of consistency in protest, and is not widely accepted.[396][397] Most notably in 2020, Shirien Damra shared an illustration and tribute she made of George Floyd after his death, and it resulted in more than 3.4 million \"likes\", followed by many offline reproductions of the illustration.[398][399] Instagram-based activism (as well as other social media) has been criticized and dismissed for being performative, reductionist, and overly focused on aesthetics.[396]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nInstagram was the runner-up for \"Best Mobile App\" at the 2010 *TechCrunch* Crunchies in January 2011.[400] In May 2011, *Fast Company* listed CEO Kevin Systrom at number 66 in \"The 100 Most Creative People in Business in 2011\".[401] In June 2011, *Inc.* included co-founders Systrom and Krieger in its 2011 \"30 Under 30\" list.[12]\n\n\nInstagram won \"Best Locally Made App\" in the *SF Weekly* Web Awards in September 2011.[402] *7x7Magazine'*s September 2011 issue featured Systrom and Krieger on the cover of their \"The Hot 20 2011\" issue.[403] In December 2011, Apple Inc. named Instagram the \"App of the Year\" for 2011.[404] In 2015, Instagram was named No. 1 by Mashable on its list of \"The 100 best iPhone apps of all time,\" noting Instagram as \"one of the most influential social networks in the world.\"[405] Instagram was listed among *Time*'s \"50 Best Android Applications for 2013\" list.[406]\n\n\n\n### Mental health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Social media and suicide\n\nIn May 2017, a survey conducted by the United Kingdom's Royal Society for Public Health, featuring 1,479 people aged 14–24, asking them to rate social media platforms depending on anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image, concluded that Instagram was the \"worst for young mental health\". Some have suggested it may contribute to digital dependence, whilst this same survey noticed its positive effects, including self-expression, self-identity, and community building. In response to the survey, Instagram stated that \"Keeping Instagram a safe and supportive place for young people was a top priority\".[407][408] The company filters out the reviews and accounts. If some of the accounts violate Instagram's community guidelines, it will take action, which could include banning them.[409]\n\n\nIn 2017, researchers from Harvard University and University of Vermont demonstrated a machine learning tool that successfully outperformed general practitioners' diagnostic success rate for depression. The tool used color analysis, metadata components, and face detection of users' feeds.[410]\n\n\nIn 2019, Instagram began to test the hiding of like counts for posts made by its users, with the feature later made available to everyone.\n\n\nCorrelations have been made between Instagram content and dissatisfaction with one's body, as a result of people comparing themselves to other users. In a recent survey half of the applicants admitted to photo editing behavior which has been linked with concerns over body image.[411]\n\n\nIn October 2021, CNN published an article and interviews on two young women, Ashlee Thomas and Anastasia Vlasova, saying Instagram endangered their lives due to it having toxic effects on their diets.[412]\n\n\nIn October, 2023, 42 states from the USA filed a lawsuit against Instagram and parent company Meta, accusing them of contributing to a youth mental health crisis due to the addictive nature of the platforms. The lawsuit claims that Meta and its Instagram unit repeatedly misled the public about the dangers of its platforms and knowingly induced young children and teenagers into addictive and compulsive social media use. Meta representatives replied that they were disappointed with the lawsuit and were hoping instead to continue working with other companies from the industry to create new and better standards for applications teens use.[413][414]\n\n\n\n#### Negative comments[edit]\n\n\nIn response to abusive and negative comments on users' photos, Instagram has made efforts to give users more control over their posts and accompanying comments field. In July 2016, it announced that users would be able to turn off comments for their posts, as well as control the language used in comments by inputting words they consider offensive, which will ban applicable comments from showing up.[415][416] After the July 2016 announcement, the ability to ban specific words began rolling out early August to celebrities,[417] followed by regular users in September.[418] In December, the company began rolling out the abilities for users to turn off the comments and, for private accounts, remove followers.[419][420]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Instagram announced that it would automatically attempt to filter offensive, harassing, and \"spammy\" comments by default. The system is built using a Facebook-developed deep learning algorithm known as DeepText (first implemented on the social network to detect spam comments), which utilizes natural-language processing techniques, and can also filter by user-specified keywords.[421][422][409]\n\n\nIn September 2017, the company announced that public users would be able to limit who can comment on their content, such as only their followers or people they follow. At the same time, it updated its automated comment filter to support additional languages.[423][424]\n\n\nIn July 2019, the service announced that it would introduce a system to proactively detect problematic comments and encourage the user to reconsider their comment, as well as allowing users the ability to \"restrict\" others' abilities to communicate with them, citing that younger users felt the existing block system was too much of an escalation.[82]\n\n\nAn April 2022 study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that Instagram failed to act on 90% of abusive direct messages (DMs) sent to five high-profile women, despite the DMs being reported to moderators. The participants of the study included actress Amber Heard, journalist Bryony Gordon, television presenter Rachel Riley, activist Jamie Klingler and magazine founder Sharan Dhaliwal. Instagram disputed many of the study's conclusions.[425][426][427]\n\n\n\n### Culture[edit]\n\n\nOn August 9, 2012, English musician Ellie Goulding released a new music video for her song \"Anything Could Happen.\" The video only contained fan-submitted Instagram photographs that used various filters to represent words or lyrics from the song, and over 1,200 different photographs were submitted.[428]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2017, reports surfaced that a bug in Instagram's developer tools had allowed \"one or more individuals\" to gain access to the contact information, specifically email addresses and phone numbers, of several high-profile verified accounts, including its most followed user, Selena Gomez. The company said in a statement that it had \"fixed the bug swiftly\" and was running an investigation.[429][430] However, the following month, more details emerged, with a group of hackers selling contact information online, with the affected number of accounts in the \"millions\" rather than the previously assumed limitation on verified accounts. Hours after the hack, a searchable database was posted online, charging $10 per search.[431] *The Daily Beast* was provided with a sample of the affected accounts, and could confirm that, while many of the email addresses could be found with a Google search in public sources, some did not return relevant Google search results and thus were from private sources.[432] *The Verge* wrote that cybersecurity firm RepKnight had found contact information for multiple actors, musicians, and athletes,[431] and singer Selena Gomez's account was used by the hackers to post naked photos of her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber. The company admitted that \"we cannot determine which specific accounts may have been impacted\", but believed that \"it was a low percentage of Instagram accounts\", though *TechCrunch* stated in its report that six million accounts were affected by the hack, and that \"Instagram services more than 700 million accounts; six million is not a small number\".[433]\n\n\nIn 2019, Apple pulled an app that let users stalk people on Instagram by scraping accounts and collecting data.[434]\n\n\nIran has DPI blocking for Instagram.[435]\n\n\n\n### Content ownership[edit]\n\n\nOn December 17, 2012, Instagram announced a change to its Terms of Service policy, adding the following sentence:[436]\n\n\n\n\n> To help us deliver interesting paid or sponsored content or promotions, you agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata), and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.\n> \n> \n\n\nThere was no option for users to opt out of the changed Terms of Service without deleting their accounts before the new policy went into effect on January 16, 2013.[437] The move garnered severe criticism from users,[438][439] prompting Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom to write a blog post one day later, announcing that they would \"remove\" the offending language from the policy. Citing misinterpretations about its intention to \"communicate that we'd like to experiment with innovative advertising that feels appropriate on Instagram\", Systrom also stated that it was \"our mistake that this language is confusing\" and that \"it is not our intention to sell your photos\". Furthermore, he wrote that they would work on \"updated language in the terms to make sure this is clear\".[440][438]\n\n\nThe policy change and its backlash caused competing photo services to use the opportunity to \"try to lure users away\" by promoting their privacy-friendly services,[441] and some services experienced substantial gains in momentum and user growth following the news.[442] On December 20, Instagram announced that the advertising section of the policy would be reverted to its original October 2010 version.[443] *The Verge* wrote about that policy as well, however, noting that the original policy gives the company right to \"place such advertising and promotions on the Instagram Services or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content\", meaning that \"Instagram has always had the right to use your photos in ads, almost any way it wants. We could have had the exact same freakout last week, or a year ago, or the day Instagram launched\".[436]\n\n\nThe policy update also introduced an arbitration clause, which remained even after the language pertaining to advertising and user content had been modified.[444]\n\n\n\n### Facebook acquisition as a violation of US antitrust law[edit]\n\n\nColumbia Law School professor Tim Wu has given public talks explaining that Facebook's 2012 purchase of Instagram was a felony.[445] On February 26, 2019, the *New York Post* released an article stating that the FTC had discovered a memo authored by a senior Facebook official, revealing that the purpose behind the acquisition of Instagram was to remove a potential rival. Wu explains this is a violation of US antitrust law (see monopoly). Wu stated that this document was an email directly from Mark Zuckerberg, whereas the Post article had stated that their source had declined to say whether the high-ranking executive was the CEO. The article reported that the FTC \"has formed a task force to review \"anticompetitive conduct\" in the tech world amid concerns that tech companies are growing too powerful. The task force will look at \"the full panoply of remedies\" if it finds \"competitive harm,\" FTC competition bureau director Bruce Hoffman told reporters.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Algorithmic advertisement with a rape threat[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Olivia Solon, a reporter for *The Guardian*, posted a screenshot to her Instagram profile of an email she had received containing threats of rape and murder towards her. The photo post had received three likes and countless comments, and in September 2017, the company's algorithms turned the photo into an advertisement visible to Solon's sister. An Instagram spokesperson apologized and told *The Guardian* that \"We are sorry this happened – it's not the experience we want someone to have. This notification post was surfaced as part of an effort to encourage engagement on Instagram. Posts are generally received by a small percentage of a person's Facebook friends.\" As noted by the technology media, the incident occurred at the same time parent company Facebook was under scrutiny for its algorithms and advertising campaigns being used for offensive and negative purposes.[446][447]\n\n\n\n### Human exploitation[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2021, *The Washington Post* published a report detailing a \"black market\" of unlicensed employment agents luring migrant workers from Africa and Asia into indentured servitude as maids in Persian Gulf countries, and using Instagram posts containing their personal information (including in some cases, passport numbers) to market them. Instagram deleted 200 accounts that had been reported by the *Post*, and a spokesperson stated that Instagram took this activity \"extremely seriously\", disabled 200 accounts found by the *Post* to be engaging in these activities, and was continuing to work on systems to automatically detect and disable accounts engaging in human exploitation.[448]\n\n\n\n### July 2022 Updates[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Instagram announced a set of updates which immediately received widespread backlash from its userbase. The changes included a feed more focused on Instagram's content algorithms, full-screen photo and video posts, and changing the format of all of its videos to Reels. The primary criticisms for these updates was Instagram being more like TikTok, instead of photo sharing. The backlash originated from an Instagram post and Change.org petition created by photographer Tati Bruening (under the username @illumitati) on July 23, 2022, featuring the statement \"Make Instagram Instagram again. (stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends.) Sincerely, everyone.\". The post and petition gained mainstream attention after influencers Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian reposted the Instagram post; subsequently, the original post gained over 2 million likes on Instagram and over 275,000 signatures on Change.org.[449][450][451] Instagram walked back the update on July 28, with Meta saying \"We recognize that changes to the app can be an adjustment, and while we believe that Instagram needs to evolve as the world changes, we want to take the time to make sure we get this right.\"[452] Despite repeated attempts by Meta to shape Instagram to appear and operate more like TikTok, user engagement continued to lag far behind its rival as of 2022.[196]\n\n\n\n## Censorship and restricted content[edit]\n\n\n### Illicit drugs[edit]\n\n\nInstagram has been the subject of criticism due to users publishing images of drugs they are selling on the platform. In 2013, the BBC discovered that users, mostly located in the United States, were posting images of drugs they were selling, attaching specific hashtags, and then completing transactions via instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp. Corresponding hashtags have been blocked as part of the company's response and a spokesperson engaged with the BBC explained:[453][454]\n\n\n\n\n> Instagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the site. We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, video or comment, so we can take action. People can't buy things on Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos.\n> \n> \n\n\nHowever, new incidents of illegal drug trade have occurred in the aftermath of the 2013 revelation, with Facebook, Inc., Instagram's parent company, asking users who come across such content to report the material, at which time a \"dedicated team\" reviews the information.[455]\n\n\nIn 2019, Facebook announced that influencers are no longer able to post any vape, tobacco products, and weapons promotions on Facebook and Instagram.[456]\n\n\n\n### Women's bodies[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2013, Instagram deleted the account of Canadian photographer Petra Collins after she posted a photo of herself in which a very small area of pubic hair was visible above the top of her bikini bottom. Collins claimed that the account deletion was unfounded because it broke none of Instagram's terms and conditions.[457] Audra Schroeder of *The Daily Dot* further wrote that \"Instagram's terms of use state users can't post 'pornographic or sexually suggestive photos.'\" You can indeed find more sexually suggestive photos on the site than Collins', where women show the side of \"femininity\" the world is \"used to\" seeing and accepting.\"[458] Nick Drewe of *The Daily Beast* wrote a report the same month focusing on hashtags that users are unable to search for, including #sex, #bubblebutt, and #ballsack, despite allowing #faketits, #gunsforsale and #sexytimes, calling the discrepancy \"nonsensical and inconsistent\".[459]\n\n\nSimilar incidents occurred in January 2015, when Instagram deleted Australian fashion agency Sticks and Stones Agency's account because of a photograph including pubic hair sticking out of bikini bottoms,[460] and March 2015, when artist and poet Rupi Kaur's photos of menstrual blood on clothing were removed, prompting a rallying post on her Facebook and Tumblr accounts with the text \"We will not be censored\", gaining over 11,000 shares.[461]\n\n\nThe incidents have led to a #FreetheNipple campaign, aimed at challenging Instagram's removal of photos displaying women's nipples. Although Instagram has not made many comments on the campaign,[462] an October 2015 explanation from CEO Kevin Systrom highlighted Apple's content guidelines for apps published through its App Store, including Instagram, in which apps must designate the appropriate age ranking for users, with the app's current rating being 12+ years of age. However, this statement has also been called into question due to other apps with more explicit content allowed on the store, the lack of consequences for men exposing their bodies on Instagram, and for inconsistent treatment of what constitutes inappropriate exposure of the female body.[463][464]\n\n\nThe Iranian government offered moderators bribes up to $9,000 to delete specific accounts, with Masih Alinejad being targeted in particular.[465]\n\n\n\n### Censorship by countries[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(December 2021)*\n |\n\nCensorship of Instagram has occurred in several different countries.\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nOn January 11, 2020, Instagram and its parent company Facebook, Inc. are removing posts \"that voice support for slain Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani to comply with US sanctions\".[466]\n\n\nOn October 30, 2020, Instagram temporarily removed the \"recent\" tab on hashtag pages to prevent the spread of misinformation regarding the 2020 United States presidential election.[467] On January 7, 2021, United States President Donald Trump was banned from Instagram \"indefinitely\". Zuckerberg stated \"We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.\"[468]\n\n\nA few days after Facebook changed its name to Meta, an Australian artist and technologist, Thea-Mai Baumann, had lost access to her @metaverse Instagram handle. Bauman tried to reclaim her access for a month, without success. Only after *The New York Times* published the story and contacted Meta's PR department, was the access restored.[469]\n\n\n\n#### China[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Internet censorship in China\n\nInstagram has been blocked by China following the 2014 Hong Kong protests as many confrontations with police and incidents occurring during the protests were recorded and photographed. Hong Kong and Macau were not affected as they are part of special administrative regions of China.[470]\n\n\n\n#### Turkey[edit]\n\n\nTurkey is also known for its strict Internet censorship and periodically blocks social media including Instagram.[471]\n\n\n\n#### North Korea[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Internet in North Korea\n\nA few days after a fire incident that happened in the Koryo Hotel in North Korea on June 11, 2015, authorities began to block Instagram to prevent photos of the incident from being spread out.[472]\n\n\n\n#### Iran[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Internet censorship in Iran\n\nAs of September 2022, Instagram was one of the last freely available global social media sites in Iran.[473] Instagram is popular among Iranians because it is seen as an outlet for freedom and a \"window to the world.\"[474]\nStill, Iran has sentenced several citizens to prison for posts made on their Instagram accounts.[475] The Iranian government also blocked Instagram periodically during anti-government protests.[476] In July 2021, Instagram temporarily censored videos with the phrase \"death to Khamenei\".[477]\n\n\nIt was blocked along with WhatsApp permanently from September 2022 except for tourists and corporations who are asking for it.[478][479]\n\n\n\n#### Cuba[edit]\n\n\nThe Cuban government blocked access to several social media platforms, including Instagram, to curb the spread of information during the 2021 Cuban protests.[480]\n\n\n\n#### Russia[edit]\n\n\nOn March 11, 2022, Russia announced it would ban Instagram due to alleged \"calls for violence against Russian troops\" on the platform during the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[481] On March 14, the ban took effect, with almost 80 million users losing access to Instagram.[482]\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\nAs of January 7, 2023, the most followed person is Portuguese professional footballer Cristiano Ronaldo with over 530 million followers.[483] As of January 7, 2023, the most-liked photo on Instagram is a carousel of photos from footballer Lionel Messi celebrating winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup, The post has over 74 million likes.[484]\n\n\nIn 2022, Instagram was the second most downloaded mobile app of the year.[485]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* *Social Animals* (documentary film): A documentary film about three teenagers growing up on Instagram\n* Instagram model: a term for models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on Instagram\n* Instapoetry: a style of poetry which formed by sharing images of short poems by poets on Instagram.\n* Instagram Pier: a cargo working area in Hong Kong that gained its nickname due to its popularity on Instagram\n\n\n## System[edit]\n\n\nInstagram is written in Python.[486]\n\n\nInstagram artificial intelligence (AI) describes content for visually impaired people who use screen readers.[487]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* List of social networking services\n* Criticism of Facebook\n* Dronestagram\n* Internet celebrity\n* Instagram husband\n* Instagram face\n* Pheed\n* Pixnet\n* Social media and suicide\n* Timeline of social media\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The name is often colloquially abbreviated as **IG**, **Insta**, or **the Gram**,[6] legally Instagram, LLC,[7][8] also known as Instagram, Inc.[9][10]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Instagram\". *Instagram*.

Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44 billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.\n\n\nIn July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 27, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp. Musk promptly fired several top executives, including previous CEO Parag Agrawal. Musk has since proposed several reforms to Twitter and laid off half of the company's workforce. Hundreds of employees then resigned from the company after Musk issued an ultimatum demanding they commit to \"extremely hardcore\" work. Linda Yaccarino was appointed CEO of X Corp. In June 2023, the Twitter service was rebranded as X.\n\n\nReactions to the buyout were mixed, with praise for Musk's planned reforms and vision for the company, particularly his calls for greater free speech, but criticism over fears of a potential rise in misinformation and disinformation, harassment, and hate speech on the platform. Within the United States, conservatives have largely supported the acquisition, while many liberals and former Twitter employees have voiced concerns about Musk's intentions. Since becoming owner, Musk has faced backlash for his handling of the company and account suspensions, including the December 2022 suspensions of ten journalists.\n\n\n\n\n## Prelude[edit]\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Elon Musk § Twitter\n\n![](image)\nJack Dorsey, founder\n![](image)\nParag Agrawal, CEO\n![](image)\nBret Taylor, board of directors chair\nElon Musk communicated with Dorsey, Agrawal, and Taylor prior to proposing a buyout of Twitter Inc.\n\nBusiness magnate Elon Musk published his first tweet on his personal Twitter account in June 2010,[1] and had more than 80 million followers by April 2022.[2] In 2017, in response to a tweet suggesting that he buy Twitter, Inc., Musk replied, \"How much is it?\"[3] On March 24, 2022, Musk began tweeting criticisms of Twitter,[4] polling his followers on whether the company adhered to the principle that \"free speech is essential to a functioning democracy\".[5] Days later, he discussed the future of social media with Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey and explored the possibility of joining Twitter's board of directors with private equity firm Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban. He relayed this idea to Twitter board chair Bret Taylor and CEO Parag Agrawal, proposing to either take the company private or start a rival social media platform.[6] Dorsey responded to Musk with a text message, saying he hoped Twitter could become open-sourced and that he had unsuccessfully pushed for Musk's induction into Twitter's board a year earlier, a move that had prompted his departure from his role as CEO.[7]\n\n\n\n### Early developments[edit]\n\n\nMusk began purchasing Twitter stock on January 31, 2022.[4] On April 4, he announced that he had acquired 9.2 percent of the company's shares totaling $2.64 billion,[8] making him the company's largest shareholder.[9] Following the announcement, Twitter's stock experienced its largest intraday surge since the company's initial public offering (IPO) in 2013, rising by as much as 27 percent.[10] The next day, Twitter invited Musk to join the company's board,[11] which Musk accepted.[12] This had been recommended to the board by Twitter's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee three days earlier, with some board members expressing concern about potential \"adverse impacts on stockholder value\".[6] The position would have prohibited Musk from going beyond a 14.9 percent ownership stake and limited his ability to speak publicly about the company.[13][6] That day, Musk phoned Dorsey, who declined Musk's suggestion for him to remain on the board.[6]\n\n\nOn April 11, after publishing several tweets critical of the company, Musk announced he had decided not to join the board.[14] Instead, he informed Twitter that he intended to make an offer to take the company private. On April 12, Twitter's board met with lawyers and financial advisors to deliberate the ramifications of such a deal as well as their options,[6] while a company shareholder sued Musk for allegedly manipulating the company's stock price and violating Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules.[15]\n\n\n\n## Buyout offer[edit]\n\n\n### Takeover bid[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \n> \n> |  |  |  |\n> | --- | --- | --- |\n> | ![](image)\n>  | Elon Musk ![](image) | ![Twitter logo, a stylized blue bird](image) |\n> | @elonmusk |\n> \n> \n> I made an offer  \n> https://sec.gov/Archives/edgar...\n> \n> April 14, 2022[16]\n> \n>\n\nOn April 14, Musk made an unsolicited and non-binding offer to Twitter to purchase the company for $43 billion, or $54.20 per share, and take it private.[17] Though the offer was made to company management, the bid was described as a hostile takeover attempt because of the implied threat to purchase the outstanding stock if management declined.[18][19] The board responded that it would \"carefully review the proposal\".[20] After making the offer, Musk spent the night playing the video game *Elden Ring* to alleviate his stress.[21]\n\n\nIn a TED interview, Musk said he aimed to make Twitter a \"platform for free speech around the globe\", hailing free speech a \"societal imperative for a functioning democracy\" and insisting that he had not made the offer to increase his wealth.[22][23] Critics noted that he showed more interest in altering Twitter's moderation policies than in fighting government censorship.[24] According to *The Washington Post*, the banning of accounts such as *The Babylon Bee* had prompted Musk to initiate the acquisition.[25] The price of $54.20 per share is believed to be a reference to 420, a slang term in cannabis culture for marijuana consumption.[26]\n\n\nOn April 15, Twitter's board of directors announced a \"poison pill\" strategy which would allow shareholders to purchase additional stock in the event of a hostile takeover; the plan expired on April 14, 2023.[27] On April 17, Taylor was urged by Twitter's largest institutional shareholders to \"seriously consider\" the offer.[6] On April 20, Musk disclosed that he had secured financing provided by a group of banks led by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Barclays, MUFG, Société Générale, Mizuho Bank, and BNP Paribas, for a potential tender offer to acquire the company.[28][29] The funding included $7 billion of senior secured bank loans; $6 billion in subordinated debt; $6.25 billion in bank loans to Musk personally, secured by $62.5 billion of his Tesla stock; $20 billion in cash equity from Musk, to be provided by sales of Tesla stock and other assets; and $7.1 billion in equity from 19 independent investors.[30][31][32]\n\n\nThe initially proposed $13 billion in money borrowed by Twitter was equivalent to seven times the company's 2022 projected operating cash flow; some banks found that multiple too risky and opted to participate only in the $12.5 billion margin loan to Musk.[33] The debt was estimated to cost Twitter approximately $1 billion in annual interest and fees.[28] Two days after announcing his bid, Musk registered three holding companies under the name \"X Holdings\" in preparation for his takeover.[34] Tesla shares fell 12 percent on the day after the acquisition was announced, amid smaller declines in the broader markets. Musk incurred a $21 billion paper loss that day.[35]\n\n\n\n### Acquisition announcement[edit]\n\n\nOn April 23, Musk informed Taylor that his offer was \"best and final\", urging him to accept in a letter sent the following day.[6] Multiple outlets subsequently reported that Twitter was in final negotiations to accept Musk's offer, with a deal expected to be reached by the next day,[36][37][38] though Reuters cautioned that the deal could still fall apart.[39] On April 25, Twitter shares rose by 5 percent following reports that Twitter was poised to accept Musk's offer.[40] Twitter advisors Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase approved of the deal, deeming it fair from a financial perspective.[6] Twitter's board publicly and unanimously accepted the buyout offer for $44 billion, and Twitter was to become a private company once the transaction was completed sometime in 2022.[41][42] Negotiations with Musk were led by the board's transaction committee, composed of Taylor, Martha Lane Fox, and Patrick Pichette.[43] The deal would require shareholder and regulatory approval before it could be finalized,[44] though analysts believed it was unlikely to be challenged by regulators.[45]\n\n\nMusk was barred from disparaging the company or its employees when tweeting about the acquisition before the transaction closed.[46] The agreement also stipulated that if Musk failed to close the acquisition, he would be required to pay Twitter a $1 billion breakup fee.[47][48] Agrawal was set to receive $39 million from the buyout, while Dorsey would receive $978 million.[49] Musk had privately selected a new CEO to replace Agrawal upon completion of the acquisition,[33] though he was expected to serve as interim CEO in the months after its completion.[50] Tesla's stock sank by more than $125 billion the next market day, causing Musk to lose about $30 billion of his net worth.[51][52] Within three days after Twitter agreed to be acquired, Musk had sold $8.5 billion of his Tesla shares.[53]\n\n\nAfter the acceptance was announced, Musk said that his first goal would be to make the algorithm that ranks tweets in the content feed open-sourced, in an effort to increase transparency. He has also stated that he intended to remove spambots and \"authenticate all real humans\",[54] suggesting that he might convert Twitter's San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter.[55][56] Musk said he lacked confidence in Twitter's corporate management,[57] telling banks that he had considered reducing executive and board pay.[33] He published tweets critical of decisions made by Twitter executives such as Vijaya Gadde,[58] who was subsequently harassed by Twitter users using racist and sexist language.[59][60] On April 28, Twitter told advertising agencies that their work would not be seen next to offensive material.[61] Musk also discussed with bankers with the ideas of cutting jobs and costs, encouraging influencers to be creative, and adding subscription services to Twitter.[62][63]\n\n\nOn May 4, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom summoned Musk to discuss the effect of his buyout on free speech and \"online harms\".[64] Musk secured another $7.1 billion in funding the next day, including from Oracle Corporation co-founder Larry Ellison, Saudi prince Al Waleed bin Talal Al Saud, venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, as well as sovereign wealth fund Qatar Holding.[65][66] The equity infusion reduced his original $12.5 billion personal bank loan to $6.25 billion and his required cash equity contribution from $21 billion to just under $20 billion.[32][67] On May 11, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that the SEC and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had launched investigations into events leading to the acquisition.[68] The next day, Agrawal fired Twitter general manager Kayvon Beykpour and revenue product lead Bruce Falck.[69]\n\n\n\n## Attempted termination[edit]\n\n\n### Alleged hold[edit]\n\n\nOn May 13, Musk revealed that he had placed the deal \"on hold\" in the wake of reports that 5 percent of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts,[70] causing Twitter shares to drop more than 10 percent.[71] Musk clarified that he remained committed to the acquisition,[72] and Agrawal stated he expected the deal to close.[73] In response to a May 16 Twitter thread in which Agrawal said an external review into the platform's users was impractical, Musk tweeted out a poop emoji.[74] The following day, Musk reiterated that the acquisition could not \"move forward\" until Twitter could prove the aforementioned reports false,[75][76] urging the SEC to investigate Twitter's daily user numbers.[77] The same day, Twitter filed new documents with the SEC, including a detailed timeline of Musk's purchase,[6] and affirmed they would \"enforce the merger agreement\" regardless of Musk's actions.[78] On May 25, Musk abandoned plans to partially fund the deal through margin loans against Tesla stock, instead opting to pledge an additional $6.25 billion in equity financing.[79][80] Dorsey departed Twitter's board the same day,[81] while Twitter investor William Heresniak filed a class-action lawsuit against Musk, alleging that he had violated corporate laws in California by manipulating the market.[82] The lawsuit further declared that Musk was not permitted by the acquisition contract to place the deal on hold, and that Musk's misleading statements had contributed to declining Twitter stock prices.[83][84]\n\n\n\n![](image)Former Twitter security chief Peiter Zatko claimed that the company had misled the public on its privacy and security woes.\nOn June 3, the acquisition was cleared by U.S. antitrust review.[85] In an email sent by Musk's attorney to Twitter three days later, Musk threatened to terminate his agreement with Twitter because the company had refused to give him data pertaining to its users.[86][87] Twitter responded that they would continue to cooperate with Musk to ensure that the transaction was closed in accordance with their agreement.[88] On June 8, Twitter's board complied with Musk's demands, agreeing to provide him with a \"firehose\" data stream of tweets.[89][90] A week later, the SEC asked Agrawal to provide information on how Twitter estimated its number of spam accounts, to which the company obliged; the SEC concluded its inquiry on July 27.[91][92] Musk attended an all-hands meeting on June 16 to answer questions from Twitter employees,[93] discussing Twitter's content moderation policy, freedom of speech, potential layoffs, remote work, and \"the cosmic nature of Twitter\".[94][95][96] Musk also expressed his desire for Twitter to reach one billion active users,[97] and pledged his commitment to advertising as a source of revenue for Twitter.[98]\n\n\nIn a complaint filed by Whistleblower Aid with the SEC, U.S. Justice Department, and FTC on July 6, former Twitter security officer Peiter Zatko accused several Twitter executives, including Agrawal and certain board members, of making false or misleading statements about privacy, security, and content moderation on the platform in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 and SEC disclosure rules. These included misrepresentations to Musk made during the course of the acquisition bid, with the complaint specifically calling Agrawal's May 16 thread deceptive.[99][100][101] In a July 7 conference call, Twitter revealed that over one million spam accounts were removed daily, and reiterated that it was impossible to externally determine the exact number of these accounts as it would involve private user data.[102] That same day, *The Washington Post* reported that the deal was \"in peril\" amid a slowdown in discussions on funding.[103]\n\n\n\n### Attempted withdrawal by Musk[edit]\n\n\nOn July 8, Musk announced his intention to terminate the proposed acquisition, claiming in a regulatory filing that Twitter was in \"material breach\" of several parts of the agreement by refusing to comply with Musk's requests for spambot account data and dismissing high-ranking employees.[104][105] In response, Taylor pledged to pursue legal action against Musk at the Delaware Court of Chancery with the goal of completing the acquisition,[106][107] with the ensuing lawsuit once again overseen by the Twitter board's transaction committee.[43] Twitter's stock sank by 7 percent after the news, dropping by a further 11 percent the next day.[108] On July 10, Twitter hired the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz to represent its case, including \"key lawyers\" William Savitt and Leo Strine,[109] along with Potter Anderson & Corroon, Ballard Spahr, Kobre & Kim, and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.[110] Musk again employed the services of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan after previously doing so for *Unsworth v. Musk* and *SEC v. Musk*,[109] including his personal lawyer Alex Spiro, as well as Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.[111]\n\n\nTwitter formally launched its lawsuit against Musk at the Delaware Court of Chancery on July 12,[111] with Musk tweeting in response, \"Oh the irony lol\".[112] Twitter requested that the trial be held from September 19 through September 22,[113] before the deal's originally scheduled \"drop dead\" date on October 24.[114] Musk's legal team objected to this, asking for the trial to be held from February 13 through February 22, 2023.[115] On July 19, judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled that the trial would last for five days in October,[116][117] with Twitter seeking an October 10 start date.[118] During its quarterly earnings investor call on July 22, Twitter cited the \"chaos\" caused by the proposal as the primary factor for its decline in revenue.[119] In a letter to McCormick on July 26, Musk's lawyers complained that Twitter had hindered them from commencing the discovery process and requested an October 17 start date,[118] which McCormick granted three days later with a duration of five days.[120]\n\n\nIn a tweet on August 6, Musk challenged Agrawal to a public debate on Twitter's spambot accounts, before polling his followers on whether they believed that less than 5 percent of Twitter accounts were \"fake/spam\".[121] On August 10, Musk sold 7.92 million Tesla shares worth a total of $6.9 billion as backup should he lose the lawsuit, despite previously stating he would no longer sell Tesla stock.[122] The next week, McCormick ordered Twitter to produce documents from Beykpour, which Musk's team had requested along with files from 22 other Twitter employees and 41 \"custodians\".[123] Shortly thereafter, Musk subpoenaed Dorsey.[124] Other businessmen and investors subpoenaed include Marc Andreessen, Ellison, David Sacks, and Joe Lonsdale, while Twitter and Musk also subpoenaed Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Salesforce, Mastercard, and more. Sacks and Lonsdale were both irritated that they were being subpoenaed, with the former filing a failed motion to dismiss the subpoena. In total, lawyers for Twitter issued over 84 subpoenas, while Musk's lawyers issued more than 36.[110]\n\n\nFacing increasing pressure from Musk, Twitter announced that it would combine its health team, tasked with preventing non-consensual nudity and child sexual exploitation on the platform, with its anti-spam team.[125] McCormick rejected much of Musk's team's \"absurdly broad\" request for data pertaining to all of Twitter's users, but ordered the company to produce data from 9,000 accounts it previously audit sampled.[126] Musk filed a \"termination letter\" with the SEC on August 29, citing Zatko's claims as evidence Twitter breached their contract,[127][128] before asking McCormick to delay the trial by a few weeks.[129] McCormick rejected the request,[130] and Musk's team sent a third termination letter to Twitter.[131] On September 13, Zatko testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee,[132][133][134] while Twitter shareholders voted in favor of the acquisition.[135][136] Musk privately offered to purchase Twitter at the reduced prices of $31 billion and $39.6 billion, both of which the company rejected.[137][138]\n\n\n\n## Revival and closure[edit]\n\n\n### Revitalization of bid[edit]\n\n\nOn October 3, Musk's legal team informed Twitter that Musk had changed his mind and decided to move forward with his proposed acquisition at the originally agreed-upon price of $54.20 per share, on the condition that Twitter drop its lawsuit.[139] The reason for this reversal was attributed to concerns from Musk's team that they would not be able to prove that there was a material adverse effect justifying a break from contract. Musk and Agrawal's depositions were originally scheduled for October 6 and 10, respectively.[140] Musk stated that his purchase of Twitter was part of his ambition to create an \"everything app\" called X, which would offer many different services.[141] In response, McCormick asked both sides to propose to her how they should proceed. Twitter shares surged by 23 percent as a result of Musk's announcement.[140] Neither Twitter nor Musk responded to McCormick's request, prompting her to announce that the trial would go forward as planned.[142]\n\n\nOn October 6, McCormick agreed to a request by Musk to postpone the trial to October 28 so Musk could finalize his debt financing for the acquisition, adding that the trial would be rescheduled to November if the deal did not close by then.[143][144] During this time, Musk deposited a $1 billion loan from his company SpaceX, paying back the loan with interest the following month.[145][146] On October 13, court filings revealed that Musk was being investigated by the U.S. government for his conduct in the proposed buyout.[147][148] Musk later stated that he believed Twitter's long-term value would exceed the price of $54.20 per share, which he considered an overpayment.[149] On October 20, *The Washington Post* reported that Musk intended to terminate 75 percent of Twitter's staff, and that Twitter executives were keen on selling the company to Musk so they could mitigate their planned payroll and infrastructure cuts.[150][151] In an open letter, Twitter employees condemned Musk's intentions and warned of negative consequences on the future of Twitter.[152][153] Bloomberg News and the *Post* further reported that officials in the Biden administration were considering a national security review of Musk's proposed acquisition and other ventures via the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS),[154][155] with the possibility of U.S. President Joe Biden blocking the purchase if need be;[156] the White House denied the reports.[157][158]\n\n\nBy October 21, both parties' bankers and lawyers were set to complete the paperwork for the acquisition by the end of the month, with the deal expected to close by then.[159][160] The banks funding the acquisition were to hold the $13 billion worth of debt incurred as opposed to selling it.[161][162] In a video call with banks who helped Musk fund the acquisition, Musk assured them he would complete the buyout by the deadline.[163] Musk made a trip to Twitter's headquarters on October 26, tweeting a video of him carrying a kitchen sink at the site's lobby and changing his Twitter bio to \"Chief Twit\".[164][165][166] Musk also told Twitter employees that while layoffs were still likely to happen, he did not intend to do so at the scale the *Post* had previously reported.[167][168] The next day, Musk wrote in an open letter to advertisers that Twitter would not become a \"free-for-all hellscape\", reiterating that his motives for the purchase were not based on greed but rather a desire to create \"a common digital town square\".[169] He then asked Tesla engineers to meet with Twitter's product managers in order to assess the platform's codebase,[170] which was frozen until November 1.[171]\n\n\n\n### Completion of purchase[edit]\n\n\nIn the afternoon of October 27, Musk and Twitter closed the deal, with Musk tweeting \"the bird is freed\". Musk immediately became Twitter's new owner, promptly firing Agrawal, chief financial officer (CFO) Ned Segal, Gadde, and general counsel Sean Edgett,[172][173][174] with the executives escorted out of the company's headquarters by security.[175] This move came to the surprise of many involved, who had expected Musk to allow the executives to voluntarily resign; Agrawal had prepared a draft of his resignation letter before his access to his Twitter email account was cut off. According to Walter Isaacson's biography *Elon Musk* (2023), Musk \"meticulously\" changed his plans so \"he could terminate their employment before their stock options would vest\", seeking retribution for Agrawal's handling of the spambot incident.[176] Agrawal, Segal, and Gadde were set to receive \"golden parachute\" sums of $38.7 million, $25.4 million, and $12.5 million, respectively,[177][178] but *The New York Times* reported that Musk was unlikely to make the payments because the executives had been dismissed for cause.[179] According to the *Financial Times*, Musk's justification for this assertion was that the company had been mismanaged, and the executives were \"weighing their legal options over the decision\".[180] Dorsey retained his $1 billion ownership stake,[181][182] and several other executives departed Twitter in the ensuing days.[183][184][185]\n\n\nMusk assumed the position of CEO,[186][187] merging the company with X Holdings and dissolving Twitter's board of directors.[188] With this merger, Twitter ceased to be an independent company, with X Corp. later created in March 2023 to house the company.[189][190] Musk uses the title \"Chief Twit\" to refer to his position as CEO.[191] A \"war room\" was established at Twitter, with Musk meeting with Spiro, Sacks, and others to discuss his next steps.[192] According to *The New York Times*, the group's two primary objectives were to reduce the size of Twitter's workforce and overhaul the platform's mobile app.[193] Twitter employees were not formally informed of the change in management,[194] with Musk originally said to be planning a town hall meeting with employees but ultimately not doing so.[172][195] The next day, Twitter shares ceased trading in accordance with Musk's pledge to take the company private;[196][197][198] the company's stock ticker was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on November 8.[199]\n\n\n\n### Post-acquisition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Twitter under Elon Musk\n\n![](image)Musk appointed Linda Yaccarino CEO of X Corp., the successor to Twitter.\nSince becoming owner, Musk has enacted a series of reforms, including overhauling Twitter's verification system by requiring new applicants to purchase a Twitter Blue subscription.[200] Many Twitter staff members were directed to extend their working hours in order to meet Musk's deadlines for his desired changes to the platform.[201] On November 4, Musk laid off roughly half of Twitter's workforce,[202][203] and two weeks later, he issued an ultimatum to employees to commit to \"extremely hardcore\" work in order to realize Musk's vision of \"Twitter 2.0\", or leave.[204][205] Hundreds of employees resigned in response.[206][207]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Musk began restoring previously banned accounts such as Jordan Peterson, Kathy Griffin, *The Babylon Bee*, and Trump,[208][209] while suspending anti-fascist accounts at the urging of far-right figures,[210] as well as accounts that parodied Musk.[211][212] Musk also relaxed the platform's hate speech policies and removed its policy prohibiting COVID-19 misinformation,[213][214] resulting in an increase in hate speech.[215] In December, Musk faced backlash after banning ElonJet, a Twitter bot account operated by Jack Sweeney which tracked Musk's private jet in real-time using publicly accessible data.[216][217] These protests intensified when Musk suspended multiple journalists who had been covering the ElonJet incident.[218][219][220] Days later, Musk conducted a Twitter poll asking users whether he should step down as CEO of Twitter,[221][222] to which voters responded in the affirmative.[223][224] Musk stated he would step down after selecting his replacement,[225] and he was succeeded by NBCUniversal advertising sales chair Linda Yaccarino in June 2023.[226]\n\n\nMusk's acquisition of Twitter was principally responsible for the development of Threads, a social media platform which closely resembles Twitter, by rival company Meta Platforms. Work began on the service in November 2022, and it was released on July 5, 2023, amidst continued backlash to changes to Twitter enacted by Musk and Yaccarino.[227][228] In response, Twitter threatened to sue Meta over intellectual property infringement.[229] Agrawal, Segal, and Gadde filed a lawsuit against Twitter in April 2023, claiming that the company had failed to pay them for the legal fees they had incurred during their tenure.[230] McCormick ruled in the executives' favor in October.[231]\n\n\nIn June, X Corp. sued Wachtell to recoup a portion of the $90 million fee the law firm had paid, accusing the firm of \"unjust enrichment\" for charging a bonus fee on successful completion of the acquisition when the agreement with prior Twitter management stipulated billing only on an hourly basis.[232][233] The Twitter app was rebranded as X in July, an unprecedented decision which has created confusion among users.[234] In September, Musk failed to appear before the SEC in response to the agency's investigation into his purchasing of Twitter stock the year prior, prompting a lawsuit.[235] *The Wall Street Journal* reported in October 2023 that the seven major banks that had provided Musk's acquisition loans failed to follow the standard practice of quickly selling down their exposure to other banks due to a lack of appetite for the debt since Musk took over, instead expected to mark down the debt by at least 15 percent in order to sell it.[236]\n\n\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n\n### Takeover bid[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Musk's induction to Twitter's board of directors on April 5, Agrawal wrote that he believed Musk's appointment would bring long-term value to the company, while Dorsey wrote that Musk \"cares deeply about our world and Twitter's role in it\".[12] Dorsey privately relayed his appreciation to Musk for his commitment, texting that he trusted Musk.[7] On April 11, Agrawal stated that he believed Musk's withdrawal from the board was \"for the best\", noting that the company would \"remain open to his input\".[14]\n\n\nMusk's offer to take over Twitter was met with both praise and criticism.[237] On April 14, Twitter employees expressed concern with Musk's views on free speech.[238][239] Media outlets expressed concerns that his proposed changes to Twitter would result in an increase in disinformation and online harassment.[237][240] Jim Cramer of CNBC opined that the Twitter board would have \"no choice\" but to reject Musk's offer due to potential personal liability faced by the board members.[241] On April 19, the National Urban League urged Twitter to turn down Musk's takeover bid, warning of potentially negative consequences on users' civil rights.[242]\n\n\nConservative and Republican commentators and politicians in the U.S. who believed Twitter discriminated against right-wing speech expressed enthusiasm for Musk's proposed changes.[237][243] On April 22, U.S. House Republicans demanded that Twitter's board preserve all records pertaining to Musk's takeover proposal, which sets the stage for a potential congressional probe following the 2022 midterms.[244] Jimmy Patronis, the Chief Financial Officer of Florida, praised Musk's offer and was critical of Twitter's \"poison pill\" strategy.[245] According to a poll conducted by Harvard University's Center for American Political Studies (CAPS) and the Harris Poll, 57 percent of American voters approved of Musk's purchase of Twitter.[246]\n\n\n\n### Acquisition announcement[edit]\n\n\nAgrawal applauded the purchase and assured employees that no layoffs were planned at that time,[247][248] adding he was proud of Twitter employees \"despite the noise\" around the company.[58] He also led an all-hands meeting on April 29 to address concerns raised by employees.[249] Dorsey endorsed the sale, saying that \"taking [Twitter] back from Wall Street is the correct first step\" and that he trusted Musk to be the owner of the company.[250] Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo denounced Musk's criticism of the company.[58] Gadde allegedly cried during a meeting about the announcement and was subjected to online trolling.[251] Musk's June 17 meeting with employees was generally negatively received by participants, who found Musk's statements \"incoherent\" and \"uninspiring\".[252] Musk was repeatedly derided and mocked by Twitter employees on their internal Slack channels after the deal was brokered.[140]\n\n\nRepublican lawmakers in the U.S. Congress such as Jim Jordan, Yvette Herrell, Marsha Blackburn, and Ted Cruz praised the deal, calling it a restoration of free speech. Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers such as Pramila Jayapal, Jesús García, Marie Newman, Mark Pocan, and Elizabeth Warren criticized Musk and the buyout.[253][254] In June, Texas attorney general Ken Paxton launched an investigation into whether Twitter had misled authorities on its number of spambot accounts, alluding to prior claims made by Musk.[255] Former U.S. President Donald Trump expressed approval with the deal but stated that he would not rejoin the platform, even if he is unbanned, due to his preference for his own social media platform, Truth Social;[256] Musk later indicated his intention to reverse Twitter's ban on Trump.[257] Mexican President Lopez Obrador stated that he hoped Musk would rid Twitter of \"the corruption that's there, manipulation with bots\".[258] Federal Communications Commission (FCC) commissioner Brendan Carr responded to calls for the agency to block the purchase by saying that it has no authority to do so, calling such requests \"absurd\".[259] Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner for Internal Market, emphasized that \"any company operating in Europe needs to comply with [their] rules\", while the European Union (EU) announced that new online rules would \"overhaul\" the digital market and Tech Giants.[260]\n\n\nBy April 27, 30,000 new users had joined the decentralized network of servers running open-source Mastodon software.[261] Conservative Twitter accounts experienced a significant increase in followers, while liberal ones experienced a slight decrease;[262] additionally, thousands of left-leaning users deactivated their accounts following the buyout.[263] LGBTQ+ users and activists expressed apprehension about the deal based on tweets by Musk mocking transgender people, fearing that the re-platforming of suspended Twitter accounts would lead to a rise in online harassment and hate speech.[264][265] On June 3, a group of political advocacy groups which included the Center for Countering Digital Hate, GLAAD, and MediaJustice initiated a campaign to block the proposal by calling for a review of the deal by the government and a boycott of the platform by advertisers.[266]\n\n\nHenrik Fisker, co-founder of electric vehicle maker Fisker Inc. and a rival of Musk's, left Twitter shortly after the acquisition announcement.[267] Amazon founder Jeff Bezos questioned whether Tesla's business interest in China would give the Chinese government leverage over Twitter via Musk, before answering that it would \"probably not\".[268][269] Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates questioned if Musk would allow the spread of public health misinformation, including vaccine misinformation.[270] Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales speculated that Twitter could either thrive or fall within five years under Musk's supervision.[271] Bitcoin investor Roger Ver and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong welcomed the buyout, citing the potential for reduction of perceived censorship on Twitter.[272] Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said that he hoped Twitter would improve over time due to its importance to society,[273] while Facebook and Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed confusion and uncertainty over the proposed buyout.[274]\n\n\n\n### Attempted termination[edit]\n\n\nEdgett instructed employees not to share commentary on the purported cancellation; nonetheless, several Twitter employees posted humorous messages making light of the situation.[275] Tesla shares rose 2.11 percent in the hours after Musk's announcement.[276] Trump criticized Musk and called the acquisition \"rotten\",[277] which led to a protracted feud between the two.[278][279] With the exception of Trump, most conservatives sided with Musk, with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon attacking Twitter for allegedly lying about the prevalence of its spambot accounts and Turning Point USA CEO Charlie Kirk musing that Musk may have been seeking to \"expose\" Twitter the whole time.[280] In an email sent to Twitter's employees in response to Zatko's complaint, Agrawal sharply rejected the claims and called them a \"false narrative\".[281]\n\n\n\n### Completion of purchase[edit]\n\n\nTrump responded approvingly of the purchase after the deal was closed, saying that he was pleased Twitter was \"in sane hands\", rather than what he termed \"radical left lunatics\".[282][283] Other Republican politicians, including Dan Crenshaw, Darrell Issa,[284] Marjorie Taylor Greene,[285] Marsha Blackburn,[192] Anthony Sabatini, Amy Kremer,[286] Lauren Boebert, Dick Black,[287] Cruz,[288] and Jordan applauded the purchase as well. Democrat Amy Klobuchar voiced her distrust of Musk and called for tighter government regulation of the platform,[289] while Democrat Chris Murphy advocated for a federal investigation into the role of Saudi Arabia in the purchase.[290] Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia and former President of Russia, was pleased with the news, stating that he hoped Twitter would eliminate \"political bias and ideological dictatorship\". Breton again emphasized that Twitter was bound by the EU's laws,[291] alluding to the recently-passed Digital Services Act.[292]\n\n\nInternally, Twitter employees expressed concern that Musk would lay off employees before they receive their compensation payments,[178] among other messages criticizing Musk and voicing solidarity with each other.[287] Amid conflicting reports on whether Musk was planning sweeping layoffs, many employees expressed uncertainty and fear on Slack, Discord, and LinkedIn.[293][294] Women's rights activist Seyi Akiwowo tweeted her disappointment with Gadde's dismissal, while children's rights activist Beeban Kidron said that Musk's newfound power would not result in more free speech.[292] Podcaster Joe Rogan praised Musk for his aspirations,[289] while right-wing Twitter account Libs of TikTok rejoiced over the news of the purchase.[288] Media personality Stew Peters, who had been blocked from Twitter for months, attempted to circumvent the block after the purchase using a new account, which was later suspended.[287] Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the Russian state-controlled RT broadcasting service, demanded that Musk lift her Twitter suspension.[195] Bin Talal Al Saud congratulated Musk on the purchase,[287] and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon urged Musk to eradicate spambot accounts.[295] Tesla rival General Motors announced it would temporarily stop paid advertising on Twitter.[291] Advertising agencies IPG Mediabrands and Omnicom Media Group recommended their clients temporarily pause advertising on Twitter due to safety and trust concerns over Musk's ownership.[296][297] A slew of companies proceeded to do so, including Audi, Bentley, the Carlsberg Group, General Mills, Lamborghini, Mondelez International, Porsche, Pfizer, REI, and the Volkswagen Group.[298][299] Media buying agency GroupM also advised its clients against procuring advertisements from Twitter.[300] Alt-tech social media platform Parler welcomed Musk's purchase, while alt-tech platform Gettr was more skeptical, believing Twitter was \"fundamentally broken\".[301] Similarities have been drawn between the acquisition and the 2022 film *Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery*, with some viewers comparing Musk to the character of Miles Bron, though director Rian Johnson stated that the similarities were purely coincidental.[302][303]\n\n\nOnline reception to Musk's completion of the purchase was mixed.[304] According to Memetica, a digital investigations company, several far-right figures experienced a significant increase in followers after the deal was finalized, while many progressives experienced a significant decrease, although it is unclear if Musk's takeover drove the changes in followers.[305] Mastodon once again experienced a surge in sign-ups.[306] Multiple celebrities in the entertainment industry announced their departure from the platform,[307][308] while some left-wing influencers such as John Pavlovitz and Rob Reiner urged fellow leftists to remain on Twitter for the time being.[307][305] The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) observed a 500 percent spike in the use of the racial slur \"nigger\" in the 12 hours after Musk completed the acquisition, while *The Washington Post* noted an increase in pro-Nazi, misogynistic, and anti-LGBTQ+ tweets.[195] Basketball player LeBron James expressed concern over the NCRI's report, condemning \"unfit people saying hate speech is free speech\".[309] Twitter responded by saying that the accounts using racial slurs were part of a \"trolling campaign\" and would be banned summarily.[310][311] The Center for Countering Digital Hate reported that anti-Black, anti-gay, and anti-transgender slurs had increased since Musk took control of Twitter, while the Anti-Defamation League reported an increase in antisemitic content.[312]\n\n\n\n## Critical analysis[edit]\n\n\n### Takeover bid and acquisition announcement[edit]\n\n\nAnticipating a takeover, Elizabeth Lopatto of *The Verge* predicted that it would lead to a mass employee exodus and a possible reinstatement of Trump's Twitter account.[313] After the acquisition announcement, Alex Werpin of *The Hollywood Reporter* warned of widespread repercussions.[314] Greg Bensinger of *The New York Times* argued that Musk's acquisition was \"about controlling a megaphone\" rather than free speech,[315] while Elizabeth Dwoskin of *The Washington Post* remarked that Musk's free speech vision for Twitter was considered by technologists to be outdated and impractical.[316] Don Pittis of CBC News noted the controversy associated with the wealthy gaining control of media platforms.[317] Brendan O'Neill of *Spiked* observed that Musk's purchase of Twitter and the resulting backlash represented a \"battle for control of the Internet\",[318] with *Business Insider*'s Ben Gilbert calling the purchase the latest \"battleground\" in the culture war between Democrats and Republicans.[319] Michael Hiltzik of *The Seattle Times* commented that Musk's impact on Twitter would depend on his policies and how he chooses to implement them.[320] David Auerbach of *UnHerd* saw the purchase as indicative of a \"major flashpoint\" in the transition of society to \"a more decentralized, chaotic, and devolved world\".[321] Paul R. La Monica of CNN Business suggested that Tesla's declining stock price indicated that Wall Street investors were doubtful on whether Musk's purchase would go through.[322] *CleanTechnica*'s Matt Pressman believed that Musk's purchase would benefit Tesla because owners of the company's cars often engaged on the platform,[323] and Lindsey Bakes of *Deseret News* wrote that Musk could integrate cryptocurrency within Twitter.[324]\n\n\nKevin D. Williamson of American conservative magazine *National Review* likened Musk's purchase of Twitter to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign, labeling it a publicity stunt,[325] his colleague Rich Lowry said that liberal politicians' strong reaction to Musk's purchase was an indication that Twitter's existing policies had \"political consequences\",[326] and the editors of the publication wished Musk well in his quest to promote free speech on Twitter.[327] Bonnie Kristian of evangelical magazine *Christianity Today* felt that the purchase would only \"add to the confusion\" surrounding the contentious debate on free speech,[328] while Paris Marx of American socialist magazine *Jacobin* dismissed Musk's proclamations that he sought to protect free speech as an \"example of his hubris\".[329] Corbin K. Barthold of conservative public policy magazine *City Journal* believed it would be difficult but \"worth the struggle\" to end censorship on Twitter,[330] while Peter van Buren of *The Spectator World* opined that Musk should simply take Twitter offline.[331] Cathy Young of center-right news website *The Bulwark* felt that Musk's planned reforms to Twitter were \"unlikely to succeed\", further observing that commentators who opposed the purchase viewed it as right-wing backlash against \"perceived left-wing social media bias\".[332] Robby Soave of American libertarian magazine *Reason* postulated that Musk's purchase would not threaten Twitter or democracy, suggesting that those overstating the importance of the platform were \"Musk's critics in progressive and mainstream media\",[333] with James McElroy of *The American Conservative* further arguing that many journalists' condemnation of the acquisition was motivated by \"professional anxiety\".[334] J. Robert McClure III of American conservative magazine *Washington Examiner* and Ben Shapiro of American conservative news website *The Daily Signal* declared that the negative reaction to Musk's purchase was rooted in an opposition to the idea of free speech.[335][336]\n\n\nEquity analyst Angelo Zino believed that Twitter's acceptance of Musk's proposal may have stemmed from its realization that alternative bidders would be unlikely to emerge due to social media companies' declining asset prices.[57] Associate professor Brian Quinn of Boston College Law School noted that it would be difficult for Musk to arbitrarily pull out of the deal due to the contractual doctrines of fair dealing and good faith.[337] Kate Klonick, a law professor at St. John's University, argued that to allow \"all free speech\" to exist on Twitter would open the door to the spread of pornography and hate speech.[338] Similarly, Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, stated that the lack of moderation on Twitter would lead to online harassment.[339] Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former CEO of Medtronic, argued that Musk's purchase of Twitter would harm both society and Musk himself,[340] while analyst Mike Proulx of Forrester Research cautioned that other companies may leave Twitter if Musk loosens its moderation policies.[341] Proprietary trader Dennis Dick opined that Musk's spambot claims were tactics by him to lower the price of the purchase.[342] Analysts noted that the involvement of foreign entities as independent investors could cause the transaction to face national security scrutiny by the CFIUS.[343][344] Left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America and think tank Australian Strategic Policy Institute suggested that China could use its influence to extract political concessions or manipulate Twitter due to Musk's ties to the country.[345][346] American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) executive director Anthony D. Romero warned of the potential danger of Musk wielding excessive power.[347]\n\n\n\n### Attempted termination[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Musk's announcement that he intended to terminate the agreement, legal experts generally agreed it would be difficult for him to do so.[348] Law professor James Park of the University of California, Los Angeles found Musk's spambot argument weak and doubted it was material, while Case Western Reserve University business law professor Anat Alon-Beck observed that Twitter was compelled to enforce the merger so as to disprove Musk's allegations. Professor Jennifer Grygiel of Syracuse University mused that Musk may reverse course and revisit the deal.[349] Tulane University Law School associate dean for faculty research Ann Lipton and mergers and acquisitions expert Julian Klymochko both expressed doubts that Musk could prove there was a material adverse effect.[350][351]\n\n\nFelix Salmon of *Axios* noted that a clause in the contract opened the door for a judge to grant specific performance and order Musk to move forward with the deal.[352] CNBC's Jonathan Vanian described Musk's withdrawal as the product of months of buyer's remorse,[353] while his colleague Alex Sherman observed that paying the stipulated breakup fee would not relieve Musk of compensations or sanctions.[354] Writing for *The Wall Street Journal*, Holman W. Jenkins Jr. questioned whether Musk had proposed the acquisition \"out of mouth momentum or excessive enjoyment of the limelight or for some mysterious reason that causes an onlooker to throw up his hands\".[355] Various news publications believed that Zatko's complaint provided potential evidence in Musk's favor,[356][357][358] though Bloomberg News columnist Matt Levine argued that the complaint confirmed Twitter's monetizable daily active users counts do not include spambots.[359]\n\n\n\n### Revitalization of bid[edit]\n\n\nGreg Varallo of the Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann law firm observed that if Musk fails to secure funding and close the acquisition, he could be barred from claiming that he can terminate the acquisition as per the legal doctrine of judicial estoppel.[360] New York University's Center for Social Media and Politics executive director Zeve Sanderson cautioned that if Musk does lay off 75 percent of Twitter's workforce, it would make it more difficult for the company to moderate its content. Professor David Kaye of the University of California, Irvine School of Law and Professor Eric Goldman of the Santa Clara University School of Law concurred, warning of a potential increase in misinformation and harassment on the platform. However, they noted that the layoffs could still be mitigated through an increase in automated content moderation.[361]\n\n\n\n### Completion of purchase[edit]\n\n\nConservative commentators celebrated the purchase's closure.[285][288][362] Fox News host Tucker Carlson argued that Musk's *laissez-faire* approach to moderation on Twitter would reshape American political discourse.[362] Shapiro wrote that he hoped other social media platforms would implement Musk's proposals and called on Musk to reverse Peterson's suspension from Twitter.[285][288][362] Political commentator Matt Walsh saw the purchase as an opportunity to rally opposition against the \"trans agenda\".[195][362] Political columnist Benny Johnson called on Musk to reverse the suspensions of several prominent conservatives.[285] *Spiked*'s O'Neill claimed that liberals' negative reaction to the closure reflected their fear of freedom and liberty,[363] while *Washington Examiner*'s Christopher Tremoglie disapproved of Musk's idea for a moderation council as continued censorship.[364]\n\n\nLauren Hirsch of *The New York Times* observed that Musk would face financial challenges in owning Twitter, including the company's difficulty in turning a profit.[365] Richard Waters of the *Financial Times* echoed Hirsch's sentiments, adding that it would difficult for Musk to allow the right amount of free speech on the platform.[366] Kate Ferguson of Deutsche Welle viewed Musk as unreliable and therefore unfit to operate Twitter,[367] and Hamilton Nolan of *The Guardian* felt the purchase was an attempt by Musk to \"control the conversation\".[368] Barbara Ortutay, Tom Krisher and Matt O'Brien of the Associated Press noted Musk's contradictory and vague messages in the past regarding his vision for Twitter,[369] while Ben Burgis of *Jacobin* criticized liberals' technocratic views and their downplaying of the importance of free speech in response to the purchase, though he remarked that Musk had a history of suppressing his critics.[370] Also writing for *The New York Times*, Kate Conger, Ryan Mac, and Tiffany Hsu noted that Musk's meetings with civil rights activists and his plans for a content moderation council were reminiscent of the actions taken by Zuckerberg following backlash on Facebook's handling of the 2016 U.S. elections.[371] *Politico*'s Jack Shafer noted that media coverage of Musk's purchase foretold \"chaos, greater political oversight, and outright failure.\"[372]\n\n\nEdward Niedermeyer, an author and critic of Musk, argued that Twitter may fail due to Musk's hubris.[372] Scholars who studied the First Amendment, such as professor Jonathan Turley of the George Washington University Law School, praised Musk's plans to tone down content moderation on Twitter.[295] New York University's Center for Business and Human Rights deputy director Paul M. Barrett speculated that a moderation council under Musk would face skepticism due to Musk's \"erratic and imperious\" behavior in the past.[195] Alex Stamos of Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation questioned how Musk would respond to foreign governments attempting to influence Twitter's userbase.[195] Those in the cryptocurrency field, such as podcaster Bryce Paul and investor Cathie Wood, expressed excitement at the prospects of Musk's ownership.[295]\n\n\nMedia Matters for America president Angela Carusone warned that Musk's leadership would lead to an increase in disinformation, conspiracy theories, and harassment on Twitter.[373] Literary group PEN America opined that the midterm elections in November would serve as a test as to whether Musk would allow disinformation to spread rapidly on the platform,[374] while American left-wing activist coalition Stop the Deal warned of real-world consequences if a rise in hate speech occurs on Twitter.[291][195] Over 40 civil rights groups signed an open letter to 20 Twitter advertisers urging them to abandon the platform if Musk lifts its content moderation measures.[183] Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" about the purchase, but expressed concerns over a potential rise in hate speech.[373] Fight for the Future director Evan Greer appreciated Musk's idea for a moderation council, but noted that Musk had supreme authority on any decisions made.[192] Eliot Higgins of Bellingcat believed that Musk's attempts to promote free speech would backfire under increased government regulation.[284] LGBTQ+ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign voiced concern at Twitter's new ownership and argued that Twitter has the responsibility to stop its platform from turning into a \"dangerous media environment\".[195]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nOn the first anniversary of the acquisition, Musk valued the company at $19 billion, a 55 percent decrease from the buyout's $44 billion purchase price.[375][376] Fidelity, which contributed $300 million to the acquisition, depressed the value by 65 percent.[377] Statistics indicated a 30 percent decline in active users, 60 percent decline in advertising,[378] 14 percent decline in website traffic,[379] and 38 percent decline in app downloads.[380] The company has refuted these metrics, reporting an increase in engagement.[379] A nonfiction book about the acquisition, *Breaking Twitter: Elon Musk and the Most Controversial Corporate Takeover in History*, was announced by author Ben Mezrich in December 2022 and released in November 2023.[381][382]\n\n\nMany publications reflected on Twitter's first year under Musk's ownership. Journalists for *The Washington Post*, citing data from the University of Washington, wrote that the platform had \"become a cacophony of misinformation and confusing reports\", remarking on Twitter's stark shift toward conservatism.[383] Pranav Dixit of *The Guardian* lambasted the changes and reforms Musk had instituted in the past year,[384] while Miles Klee of *Rolling Stone* criticized Musk's alleged pandering to \"right-wing extremists and peddlers of misinformation\".[385] *The Verge*'s Jay Peters pointed to Musk's radical changes and declining user numbers as evidence that the takeover was a \"disaster\",[386] while Bloomberg's Aisha Counts zeroed in on the increase in misinformation and hate speech.[387] Kate Conger of *The New York Times* and Alex Kirshner of *Slate* lamented that Musk's acquisition had fundamentally changed the meaning of Twitter.[388][389] Annika Burgess of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation declared, \"Twitter as the world knew it is dead\".[390] Musk has largely dismissed this negative commentary.[391][392][393]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** D'Onfro, Jillian; Ranj, Brandt (January 20, 2022). \"The very first tweets from famous tech execs like Elon Musk and Marissa Mayer\". *Business Insider*.

Created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from the face book directories often given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities. Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old (or older), except in the case of a handful of nations, where the age limit is 14 years.[6] As of December 2022[update], Facebook claimed 3 billion monthly active users.[7] As of October 2023 Facebook ranked as the 3rd most visited website in the world with 22.56% of its traffic coming from the United States.[8][9] It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[10]\n\n\nFacebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their \"friend\" or, with different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each other with Messenger, join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow.\n\n\nThe subject of numerous controversies, Facebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy (as with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S. elections) and mass surveillance.[11] Facebook has also been subject to criticism over psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and various controversies over content such as fake news, conspiracy theories, copyright infringement, and hate speech.[12] Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content, as well as exaggerating its number of users to appeal to advertisers.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n### 2003–2006: Thefacebook, Thiel investment, and name change[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Original layout and name of *Thefacebook* in 2004, showing Al Pacino's face superimposed with binary numbers as Facebook's original logo, designed by co-founder Andrew McCollum[14]\nZuckerberg built a website called \"Facemash\" in 2003 while attending Harvard University. The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used \"photos compiled from the online face books of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the \"hotter\" person\".[15] Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours.[16] The site was sent to several campus group listservs, but was shut down a few days later by Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged with breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.[15] Zuckerberg expanded on this project that semester by creating a social study tool. He uploaded art images, each accompanied by a comments section, to a website he shared with his classmates.[17]\n\n\nA \"face book\" is a student directory featuring photos and personal information.[16] In 2003, Harvard had only a paper version[18] along with private online directories.[15][19] Zuckerberg told *The Harvard Crimson*, \"Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard. ... I think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week.\"[19] In January 2004, Zuckerberg coded a new website, known as \"TheFacebook\", inspired by a *Crimson* editorial about Facemash, stating, \"It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available ... the benefits are many.\" Zuckerberg met with Harvard student Eduardo Saverin, and each of them agreed to invest $1,000 ($1,613 in 2023 dollars[20]) in the site.[21] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched \"TheFacebook\", originally located at thefacebook.com.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mark Zuckerberg, co-creator of Facebook, in his Harvard dorm room, 2005\nSix days after the site launched, Harvard seniors Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com. They claimed that he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.[23] The three complained to the *Crimson* and the newspaper began an investigation. They later sued Zuckerberg, settling in 2008[24] for 1.2 million shares (worth $300 million at Facebook's IPO, or $398 million in 2023 dollars[20]).[25]\n\n\nMembership was initially restricted to students of Harvard College. Within a month, more than half the undergraduates had registered.[26] Dustin Moskovitz, Andrew McCollum, and Chris Hughes joined Zuckerberg to help manage the growth of the website.[27] In March 2004, Facebook expanded to Columbia, Stanford and Yale.[28] It then became available to all Ivy League colleges, Boston University, NYU, MIT, and successively most universities in the United States and Canada.[29][30]\n\n\nIn mid-2004, Napster co-founder and entrepreneur Sean Parker—an informal advisor to Zuckerberg—became company president.[31] In June 2004, the company moved to Palo Alto, California.[32] Sean Parker called Reid Hoffman to fund Facebook. However, Reid Hoffman was too busy launching LinkedIn so he set Facebook up with PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who gave Facebook its first investment later that month.[33][34] In 2005, the company dropped \"the\" from its name after purchasing the domain name Facebook.com for US$200,000 ($312,012 in 2023 dollars[20]).[35] The domain had belonged to AboutFace Corporation.\n\n\nIn May 2005, Accel Partners invested $12.7 million ($19.8 million in 2023 dollars[20]) in Facebook, and Jim Breyer[36] added $1 million ($1.56 million in 2023 dollars[20]) of his own money. A high-school version of the site launched in September 2005.[37] Eligibility expanded to include employees of several companies, including Apple Inc. and Microsoft.[38]\n\n\n\n### 2006–2012: Public access, Microsoft alliance, and rapid growth[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2006, Facebook hired its first intern, Julie Zhuo.[39] After a month, Zhuo was hired as a full-time engineer.[39] On September 26, 2006, Facebook opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid email address.[40][41][42] By late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 pages on which companies promoted themselves.[43] Organization pages began rolling out in May 2009.[44] On October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240 million ($353 million in 2023 dollars[20]), giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15 billion ($22 billion in 2023 dollars[20]). Microsoft's purchase included rights to place international advertisements.[45][46]\n\n\nIn May 2007, at the first f8 developers conference, Facebook announced the launch of the Facebook Developer Platform, providing a framework for software developers to create applications that interact with core Facebook features. By the second annual f8 developers conference on July 23, 2008, the number of applications on the platform had grown to 33,000, and the number of registered developers had exceeded 400,000.[47]\n\n\nThe website won awards such as placement into the \"Top 100 Classic Websites\" by *PC Magazine* in 2007,[48] and winning the \"People's Voice Award\" from the Webby Awards in 2008.[49] In early 2008, Facebook became EBITDA profitable, but was not cash flow positive yet.[50]\n\n\nOn July 20, 2008, Facebook introduced \"Facebook Beta\", a significant redesign of its user interface on selected networks. The Mini-Feed and Wall were consolidated, profiles were separated into tabbed sections, and an effort was made to create a cleaner look.[51] Facebook began migrating users to the new version in September 2008.[52] In July 2008, Facebook sued StudiVZ, a German social network that was alleged to be visually and functionally similar to Facebook.[53][54]\n\n\nIn October 2008, Facebook announced that its international headquarters would locate in Dublin, Ireland.[55] A January 2009 Compete.com study ranked Facebook the most used social networking service by worldwide monthly active users.[56][*better source needed*] China blocked Facebook in 2009 following the Ürümqi riots.[57]\n\n\nIn 2009, Yuri Milner's DST (which later split into DST Global and Mail.ru Group), alongside Uzbek Russian metals magnate Alisher Usmanov, invested $200 million in Facebook when it was valued at $10 billion.[58][59][60] A separate stake was also acquired by Usmanov's USM Holdings on another occasion.[61][58] According to the New York Times in 2013, \"Mr. Usmanov and other Russian investors at one point owned nearly 10 percent of Facebook, though precise details of their ownership stakes are difficult to assess.\"[61] It was later revealed in 2017 by the Paradise Papers that lending by Russian state-backed VTB Bank and Gazprom's investment vehicle partially financed these 2009 investments, although Milner was reportedly unaware at the time.[62][63]\n\n\nIn May 2009, Zuckerberg said of the $200 million Russian investment, \"This investment is purely buffer for us. It is not something we needed to get to cash flow positive.\"[64] In September 2009, Facebook became cash flow positive ahead of schedule[65][66] after closing a roughly $200 million gap in operating profitability.[66]\n\n\nIn 2010, Facebook won the Crunchie \"Best Overall Startup Or Product\" award[67] for the third year in a row.[68]\n\n\nThe company announced 500 million users in July 2010.[69] Half of the site's membership used Facebook daily, for an average of 34 minutes, while 150 million users accessed the site from mobile devices. A company representative called the milestone a \"quiet revolution\".[70] In October 2010 groups were introduced.[71] In November 2010, based on SecondMarket Inc. (an exchange for privately held companies' shares), Facebook's value was $41 billion ($57.3 billion in 2023 dollars[20]). The company had slightly surpassed eBay to become the third largest American web company after Google and Amazon.com.[72][73]\n\n\nOn November 15, 2010, Facebook announced it had acquired the domain name fb.com from the American Farm Bureau Federation for an undisclosed amount. On January 11, 2011, the Farm Bureau disclosed $8.5 million ($11.5 million in 2023 dollars[20]) in \"domain sales income\", making the acquisition of FB.com one of the ten highest domain sales in history.[74]\n\n\nIn February 2011, Facebook announced plans to move its headquarters to the former Sun Microsystems campus in Menlo Park, California.[75][76] In March 2011, it was reported that Facebook was removing about 20,000 profiles daily for violations such as spam, graphic content and underage use, as part of its efforts to boost cyber security.[77] Statistics showed that Facebook reached one trillion page views in the month of June 2011, making it the most visited website tracked by DoubleClick.[78][79] According to a Nielsen study, Facebook had in 2011 become the second-most accessed website in the U.S. behind Google.[80][81]\n\n\n\n### 2012–2013: IPO, lawsuits, and one billion active users[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Initial public offering of Facebook\n\nIn March 2012, Facebook announced App Center, a store selling applications that operate via the website. The store was to be available on iPhones, Android devices, and for mobile web users.[82]\n\n\n\n![](image)Billboard on the Thomson Reuters building welcomes Facebook to NASDAQ, May 2012.\nFacebook's initial public offering came on May 17, 2012, at a share price of US$38 ($50.00 in 2023 dollars[20]). The company was valued at $104 billion ($138 billion in 2023 dollars[20]), the largest valuation to that date.[83][84][85] The IPO raised $16 billion ($21.2 billion in 2023 dollars[20]), the third-largest in U.S. history, after Visa Inc. in 2008 and AT&T Wireless in 2000.[86][87] Based on its 2012 income of $5 billion ($6.64 billion in 2023 dollars[20]), Facebook joined the Fortune 500 list for the first time in May 2013, ranked 462.[88] The shares set a first-day record for trading volume of an IPO (460 million shares).[89] The IPO was controversial given the immediate price declines that followed,[90][91][92][93] and was the subject of lawsuits,[94] while SEC and FINRA both launched investigations.[95]\n\n\nZuckerberg announced at the start of October 2012 that Facebook had one billion monthly active users,[96] including 600 million mobile users, 219 billion photo uploads and 140 billion friend connections.[97]\n\n\nOn October 1, 2012, Zuckerberg visited Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in Russia and to boost Facebook's position in the Russian market.[98][99]\n\n\n\n### 2013–2014: Site developments, A4AI, and 10th anniversary[edit]\n\n\nOn January 15, 2013, Facebook announced Facebook Graph Search, which provides users with a \"precise answer\", rather than a link to an answer by leveraging data present on its site.[100] Facebook emphasized that the feature would be \"privacy-aware\", returning results only from content already shared with the user.[101] On April 3, 2013, Facebook unveiled Facebook Home, a user-interface layer for Android devices offering greater integration with the site. HTC announced HTC First, a phone with Home pre-loaded.[102]\n\n\nOn April 15, 2013, Facebook announced an alliance across 19 states with the National Association of Attorneys General, to provide teenagers and parents with information on tools to manage social networking profiles.[103] On April 19 Facebook modified its logo to remove the faint blue line at the bottom of the \"F\" icon. The letter F moved closer to the edge of the box.[104]\n\n\nFollowing a campaign by 100 advocacy groups, Facebook agreed to update its policy on hate speech. The campaign highlighted content promoting domestic violence and sexual violence against women and led 15 advertisers to withdraw, including Nissan UK, House of Burlesque, and Nationwide UK. The company initially stated, \"while it may be vulgar and offensive, distasteful content on its own does not violate our policies\".[105] It took action on May 29.[106]\n\n\nOn June 12, Facebook announced that it was introducing clickable hashtags to help users follow trending discussions, or search what others are talking about on a topic.[107] San Mateo County, California, became the top wage-earning county in the country after the fourth quarter of 2012 because of Facebook. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the average salary was 107% higher than the previous year, at $168,000 a year ($222,961 in 2023 dollars[20]), more than 50% higher than the next-highest county, New York County (better known as Manhattan), at roughly $110,000 a year ($145,986 in 2023 dollars[20]).[108]\n\n\nFacebook joined Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) in October, as it launched. The A4AI is a coalition of public and private organizations that includes Google, Intel and Microsoft. Led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable to ease access in the developing world.[109]\n\n\nThe company celebrated its 10th anniversary during the week of February 3, 2014.[110] In January 2014, over one billion users connected via a mobile device.[111] As of June, mobile accounted for 62% of advertising revenue, an increase of 21% from the previous year.[112] By September Facebook's market capitalization had exceeded $200 billion ($257 billion in 2023 dollars[20]).[113][114][115]\n\n\nZuckerberg participated in a Q&A session at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, on October 23, where he attempted to converse in Mandarin. Zuckerberg hosted visiting Chinese politician Lu Wei, known as the \"Internet czar\" for his influence in China's online policy, on December 8.[116][117][118]\n\n\n\n### 2015–2020: Algorithm revision; fake news[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2015[update], Facebook's algorithm was revised in an attempt to filter out false or misleading content, such as fake news stories and hoaxes. It relied on users who flag a story accordingly. Facebook maintained that satirical content should not be intercepted.[119] The algorithm was accused of maintaining a \"filter bubble\", where material the user disagrees with[120] and posts with few likes would be deprioritized.[121] In November, Facebook extended paternity leave from 4 weeks to 4 months.[122]\n\n\nOn April 12, 2016, Zuckerberg outlined his 10-year vision, which rested on three main pillars: artificial intelligence, increased global connectivity, and virtual and augmented reality.[123] In July, a US$1 billion suit was filed against the company alleging that it permitted Hamas to use it to perform assaults that cost the lives of four people.[124] Facebook released its blueprints of Surround 360 camera on GitHub under an open-source license.[125] In September, it won an Emmy for its animated short \"Henry\".[126] In October, Facebook announced a fee-based communications tool called Workplace that aims to \"connect everyone\" at work. Users can create profiles, see updates from co-workers on their news feed, stream live videos and participate in secure group chats.[127]\n\n\nFollowing the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Facebook announced that it would combat fake news by using fact checkers from sites like FactCheck.org and Associated Press (AP), making reporting hoaxes easier through crowdsourcing, and disrupting financial incentives for abusers.[128]\n\n\n\n![](image)Oculus VR headset[129]\nOn January 17, 2017, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg planned to open Station F, a startup incubator campus in Paris, France.[130] On a six-month cycle, Facebook committed to work with ten to 15 data-driven startups there.[131] On April 18, Facebook announced the beta launch of Facebook Spaces at its annual F8 developer conference.[132] Facebook Spaces is a virtual reality version of Facebook for Oculus VR goggles. In a virtual and shared space, users can access a curated selection of 360-degree photos and videos using their avatar, with the support of the controller. Users can access their own photos and videos, along with media shared on their newsfeed.[133] In September, Facebook announced it would spend up to US$1 billion on original shows for its Facebook Watch platform.[134] On October 16, it acquired the anonymous compliment app tbh, announcing its intention to leave the app independent.[135][136][137][138]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Facebook expanded its work with Definers Public Affairs, a PR firm that had originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company to address concerns primarily regarding Russian meddling, then mishandling of user data by Cambridge Analytica, hate speech on Facebook, and calls for regulation.[139] Company spokesman Tim Miller stated that a goal for tech firms should be to \"have positive content pushed out about your company and negative content that's being pushed out about your competitor\". Definers claimed that George Soros was the force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement, and created other negative media, along with America Rising, that was picked up by larger media organisations like *Breitbart News*.[139][140] Facebook cut ties with the agency in late 2018, following public outcry over their association.[141] Posts originating from the Facebook page of *Breitbart News*, a media organization previously affiliated with Cambridge Analytica,[142] are currently[*when?*] among the most widely shared political content on Facebook.[143][144][145][146][147][*excessive citations*]\n\n\nIn May 2018 at F8, the company announced it would offer its own dating service. Shares in competitor Match Group fell by 22%.[148] Facebook Dating includes privacy features and friends are unable to view their friends' dating profile.[149] In July, Facebook was charged £500,000 by UK watchdogs for failing to respond to data erasure requests.[150] On July 18, Facebook established a subsidiary named Lianshu Science & Technology in Hangzhou City, China, with $30 million ($36.4 million in 2023 dollars[20]) of capital. All its shares are held by Facebook Hong.[151] Approval of the registration of the subsidiary was then withdrawn, due to a disagreement between officials in Zhejiang province and the Cyberspace Administration of China.[152] On July 26, Facebook became the first company to lose over $100 billion ($121 billion in 2023 dollars[20]) worth of market capitalization in one day, dropping from nearly $630 billion to $510 billion after disappointing sales reports.[153][154] On July 31, Facebook said that the company had deleted 17 accounts related to the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. On September 19, Facebook announced that, for news distribution outside the United States, it would work with U.S. funded democracy promotion organizations, International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute, which are loosely affiliated with the Republican and Democratic parties.[155] Through the Digital Forensic Research Lab Facebook partners with the Atlantic Council, a NATO-affiliated think tank.[155] In November, Facebook launched smart displays branded Portal and Portal Plus (Portal+). They support Amazon's Alexa (intelligent personal assistant service). The devices include video chat function with Facebook Messenger.[156][157]\n\n\nIn August 2018, a lawsuit was filed in Oakland, California claiming that Facebook created fake accounts in order to inflate its user data and appeal to advertisers in the process.[13]\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Meta HQ in Menlo Park, California\nIn January 2019, the 10-year challenge was started[158] asking users to post a photograph of themselves from 10 years ago (2009) and a more recent photo.[159]\n\n\nCriticized for its role in vaccine hesitancy, Facebook announced in March 2019 that it would provide users with \"authoritative information\" on the topic of vaccines.[160]\nA study published in the journal *Vaccine* of advertisements posted in the three months prior to that found that 54% of the anti-vaccine advertisements on Facebook were placed by just two organisations funded by well-known anti-vaccination activists.[161][162] The Children's Health Defense / World Mercury Project chaired by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Stop Mandatory Vaccination, run by campaigner Larry Cook, posted 54% of the advertisements. The ads often linked to commercial products, such as natural remedies and books.\n\n\nOn March 14, the *Huffington Post* reported that Facebook's PR agency had paid someone to tweak Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's Wikipedia page, as well as adding a page for the global head of PR, Caryn Marooney.[163]\n\n\nIn March 2019, the perpetrator of the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand used Facebook to stream live footage of the attack as it unfolded. Facebook took 29 minutes to detect the livestreamed video, which was eight minutes longer than it took police to arrest the gunman. About 1.3m copies of the video were blocked from Facebook but 300,000 copies were published and shared. Facebook has promised changes to its platform; spokesman Simon Dilner told Radio New Zealand that it could have done a better job. Several companies, including the ANZ and ASB banks, have stopped advertising on Facebook after the company was widely condemned by the public.[164] Following the attack, Facebook began blocking white nationalist, white supremacist, and white separatist content, saying that they could not be meaningfully separated. Previously, Facebook had only blocked overtly supremacist content. The older policy had been condemned by civil rights groups, who described these movements as functionally indistinct.[165][166] Further bans were made in mid-April 2019, banning several British far-right organizations and associated individuals from Facebook, and also banning praise or support for them.[167][168]\n\n\nNTJ's member Moulavi Zahran Hashim, a radical Islamist imam believed to be the mastermind behind the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings, preached on a pro-ISIL Facebook account, known as \"Al-Ghuraba\" media.[169][170]\n\n\n\n![](image)Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook executives with President Donald Trump in September 2019\nOn May 2, 2019, at F8, the company announced its new vision with the tagline \"the future is private\".[171] A redesign of the website and mobile app was introduced, dubbed as \"FB5\".[172] The event also featured plans for improving groups,[173] a dating platform,[174] end-to-end encryption on its platforms,[175] and allowing users on Messenger to communicate directly with WhatsApp and Instagram users.[176][177]\n\n\nOn July 31, 2019, Facebook announced a partnership with University of California, San Francisco to build a non-invasive, wearable device that lets people type by simply imagining themselves talking.[178]\n\n\nOn August 13, 2019, it was revealed that Facebook had enlisted hundreds of contractors to create and obtain transcripts of the audio messages of users.[179][180][181] This was especially common of Facebook Messenger, where the contractors frequently listened to and transcribed voice messages of users.[181] After this was first reported on by Bloomberg News, Facebook released a statement confirming the report to be true,[180] but also stated that the monitoring program was now suspended.[180]\n\n\nOn September 5, 2019, Facebook launched Facebook Dating in the United States. This new application allows users to integrate their Instagram posts in their dating profile.[182]\n\n\nFacebook News, which features selected stories from news organizations, was launched on October 25.[183] Facebook's decision to include far-right website *Breitbart News* as a \"trusted source\" was negatively received.[184][185]\n\n\nOn November 17, 2019, the banking data for 29,000 Facebook employees was stolen from a payroll worker's car. The data was stored on unencrypted hard drives and included bank account numbers, employee names, the last four digits of their social security numbers, salaries, bonuses, and equity details. The company did not realize the hard drives were missing until November 20. Facebook confirmed that the drives contained employee information on November 29. Employees were not notified of the break-in until December 13, 2019.[186]\n\n\nOn March 10, 2020, Facebook appointed two new directors Tracey Travis and Nancy Killefer to their board of members.[187]\n\n\nIn June 2020, several major companies including Adidas, Aviva, Coca-Cola, Ford, HP, InterContinental Hotels Group, Mars, Starbucks, Target, and Unilever, announced they would pause adverts on Facebook for July in support of the Stop Hate For Profit campaign which claimed the company was not doing enough to remove hateful content.[188] The BBC noted that this was unlikely to affect the company as most of Facebook's advertising revenue comes from small- to medium-sized businesses.[189]\n\n\nOn August 14, 2020, Facebook started integrating the direct messaging service of Instagram with its own Messenger for both iOS and Android devices. After the update, an update screen is said to pop up on Instagram's mobile app with the following message, \"There's a New Way to Message on Instagram\" with a list of additional features. As part of the update, the regular DM icon on the top right corner of Instagram will be replaced by the Facebook Messenger logo.[190]\n\n\nOn September 15, 2020, Facebook launched a climate science information centre to promote authoritative voices on climate change and provide access of \"factual and up-to-date\" information on climate science. It featured facts, figures and data from organizations, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Met Office, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and World Meteorological Organization (WMO), with relevant news posts.[191]\n\n\nAfter the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Facebook temporarily increased the weight of ecosystem quality in its news feed algorithm.[192]\n\n\n\n### 2020–present: FTC lawsuit, corporate re-branding, shut down of facial recognition technology, ease of policy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2021 Facebook leak and Frances Haugen\n\nFacebook was sued by the Federal Trade Commission as well as a coalition of several states for illegal monopolization and antitrust. The FTC and states sought the courts to force Facebook to sell its subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram.[193][194] The suits were dismissed by a federal judge on June 28, 2021, who stated that there was not enough evidence brought in the suit to determine Facebook to be a monopoly at this point, though allowed the FTC to amend its case to include additional evidence.[195] In its amended filings in August 2021, the FTC asserted that Facebook had been a monopoly in the area of personal social networks since 2011, distinguishing Facebook's activities from social media services like TikTok that broadcast content without necessarily limiting that message to intended recipients.[196]\n\n\nIn response to the proposed bill in the Australian Parliament for a News Media Bargaining Code, on February 17, 2021, Facebook blocked Australian users from sharing or viewing news content on its platform, as well as pages of some government, community, union, charity, political, and emergency services.[197] The Australian government strongly criticised the move, saying it demonstrated the \"immense market power of these digital social giants\".[198]\n\n\nOn February 22, Facebook said it reached an agreement with the Australian government that would see news returning to Australian users in the coming days. As part of this agreement, Facebook and Google can avoid the News Media Bargaining Code adopted on February 25 if they \"reach a commercial bargain with a news business outside the Code\".[199][200][201]\n\n\nFacebook has been accused of removing and shadow banning content that spoke either in favor of protesting Indian farmers or against Narendra Modi's government.[202][203][204] India-based employees of Facebook are at risk of arrest.[205]\n\n\nOn February 27, 2021, Facebook announced Facebook BARS app for rappers.[206]\n\n\nOn June 29, 2021, Facebook announced Bulletin, a platform for independent writers.[207][208] Unlike competitors such as Substack, Facebook would not take a cut of subscription fees of writers using that platform upon its launch, like Malcolm Gladwell and Mitch Albom. According to *The Washington Post* technology writer Will Oremus, the move was criticized by those who viewed it as an tactic intended by Facebook to force those competitors out of business.[209]\n\n\nIn October 2021, owner Facebook, Inc. changed its company name to Meta Platforms, Inc., or simply \"Meta\", as it shifts its focus to building the \"metaverse\". This change does not affect the name of the Facebook social networking service itself, instead being similar to the creation of Alphabet as Google's parent company in 2015.[210]\n\n\nIn November 2021, Facebook stated it would stop targeting ads based on data related to health, race, ethnicity, political beliefs, religion and sexual orientation. The change will occur in January and will affect all apps owned by Meta Platforms.[211]\n\n\nIn February 2022, Facebook's daily active users dropped for the first time in its 18-year history. According to Facebook's parent Meta, DAUs dropped to 1.929 billion in the three months ending in December, down from 1.930 billion the previous quarter. Furthermore, the company warned that revenue growth would slow due to competition from TikTok and YouTube, as well as advertisers cutting back on spending.[212]\n\n\nOn March 10, 2022, Facebook announced that it will temporarily ease rules to allow violent speech against 'Russian invaders'.[213] Russia then banned all Meta services, including Instagram.[214]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Jonathan Vanian, a Technology Reporter for CNBC, wrote a piece on CNBC.com about the recent struggles Facebook was experiencing, writing \n\"Users are jumping ship and advertisers are reducing their spending, leaving Meta poised to report its second straight drop in quarterly revenue.\" He also cited poor leadership decisions devoting resources to the metaverse, writing \"CEO Mark Zuckerberg spends much of his time proselytizing the metaverse, which may be the company's future but accounts for virtually none of its near-term revenue and is costing billions of dollars a year to build.\" \nHe also detailed accounts from analysts predicting a \"death spiral\" for Facebook stock as users leave, ad impressions increase, and the company chases revenue.[215]\n\n\n\n#### October 4, 2021, global service outage[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 Facebook outage\n\nOn October 4, 2021, Facebook had its worst outage since 2008. The outage was global in scope, and took down all Facebook properties, including Instagram and WhatsApp, from approximately 15:39 UTC to 22:05 UTC, and affected roughly three billion users.[216][217][218] Security experts identified the problem as a BGP withdrawal of all of the IP routes to their Domain Name (DNS) servers which were all self-hosted at the time.[219][220] The outage also affected all internal communications systems used by Facebook employees, which disrupted restoration efforts.[220]\n\n\n\n#### Shutdown of facial recognition[edit]\n\n\nOn November 2, 2021, Facebook announced it would shut down its facial recognition technology and delete the data on over a billion users.[221] Meta later announced plans to implement the technology as well as other biometric systems in its future products, such as the metaverse.[222]\n\n\nThe shutdown of the technology will reportedly also stop Facebook's automated alt text system, used to transcribe media on the platform for visually impaired users.[222]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta would start selling blue \"verified\" badges on Instagram and Facebook.[223]\n\n\n\n## Website[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Facebook features and Facebook Platform\n\n![](image)Profile shown on Thefacebook in 2005\n![](image)Previous Facebook logo in use from August 23, 2005, until July 1, 2015\n### Technical aspects[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section's **factual accuracy may be compromised due to out-of-date information**. The reason given is: Facebook no longer uses HipHop for PHP. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(August 2020)*\n |\n\n\nThe website's primary color is blue as Zuckerberg is red–green colorblind, a realization that occurred after a test undertaken around 2007.[224][225] Facebook is built in PHP, compiled with HipHop for PHP, a \"source code transformer\" built by Facebook engineers that turns PHP into C++.[226] The deployment of HipHop reportedly reduced average CPU consumption on Facebook servers by 50%.[227]\n\n\n\n#### 2012 architecture[edit]\n\n\nFacebook is developed as one monolithic application. According to an interview in 2012 with Facebook build engineer Chuck Rossi, Facebook compiles into a 1.5 GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom BitTorrent-based release system. Rossi stated that it takes about 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process has zero downtime. Changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.[227]\n\n\nFacebook used a combination platform based on HBase to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them to storage. The user interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as AJAX behavior. These requests are written to a log file using Scribe (developed by Facebook).[228]\n\n\nData is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out. Ptail data are separated into three streams and sent to clusters in different data centers (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods. (A hot article generates many impressions and news feed impressions that cause huge data skews.) Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a hash table.[228]\n\n\nData is then output in PHP format. The backend is written in Java. Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions display pages more quickly. The data is then sent to MapReduce servers where it is queried via Hive. This serves as a backup as the data can be recovered from Hive.[228]\n\n\n\n#### Content delivery network (CDN)[edit]\n\n\nFacebook uses its own content delivery network or \"edge network\" under the domain fbcdn.net for serving static data.[229][230] Until the mid-2010s, Facebook also relied on Akamai for CDN services.[231][232][233]\n\n\n\n#### Hack programming language[edit]\n\n\nOn March 20, 2014, Facebook announced a new open-source programming language called Hack. Before public release, a large portion of Facebook was already running and \"battle tested\" using the new language.[234]\n\n\n\n### User profile/personal timeline[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Facebook login/signup screen\nEach registered user on Facebook has a personal profile that shows their posts and content.[235] The format of individual user pages was revamped in September 2011 and became known as \"Timeline\", a chronological feed of a user's stories,[236][237] including status updates, photos, interactions with apps and events.[238] The layout let users add a \"cover photo\".[238] Users were given more privacy settings.[238] In 2007, Facebook launched Facebook Pages for brands and celebrities to interact with their fanbases.[239][240] 100,000 Pages[*further explanation needed*] launched in November.[241] In June 2009, Facebook introduced a \"Usernames\" feature, allowing users to choose a unique nickname used in the URL for their personal profile, for easier sharing.[242][243]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Facebook expanded the gender setting, adding a custom input field that allows users to choose from a wide range of gender identities. Users can also set which set of gender-specific pronoun should be used in reference to them throughout the site.[244][245][246] In May 2014, Facebook introduced a feature to allow users to ask for information not disclosed by other users on their profiles. If a user does not provide key information, such as location, hometown, or relationship status, other users can use a new \"ask\" button to send a message asking about that item to the user in a single click.[247][248]\n\n\n\n### News Feed[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: News Feed\n\nNews Feed appears on every user's homepage and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events and friends' birthdays.[249] This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause.[250] Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users).[251] Zuckerberg apologized for the site's failure to include appropriate privacy features. Users then gained control over what types of information are shared automatically with friends. Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts and newly added friends.[252]\n\n\nOn February 23, 2010, Facebook was granted a patent[253] on certain aspects of its News Feed. The patent covers News Feeds in which links are provided so that one user can participate in the activity of another user.[254] The sorting and display of stories in a user's News Feed is governed by the EdgeRank algorithm.[255]\n\n\nThe Photos application allows users to upload albums and photos.[256] Each album can contain 200 photos.[257] Privacy settings apply to individual albums. Users can \"tag\", or label, friends in a photo. The friend receives a notification about the tag with a link to the photo.[258] This photo tagging feature was developed by Aaron Sittig, now a Design Strategy Lead at Facebook, and former Facebook engineer Scott Marlette back in 2006 and was only granted a patent in 2011.[259][260]\n\n\nOn June 7, 2012, Facebook launched its App Center to help users find games and other applications.[261]\n\n\nOn May 13, 2015, Facebook in association with major news portals launched \"Instant Articles\" to provide news on the Facebook news feed without leaving the site.[262][263]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Facebook launched Facebook Stories for iOS and Android in Ireland. The feature, following the format of Snapchat and Instagram stories, allows users to upload photos and videos that appear above friends' and followers' News Feeds and disappear after 24 hours.[264]\n\n\nOn October 11, 2017, Facebook introduced the 3D Posts feature to allow for uploading interactive 3D assets.[265] On January 11, 2018, Facebook announced that it would change News Feed to prioritize friends/family content and de-emphasize content from media companies.[266]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Facebook announced it would spend $1 billion ($1.18 billion in 2023 dollars[20]) to license news material from publishers for the next three years; a pledge coming as the company falls under scrutiny from governments across the globe over not paying for news content appearing on the platform. The pledge would be in addition to the $600 million ($706 million in 2023 dollars[20]) paid since 2018 through deals with news companies such as *The Guardian* and *Financial Times*.[267][268][269]\n\n\nIn March and April 2021, in response to Apple announcing changes to its iOS device's Identifier for Advertisers policy, which included requiring app developers to directly request to users the ability to track on an opt-in basis, Facebook purchased full-page newspaper advertisements attempting to convince users to allow tracking, highlighting the effects targeted ads have on small businesses.[270] Facebook's efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, as Apple released iOS 14.5 in late April 2021, containing the feature for users in what has been deemed \"App Tracking Transparency\". Moreover, statistics from Verizon Communications subsidiary Flurry Analytics show 96% of all iOS users in the United States are not permitting tracking at all, and only 12% of worldwide iOS users are allowing tracking, which some news outlets deem \"Facebook's nightmare\", among similar terms.[271][272][273][274] Despite the news, Facebook has stated that the new policy and software update would be \"manageable\".[275]\n\n\n\n### Like button[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Facebook like button\n\n![](image)Human billboard advertising Facebook Canberra in the City page at the National Multicultural FestivalThe \"like\" button, stylized as a \"thumbs up\" icon, was first enabled on February 9, 2009,[276] and enables users to easily interact with status updates, comments, photos and videos, links shared by friends, and advertisements. Once clicked by a user, the designated content is more likely to appear in friends' News Feeds.[277][278] The button displays the number of other users who have liked the content.[279] The like button was extended to comments in June 2010.[280] In February 2016, Facebook expanded Like into \"Reactions\", choosing among five pre-defined emotions, including \"Love\", \"Haha\", \"Wow\", \"Sad\", or \"Angry\".[281][282][283][284] In late April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a new \"Care\" reaction was added.[285]\n\n\n### Instant messaging[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Facebook Messenger\n\nFacebook Messenger is an instant messaging service and software application. It began as Facebook Chat in 2008,[286] was revamped in 2010[287] and eventually became a standalone mobile app in August 2011, while remaining part of the user page on browsers.[288]\n\n\nComplementing regular conversations, Messenger lets users make one-to-one[289] and group[290] voice[291] and video calls.[292] Its Android app has integrated support for SMS[293] and \"Chat Heads\", which are round profile photo icons appearing on-screen regardless of what app is open,[294] while both apps support multiple accounts,[295] conversations with optional end-to-end encryption[296] and \"Instant Games\".[297] Some features, including sending money[298] and requesting transportation,[299] are limited to the United States.[298] In 2017, Facebook added \"Messenger Day\", a feature that lets users share photos and videos in a story-format with all their friends with the content disappearing after 24 hours;[300] Reactions, which lets users tap and hold a message to add a reaction through an emoji;[301] and Mentions, which lets users in group conversations type @ to give a particular user a notification.[301]\n\n\nBusinesses and users can interact through Messenger with features such as tracking purchases and receiving notifications, and interacting with customer service representatives. Third-party developers can integrate apps into Messenger, letting users enter an app while inside Messenger and optionally share details from the app into a chat.[302] Developers can build chatbots into Messenger, for uses such as news publishers building bots to distribute news.[303] The M virtual assistant (U.S.) scans chats for keywords and suggests relevant actions, such as its payments system for users mentioning money.[304][305] Group chatbots appear in Messenger as \"Chat Extensions\". A \"Discovery\" tab allows finding bots, and enabling special, branded QR codes that, when scanned, take the user to a specific bot.[306]\n\n\n\n### Privacy policy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: § Privacy\n\nFacebook's data policy outlines its policies for collecting, storing, and sharing user's data.[307] Facebook enables users to control access to individual posts and their profile[308] through privacy settings.[309] The user's name and profile picture (if applicable) are public.\n\n\nFacebook's revenue depends on targeted advertising, which involves analyzing user data to decide which ads to show each user. Facebook buys data from third parties, gathered from both online and offline sources, to supplement its own data on users. Facebook maintains that it does not share data used for targeted advertising with the advertisers themselves.[310] The company states:\n\n\n\n\n> \"We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.\"[307]\n> \n> \n\n\nAs of October 2021[update], Facebook claims it uses the following policy for sharing user data with third parties:\n\n\n\n\n> Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.\n> \n> \n> When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.\n> \n> \n> Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.\n> \n> \n> \n> Note: We are in the process of restricting developers' data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.[307]\n> \n> \n\n\nFacebook will also share data with law enforcement if needed to.[307]\n\n\nFacebook's policies have changed repeatedly since the service's debut, amid a series of controversies covering everything from how well it secures user data, to what extent it allows users to control access, to the kinds of access given to third parties, including businesses, political campaigns and governments. These facilities vary according to country, as some nations require the company to make data available (and limit access to services), while the European Union's GDPR regulation mandates additional privacy protections.[311]\n\n\n\n### Bug Bounty Program[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Facebook \"White Hat\" debit card, given to researchers who report security bugs\nOn July 29, 2011, Facebook announced its Bug Bounty Program that paid security researchers a minimum of $500 ($677.00 in 2023 dollars[20]) for reporting security holes. The company promised not to pursue \"white hat\" hackers who identified such problems.[312][313] This led researchers in many countries to participate, particularly in India and Russia.[314]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Userbase[edit]\n\n\nFacebook's rapid growth began as soon as it became available and continued through 2018, before beginning to decline.\n\n\nFacebook passed 100 million registered users in 2008,[315] and 500 million in July 2010.[69] According to the company's data at the July 2010 announcement, half of the site's membership used Facebook daily, for an average of 34 minutes, while 150 million users accessed the site by mobile.[70]\n\n\nIn October 2012, Facebook's monthly active users passed one billion,[96][316] with 600 million mobile users, 219 billion photo uploads, and 140 billion friend connections.[97] The 2 billion user mark was crossed in June 2017.[317][318]\n\n\nIn November 2015, after skepticism about the accuracy of its \"monthly active users\" measurement, Facebook changed its definition to a logged-in member who visits the Facebook site through the web browser or mobile app, or uses the Facebook Messenger app, in the 30-day period prior to the measurement. This excluded the use of third-party services with Facebook integration, which was previously counted.[319]\n\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, the percentage of the U.S. population over the age of 12 who use Facebook has declined, from 67% to 61% (a decline of some 15 million U.S. users), with a higher drop-off among younger Americans (a decrease in the percentage of U.S. 12- to 34-year-olds who are users from 58% in 2015 to 29% in 2019).[320][321] The decline coincided with an increase in the popularity of Instagram, which is also owned by Meta.[320][321]\n\n\nThe number of daily active users experienced a quarterly decline for the first time in the last quarter of 2021, down to 1.929 billion from 1.930 billion,[322] but increased again the next quarter despite being banned in Russia.[323]\n\n\nHistorically, commentators have offered predictions of Facebook's decline or end, based on causes such as a declining user base;[324] the legal difficulties of being a closed platform, inability to generate revenue, inability to offer user privacy, inability to adapt to mobile platforms, or Facebook ending itself to present a next generation replacement;[325] or Facebook's role in Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.[326]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

The rest of the world has 750 million users.[328]\n\n\nOver the 2008–2018 period, the percentage of users under 34 declined to less than half of the total.[311]\n\n\n\n### Censorship[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Censorship of Facebook and Censorship by Facebook\n\n![](image)Map showing the countries that are either currently blocking or have blocked Facebook in the past Currently blocked\nFormerly blocked\n\nIn many countries the social networking sites and mobile apps have been blocked temporarily or permanently, including China,[329] Iran,[330] Vietnam,[331] Pakistan,[332] Syria,[333] and North Korea. In May 2018, the government of Papua New Guinea announced that it would ban Facebook for a month while it considered the impact of the website on the country, though no ban has since occurred.[334] In 2019, Facebook announced it would start enforcing its ban on users, including influencers, promoting any vape, tobacco products, or weapons on its platforms.[335]\n\n\n\n## Criticisms and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Criticism of Facebook\n\n> \n> \"I'm here today because I believe Facebook's products harm children, stoke division, and weaken our democracy. The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Frances Haugen, condemning lack of transparency around Facebook at a US congressional hearing (2021).[336]\n\n> \n> \"I don't believe private companies should make all of the decisions on their own. That's why we have advocated for updated internet regulations for several years now. I have testified in Congress multiple times and asked them to update these regulations. I've written op-eds outlining the areas of regulation we think are most important related to elections, harmful content, privacy, and competition.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Mark Zuckerberg, responding to Frances Haugen's revelations (2021).[337]\n\nFacebook's importance and scale has led to criticisms in many domains. Issues include Internet privacy, excessive retention of user information,[338] its facial recognition software, DeepFace[339][340] its addictive quality[341] and its role in the workplace, including employer access to employee accounts.[342]\n\n\nFacebook has been criticized for electricity usage,[343] tax avoidance,[344] real-name user requirement policies,[345] censorship[346][347] and its involvement in the United States PRISM surveillance program.[348]\nAccording to *The Express Tribune*, Facebook \"avoided billions of dollars in tax using offshore companies\".[349]\n\n\nFacebook is alleged to have harmful psychological effects on its users, including feelings of jealousy[350][351] and stress,[352][353] a lack of attention[354] and social media addiction.[355][356] According to Kaufmann et al., mothers' motivations for using social media are often related to their social and mental health.[357] European antitrust regulator Margrethe Vestager stated that Facebook's terms of service relating to private data were \"unbalanced\".[358]\n\n\nFacebook has been criticized for allowing users to publish illegal or offensive material. Specifics include copyright and intellectual property infringement,[359] hate speech,[360][361] incitement of rape[362] and terrorism,[363][364] fake news,[365][366][367] and crimes, murders, and livestreaming violent incidents.[368][369][370] Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content.[371][372][373][374][375][376][*excessive citations*]\nSri Lanka blocked both Facebook and WhatsApp in May 2019 after anti-Muslim riots, the worst in the country since the Easter Sunday bombing in the same year as a temporary measure to maintain peace in Sri Lanka.[377][378]\nFacebook removed 3 billion fake accounts only during the last quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019;[379] in comparison, the social network reports 2.39 billion monthly active users.[379]\n\n\nIn late July 2019, the company announced it was under antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.[380]\n\n\nThe consumer advocacy group, Which?, claims that individuals are still utilizing Facebook to set up fraudulent five-star ratings for various products. The group has identified 14 communities that exchange reviews for either money or complimentary items such as watches, earbuds, and sprinklers.[381]\n\n\n\n### Privacy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Privacy concerns with Facebook\n\nSee also: Privacy concerns with social networking services § Facebook\n\nFacebook has faced a steady stream of controversies over how it handles user privacy, repeatedly adjusting its privacy settings and policies.[382]\n\n\nSince 2009, Facebook has been participating in the PRISM secret program, sharing with the US National Security Agency audio, video, photographs, e-mails, documents and connection logs from user profiles, among other social media services.[383][384]\n\n\nOn November 29, 2011, Facebook settled Federal Trade Commission charges that it deceived consumers by failing to keep privacy promises.[385] In August 2013 High-Tech Bridge published a study showing that links included in Facebook messaging service messages were being accessed by Facebook.[386] In January 2014 two users filed a lawsuit against Facebook alleging that their privacy had been violated by this practice.[387]\n\n\nOn June 7, 2018, Facebook announced that a bug had resulted in about 14 million Facebook users having their default sharing setting for all new posts set to \"public\".[388]\n\n\nOn April 4, 2019, half a billion records of Facebook users were found exposed on Amazon cloud servers, containing information about users' friends, likes, groups, and checked-in locations, as well as names, passwords and email addresses.[389]\n\n\nThe phone numbers of at least 200 million Facebook users were found to be exposed on an open online database in September 2019. They included 133 million US users, 18 million from the UK, and 50 million from users in Vietnam. After removing duplicates, the 419 million records have been reduced to 219 million. The database went offline after TechCrunch contacted the web host. It is thought the records were amassed using a tool that Facebook disabled in April 2018 after the Cambridge Analytica controversy. A Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement: \"The dataset is old and appears to have information obtained before we made changes last year...There is no evidence that Facebook accounts were compromised.\"[390]\n\n\nFacebook's privacy problems resulted in companies like Viber Media and Mozilla discontinuing advertising on Facebook's platforms.[391][392]\n\n\n\n#### Racial bias[edit]\n\n\nFacebook was accused of committing \"systemic\" racial bias by EEOC based on the complaints of three rejected candidates and a current employee of the company. The three rejected employees along with the Operational Manager at Facebook as of March 2021 accused the firm of discriminating against Black people. The EEOC has initiated an investigation into the case.[393]\n\n\n\n#### Shadow profiles[edit]\n\n\nA \"shadow profile\" refers to the data Facebook collects about individuals without their explicit permission. For example, the \"like\" button that appears on third-party websites allows the company to collect information about an individual's internet browsing habits, even if the individual is not a Facebook user.[394][395] Data can also be collected by other users. For example, a Facebook user can link their email account to their Facebook to find friends on the site, allowing the company to collect the email addresses of users and non-users alike.[396] Over time, countless data points about an individual are collected; any single data point perhaps cannot identify an individual, but together allows the company to form a unique \"profile\".\n\n\nThis practice has been criticized by those who believe people should be able to opt-out of involuntary data collection. Additionally, while Facebook users have the ability to download and inspect the data they provide to the site, data from the user's \"shadow profile\" is not included, and non-users of Facebook do not have access to this tool regardless. The company has also been unclear whether or not it is possible for a person to revoke Facebook's access to their \"shadow profile\".[394]\n\n\n\n#### Cambridge Analytica[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal\n\nFacebook customer Global Science Research sold information on over 87 million Facebook users to Cambridge Analytica, a political data analysis firm led by Alexander Nix.[397] While approximately 270,000 people used the app, Facebook's API permitted data collection from their friends without their knowledge.[398] At first Facebook downplayed the significance of the breach, and suggested that Cambridge Analytica no longer had access. Facebook then issued a statement expressing alarm and suspended Cambridge Analytica. Review of documents and interviews with former Facebook employees suggested that Cambridge Analytica still possessed the data.[399] This was a violation of Facebook's consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. This violation potentially carried a penalty of $40,000 ($48,534 in 2023 dollars[20]) per occurrence, totalling trillions of dollars.[400]\n\n\nAccording to *The Guardian*, both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica threatened to sue the newspaper if it published the story. After publication, Facebook claimed that it had been \"lied to\". On March 23, 2018, The English High Court granted an application by the Information Commissioner's Office for a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's London offices, ending a standoff between Facebook and the Information Commissioner over responsibility.[401]\n\n\nOn March 25, Facebook published a statement by Zuckerberg in major UK and US newspapers apologizing over a \"breach of trust\".[402]\n\n\n\n\n> You may have heard about a quiz app built by a university researcher that leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014. This was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time. We're now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again.\n> \n> \n> We've already stopped apps like this from getting so much information. Now we're limiting the data apps get when you sign in using Facebook.\n> \n> \n> We're also investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this. We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.\n> \n> \n> Finally, we'll remind you which apps you've given access to your information – so you can shut off the ones you don't want anymore.\n> \n> \n> \n> Thank you for believing in this community. I promise to do better for you.\n> \n> \n\n\nOn March 26, the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into the matter.[403] The controversy led Facebook to end its partnerships with data brokers who aid advertisers in targeting users.[382]\n\n\nOn April 24, 2019, Facebook said it could face a fine between $3 billion ($3.58 billion in 2023 dollars[20]) to $5 billion ($5.96 billion in 2023 dollars[20]) as the result of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.[404] On July 24, 2019, the FTC fined Facebook $5 billion, the largest penalty ever imposed on a company for violating consumer privacy. Additionally, Facebook had to implement a new privacy structure, follow a 20-year settlement order, and allow the FTC to monitor Facebook.[405] Cambridge Analytica's CEO and a developer faced restrictions on future business dealings and were ordered to destroy any personal information they collected. Cambridge Analytica filed for bankruptcy.[406]\n\n\nFacebook also implemented additional privacy controls and settings[407] in part to comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect in May.[408] Facebook also ended its active opposition to the California Consumer Privacy Act.[409]\n\n\nSome, such as Meghan McCain have drawn an equivalence between the use of data by Cambridge Analytica and the Barack Obama's 2012 campaign, which, according to *Investor's Business Daily*, \"encouraged supporters to download an Obama 2012 Facebook app that, when activated, let the campaign collect Facebook data both on users and their friends.\"[410][411][412] Carol Davidsen, the Obama for America (OFA) former director of integration and media analytics, wrote that \"Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn't stop us once they realised that was what we were doing\".[411][412] PolitiFact has rated McCain's statements \"Half-True\", on the basis that \"in Obama's case, direct users knew they were handing over their data to a political campaign\" whereas with Cambridge Analytica, users thought they were only taking a personality quiz for academic purposes, and while the Obama campaign only used the data \"to have their supporters contact their most persuadable friends\", Cambridge Analytica \"targeted users, friends and lookalikes directly with digital ads.\"[413]\n\n\n\n#### Breaches[edit]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2018, Facebook experienced a major breach in its security, exposing the data of 50 million users. The data breach started in July 2017 and was discovered on September 16.[414] Facebook notified users affected by the exploit and logged them out of their accounts.[415][416]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Facebook confirmed a password compromise of millions of Facebook lite application users also affected millions of Instagram users. The reason cited was the storage of password as plain text instead of encryption which could be read by its employees.[417]\n\n\nOn December 19, 2019, security researcher Bob Diachenko discovered a database containing more than 267 million Facebook user IDs, phone numbers, and names that were left exposed on the web for anyone to access without a password or any other authentication.[418]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Facebook encountered a major security breach in which its official Twitter account was hacked by a Saudi Arabia-based group called \"OurMine\". The group has a history of actively exposing high-profile social media profiles' vulnerabilities.[419]\n\n\nIn April 2021, *The Guardian* reported approximately half a billion users' data had been stolen including birthdates and phone numbers. Facebook alleged it was \"old data\" from a problem fixed in August 2019 despite the data's having been released a year and a half later only in 2021; it declined to speak with journalists, had apparently not notified regulators, called the problem \"unfixable\", and said it would not be advising users.[420]\n\n\n\n#### Phone data and activity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Facebook acquired Onavo's virtual private network to harvest usage data on its competitors.\nAfter acquiring Onavo in 2013, Facebook used its Onavo Protect virtual private network (VPN) app to collect information on users' web traffic and app usage. This allowed Facebook to monitor its competitors' performance, and motivated Facebook to acquire WhatsApp in 2014.[421][422][423] Media outlets classified Onavo Protect as spyware.[424][425][426] In August 2018, Facebook removed the app in response to pressure from Apple, who asserted that it violated their guidelines.[427][428] The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission sued Facebook on December 16, 2020, for \"false, misleading or deceptive conduct\" in response to the company's use of personal data obtained from Onavo for business purposes in contrast to Onavo's privacy-oriented marketing.[429][430]\n\n\nIn 2016, Facebook Research launched Project Atlas, offering some users between the ages of 13 and 35 up to $20 per month ($25.00 in 2023 dollars[20]) in exchange for their personal data, including their app usage, web browsing history, web search history, location history, personal messages, photos, videos, emails and Amazon order history.[431][432] In January 2019, *TechCrunch* reported on the project. This led Apple to temporarily revoke Facebook's Enterprise Developer Program certificates for one day, preventing Facebook Research from operating on iOS devices and disabling Facebook's internal iOS apps.[432][433][434]\n\n\n*Ars Technica* reported in April 2018 that the Facebook Android app had been harvesting user data, including phone calls and text messages, since 2015.[435][436][437] In May 2018, several Android users filed a class action lawsuit against Facebook for invading their privacy.[438][439]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Facebook launched the Off-Facebook Activity page, which allows users to see information collected by Facebook about their non-Facebook activities.[440] *The Washington Post* columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler found that this included what other apps he used on his phone, even while the Facebook app was closed, what other web sites he visited on his phone, and what in-store purchases he made from affiliated businesses, even while his phone was completely off.[441]\n\n\nIn November 2021, a report was published by Fairplay, Global Action Plan and Reset Australia detailing accusations that Facebook was continuing to manage their ad targeting system with data collected from teen users.[442] The accusations follow announcements by Facebook in July 2021 that they would cease ad targeting children.[443][444]\n\n\n\n#### Public apologies[edit]\n\n\nThe company first apologized for its privacy abuses in 2009.[445]\n\n\nFacebook apologies have appeared in newspapers, television, blog posts and on Facebook.[446] On March 25, 2018, leading US and UK newspapers published full-page ads with a personal apology from Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg issued a verbal apology on CNN.[447] In May 2010, he apologized for discrepancies in privacy settings.[446]\n\n\nPreviously, Facebook had its privacy settings spread out over 20 pages, and has now put all of its privacy settings on one page, which makes it more difficult for third-party apps to access the user's personal information.[382] In addition to publicly apologizing, Facebook has said that it will be reviewing and auditing thousands of apps that display \"suspicious activities\" in an effort to ensure that this breach of privacy does not happen again.[448] In a 2010 report regarding privacy, a research project stated that not a lot of information is available regarding the consequences of what people disclose online so often what is available are just reports made available through popular media.[449] In 2017, a former Facebook executive went on the record to discuss how social media platforms have contributed to the unraveling of the \"fabric of society\".[450]\n\n\n\n### Content disputes and moderation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Facebook content management controversies\n\nSee also: Oversight Board\n\nFacebook relies on its users to generate the content that bonds its users to the service. The company has come under criticism both for allowing objectionable content, including conspiracy theories and fringe discourse,[451] and for prohibiting other content that it deems inappropriate.\n\n\n\n#### Misinformation and fake news[edit]\n\n\nFacebook has been criticized as a vector for fake news, and has been accused of bearing responsibility for the conspiracy theory that the United States created ISIS,[452] false anti-Rohingya posts being used by Myanmar's military to fuel genocide and ethnic cleansing,[453][454] enabling climate change denial[455][456][457] and Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theorists,[458] and anti-refugee attacks in Germany.[459][460][461] The government of the Philippines has also used Facebook as a tool to attack its critics.[462]\n\n\nIn 2017, Facebook partnered with fact checkers from the Poynter Institute's International Fact-Checking Network to identify and mark false content, though most ads from political candidates are exempt from this program.[463][464] As of 2018, Facebook had over 40 fact-checking partners across the world, including *The Weekly Standard*.[465] Critics of the program have accused Facebook of not doing enough to remove false information from its website.[465][466]\n\n\nFacebook has repeatedly amended its content policies. In July 2018, it stated that it would \"downrank\" articles that its fact-checkers determined to be false, and remove misinformation that incited violence.[467] Facebook stated that content that receives \"false\" ratings from its fact-checkers can be demonetized and suffer dramatically reduced distribution. Specific posts and videos that violate community standards can be removed on Facebook.[468]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Facebook banned a number of \"dangerous\" commentators from its platform, including Alex Jones, Louis Farrakhan, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Paul Nehlen, David Duke, and Laura Loomer, for allegedly engaging in \"violence and hate\".[469][470]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Facebook agreed to a preliminary settlement of $52 million ($61.2 million in 2023 dollars[20]) to compensate U.S.-based Facebook content moderators for their psychological trauma suffered on the job.[471][472] Other legal actions around the world, including in Ireland, await settlement.[473]\n\n\nIn September 2020, the Government of Thailand utilized the Computer Crime Act for the first time to take action against Facebook and Twitter for ignoring requests to take down content and not complying with court orders.[474]\n\n\n\n#### Threats and incitement[edit]\n\n\nProfessor Ilya Somin reported that he had been the subject of death threats on Facebook in April 2018 from Cesar Sayoc, who threatened to kill Somin and his family and \"feed the bodies to Florida alligators\". Somin's Facebook friends reported the comments to Facebook, which did nothing except dispatch automated messages.[475] Sayoc was later arrested for the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts directed at Democratic politicians.\n\n\n\n#### Terrorism[edit]\n\n\nForce v. Facebook, Inc**.**, 934 F.3d 53 (2nd Cir. 2019) was a case that alleged Facebook was profiting off recommendations for Hamas. In 2019, the US Second Circuit Appeals Court held that Section 230 bars civil terrorism claims against social media companies and internet service providers, the first federal appellate court to do so.\n\n\n\n#### Hate speech[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan urged Mark Zuckerberg, through a letter posted on government's Twitter account, to ban Islamophobic content on Facebook, warning that it encouraged extremism and violence.[476]\n\n\nIn October 2020, the company announced that it would ban Holocaust denial.[477]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Media Matters for America published a report that Facebook and Instagram were still profiting off advertisements using the slur \"groomer\" for LGBT people.[478] The article reported that Meta had previously confirmed that the use of this word for the LGBT community violates its hate speech policies.[478] The story was subsequently picked up by other news outlets such as the *New York Daily News*, *PinkNews*, and *LGBTQ Nation*.[479][480][481]\n\n\n\n#### Violent Erotica[edit]\n\n\nThere are ads on Facebook and Instagram containing sexually explicit content, descriptions of graphic violence and content promoting acts of self harm. Many of the ads are for webnovel apps backed by tech giants Bytedance and Tencent.[482]\n\n\n\n#### *InfoWars*[edit]\n\n\nFacebook was criticized for allowing *InfoWars* to publish falsehoods and conspiracy theories.[468][483][484][485][486] Facebook defended its actions in regards to *InfoWars*, saying \"we just don't think banning Pages for sharing conspiracy theories or false news is the right way to go.\"[484] Facebook provided only six cases in which it fact-checked content on the *InfoWars* page over the period September 2017 to July 2018.[468] In 2018, *InfoWars* falsely claimed that the survivors of the Parkland shooting were \"actors\". Facebook pledged to remove *InfoWars* content making the claim, although *InfoWars* videos pushing the false claims were left up, even though Facebook had been contacted about the videos.[468] Facebook stated that the videos never explicitly called them actors.[468] Facebook also allowed *InfoWars* videos that shared the Pizzagate conspiracy theory to survive, despite specific assertions that it would purge Pizzagate content.[468] In late July 2018, Facebook suspended the personal profile of *InfoWars* head Alex Jones for 30 days.[487] In early August 2018, Facebook banned the four most active *InfoWars*-related pages for hate speech.[488]\n\n\n\n### Political manipulation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: State-sponsored Internet propaganda\n\n![](image)Graffiti in Berlin of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. The caption is a reference to George Orwell's novel *Nineteen Eighty-Four*.\nAs a dominant social-web service with massive outreach, Facebook have been used by identified or unidentified political operatives to affect public opinion. Some of these activities have been done in violation of the platform policies, creating \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\", support or attacks. These activities can be scripted or paid. Various such abusive campaign have been revealed in recent years, best known being the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. In 2021, former Facebook analyst within the *Spam* and *Fake Engagement* teams, Sophie Zhang, reported more than 25 political subversion operations and criticized the general slow reaction time, oversightless, laissez-faire attitude by Facebook.[489][490][491]\n\n\n\n#### Influence Operations and Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Facebook stated that during 2018 they had identified \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" in \"many Pages, Groups and accounts created to stir up political debate, including in the US, the Middle East, Russia and the UK.\"[492]\n\n\nCampaigns operated by the British intelligence agency unit, called Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group, have broadly fallen into two categories; cyber attacks and propaganda efforts. The propaganda efforts utilize \"mass messaging\" and the \"pushing [of] stories\" via social media sites like Facebook.[493][494] Israel's Jewish Internet Defense Force, the Chinese Communist Party's 50 Cent Party and Turkey's AK Trolls also focus their attention on social media platforms like Facebook.[495][496][497][498]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Samantha Bradshaw, co-author of the report from the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) at Oxford University, said that \"The number of countries where formally organised social media manipulation occurs has greatly increased, from 28 to 48 countries globally. The majority of growth comes from political parties who spread disinformation and junk news around election periods.\"[499]\n\n\nIn October 2018, *The Daily Telegraph* reported that Facebook \"banned hundreds of pages and accounts that it says were fraudulently flooding its site with partisan political content – although they came from the United States instead of being associated with Russia.\"[500]\n\n\nIn December 2018, *The Washington Post* reported that \"Facebook has suspended the account of Jonathon Morgan, the chief executive of a top social media research firm\" New Knowledge, \"after reports that he and others engaged in an operation to spread disinformation\" on Facebook and Twitter during the 2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama.[501][502]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Facebook said it has removed 783 Iran-linked accounts, pages and groups for engaging in what it called \"coordinated inauthentic behaviour\".[503] In March 2019, Facebook sued four Chinese firms for selling \"fake accounts, likes and followers\" to amplify Chinese state media outlets.[504]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Tel Aviv-based private intelligence agency Archimedes Group was banned from Facebook for \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" after Facebook found fake users in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia.[505] Facebook investigations revealed that Archimedes had spent some $1.1 million ($1.31 million in 2023 dollars[20]) on fake ads, paid for in Brazilian reais, Israeli shekels and US dollars.[506] Facebook gave examples of Archimedes Group political interference in Nigeria, Senegal, Togo, Angola, Niger and Tunisia.[507] The Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab said in a report that \"The tactics employed by Archimedes Group, a private company, closely resemble the types of information warfare tactics often used by governments, and the Kremlin in particular.\"[508][509]\n\n\nOn May 23, 2019, Facebook released its Community Standards Enforcement Report highlighting that it has identified several fake accounts through artificial intelligence and human monitoring. In a period of six months, October 2018-March 2019, the social media website removed a total of 3.39 billion fake accounts. The number of fake accounts was reported to be more than 2.4 billion real people on the platform.[510]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Facebook advanced its measures to counter deceptive political propaganda and other abuse of its services. The company removed more than 1,800 accounts and pages that were being operated from Russia, Thailand, Ukraine and Honduras.[511] After Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it was announced that the internet regulatory committee would block access to Facebook.[512]\n\n\nOn October 30, 2019, Facebook deleted several accounts of the employees working at the Israeli NSO Group, stating that the accounts were \"deleted for not following our terms\". The deletions came after WhatsApp sued the Israeli surveillance firm for targeting 1,400 devices with spyware.[513]\n\n\n\nIn 2020, Facebook helped found American Edge, an anti-regulation lobbying firm to fight anti-trust probes.[514] The group runs ads that \"fail to mention what legislation concerns them, how those concerns could be fixed, or how the horrors they warn of could actually happen\", and do not clearly disclose that they are funded by Facebook.[515]\n\n\nIn 2020, the government of Thailand forced Facebook to take down a Facebook group called Royalist Marketplace with 1 million members following potentially illegal posts shared. The authorities have also threatened Facebook with legal action. In response, Facebook is planning to take legal action against the Thai government for suppression of freedom of expression and violation of human rights.[516]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Facebook removed the main page of the Myanmar military, after two protesters were shot and killed during the anti-coup protests. Facebook said that the page breached its guidelines that prohibit the incitement of violence.[517] On February 25, Facebook announced to ban all accounts of the Myanmar military, along with the \"Tatmadaw-linked commercial entities\". Citing the \"exceptionally severe human rights abuses and the clear risk of future military-initiated violence in Myanmar\", the tech giant also implemented the move on its subsidiary, Instagram.[518]\n\n\nIn March 2021, *The Wall Street Journal*'s editorial board criticized Facebook's decision to fact-check its op-ed titled \"We'll Have Herd immunity by April\" written by surgeon Marty Makary, calling it \"counter-opinion masquerading as fact checking.\"[519]\n\n\nFacebook guidelines allow users to call for the death of public figures, they also allow praise of mass killers and 'violent non-state actors' in some situations.[520][521]\n\n\nIn 2021, former Facebook analyst within the *Spam* and *Fake Engagement* teams, Sophie Zhang, reported on more than 25 political subversion operations she uncovered while in Facebook, and the general laissez-faire by the private enterprise.[489][490][491]\n\n\nIn 2021, Facebook was cited as playing a role in the fomenting of the 2021 United States Capitol attack.[522][523]\n\n\n\n#### Russian interference[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Internet Research Agency and Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections\n\nIn 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian organizations for \"engaging in operations to interfere with U.S. political and electoral processes, including the 2016 presidential election.\"[524][525][526]\n\n\nMueller contacted Facebook subsequently to the company's disclosure that it had sold more than $100,000 ($126,955 in 2023 dollars[20]) worth of ads to a company (Internet Research Agency, owned by Russian billionaire and businessman Yevgeniy Prigozhin) with links to the Russian intelligence community before the 2016 United States presidential election.[527][528] In September 2017, Facebook's chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote the company \"found approximately $100,000 in ad spending from June 2015 to May 2017 – associated with roughly 3,000 ads – that was connected to about 470 inauthentic accounts and Pages in violation of our policies. Our analysis suggests these accounts and Pages were affiliated with one another and likely operated out of Russia.\"[529] Clinton and Trump campaigns spent $81 million ($103 million in 2023 dollars[20]) on Facebook ads.[530]\n\n\nThe company pledged full cooperation in Mueller's investigation, and provided all information about the Russian advertisements.[531] Members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have claimed that Facebook had withheld information that could illuminate the Russian propaganda campaign.[532] Russian operatives have used Facebook polarize the American public discourses, organizing both Black Lives Matter rallies[533][534] and anti-immigrant rallies on U.S. soil,[535] as well as anti-Clinton rallies[536] and rallies both for and against Donald Trump.[537][538] Facebook ads have also been used to exploit divisions over black political activism and Muslims by simultaneously sending contrary messages to different users based on their political and demographic characteristics in order to sow discord.[539][540][541] Zuckerberg has stated that he regrets having dismissed concerns over Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[542]\n\n\nRussian-American billionaire Yuri Milner, who befriended Zuckerberg[543] between 2009 and 2011, had Kremlin backing for his investments in Facebook and Twitter.[63]\n\n\n\nIn January 2019, Facebook removed 289 pages and 75 coordinated accounts linked to the Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik which had misrepresented themselves as independent news or general interest pages.[544][545] Facebook later identified and removed an additional 1,907 accounts linked to Russia found to be engaging in \"coordinated inauthentic behaviour\".[546] In 2018, a UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee report had criticised Facebook for its reluctance to investigate abuse of its platform by the Russian government, and for downplaying the extent of the problem, referring to the company as 'digital gangsters'.[547][548][549]\n\n\n> \"Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day,\" Damian Collins, DCMS Committee Chair[549]\n> \n> \n\nIn February 2019, Glenn Greenwald wrote that a cybersecurity company New Knowledge, which is behind one of the Senate reports on Russian social media election interference, \"was caught just six weeks ago engaging in a massive scam to create fictitious Russian troll accounts on Facebook and Twitter in order to claim that the Kremlin was working to defeat Democratic Senate nominee Doug Jones in Alabama. *The New York Times*, when exposing the scam, quoted a New Knowledge report that boasted of its fabrications...\"[550][551]\n\n\n#### Anti-Rohingya propaganda[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Persecution of Muslims in Myanmar\n\nIn 2018, Facebook took down 536 Facebook pages, 17 Facebook groups, 175 Facebook accounts, and 16 Instagram accounts linked to the Myanmar military. Collectively these were followed by over 10 million people.[552] *The New York Times* reported that:[553]\n\n\n\n\n> after months of reports about anti-Rohingya propaganda on Facebook, the company acknowledged that it had been too slow to act in Myanmar. By then, more than 700,000 Rohingya had fled the country in a year, in what United Nations officials called \"a textbook example of ethnic cleansing\".\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Anti-Muslim propaganda and Hindu nationalism in India[edit]\n\n\nA 2019 book titled *The Real Face of Facebook in India*, co-authored by the journalists Paranjoy Guha Thakurta and Cyril Sam, alleged that Facebook helped enable and benefited from the rise of Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India.[554]\n\n\nAnkhi Das, Facebook's policy director for India and South and Central Asia, apologized publicly in August 2020 for sharing a Facebook post that called Muslims in India a \"degenerate community\". She said she shared the post \"to reflect my deep belief in celebrating feminism and civic participation\".[555] She is reported to have prevented action by Facebook against anti-Muslim content[556][557] and supported the BJP in internal Facebook messages.[558][559]\n\n\nIn 2020, Facebook executives overrode their employees' recommendations that the BJP politician T. Raja Singh should be banned from the site for hate speech and rhetoric that could lead to violence. Singh had said on Facebook that Rohingya Muslim immigrants should be shot and had threatened to destroy mosques. Current and former Facebook employees told *The Wall Street Journal* that the decision was part of a pattern of favoritism by Facebook toward the BJP as it seeks more business in India.[557] Facebook also took no action after BJP politicians made posts accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading COVID-19, an employee said.[560]\n\n\nOn August 31, 2020, the Delhi Assembly began investigating whether Facebook bore blame for the 2020 religious riots in the city, claiming it had found Facebook \"prima facie guilty of a role in the violence\".[561][562] On September 12, 2020, a Delhi Assembly committee said in a statement that it had asked Facebook India head Ajit Mohan to appear before it on September 15, leading to Facebook objecting and moving the Supreme Court of India against the decision.[563][564] On September 15, Facebook skipped the Delhi Assembly panel hearing.[565] On September 20, the Delhi Assembly panel issued a new notice asking Facebook to appear before it on September 23.[566] On September 22, Facebook India vice-president and managing director Ajit Mohan moved the Supreme Court against the summons of the Delhi Assembly Committee.[567] On September 23, the Supreme Court granted him relief and ordered a stay to the summons, with the Central government later backing the decision.[568][569][570] A former Facebook employee told a Delhi Assembly panel on November 13 that the violence could have been 'easily averted' if the social media giant had acted in a 'proactive and prompt manner'.[571] On December 3, the Delhi Assembly moved the Supreme Court for intervention in the case.[572] On February 4, 2021, the Delhi Assembly panel issued a fresh notice to Facebook India to testify on the riots, avoiding specific notice to Mohan, by asking a senior, responsible officer from the company to appear before the panel.[573] The Union government submitted in the Supreme Court that Facebook could not be made accountable before any state assembly and the committee formed was unconstitutional.[574][575] On February 24, Mohan challenged summons issued by the Delhi assembly for failing to appear before it as a witness in connection with the 2020 riots in the Supreme Court, saying that the 'right to silence' is a virtue in present 'noisy times' and the legislature had no authority to examine him in a law and order case. The Supreme Court reserved its judgment for the case.[576] On July 8, the Supreme Court refused to quash the summons and asked Facebook asked to appear before the Delhi assembly panel.[577]\n\n\nOn 23 September 2023, it was reported that Facebook had delayed for about a year when in 2021, it removed a network of accounts ran by India's Chinar Corps which spread disinformation that would put Kashmiri journalists in danger. The delay and the previously not publicized takedown action were due a fear that its local employees would be targeted by authorities, and that it would hurt business prospects in the country.[578]\n\n\n\n### Company governance[edit]\n\n\nEarly Facebook investor and former Zuckerberg mentor Roger McNamee described Facebook as having \"the most centralized decision-making structure I have ever encountered in a large company.\"[579] Nathan Schneider, a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder argued for transforming Facebook into a platform cooperative owned and governed by the users.[580]\n\n\nFacebook co-founder Chris Hughes states that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has too much power, that the company is now a monopoly, and that, as a result, it should be split into multiple smaller companies. Hughes called for the breakup of Facebook in an op-ed on *The New York Times*. Hughes says he's concerned that Zuckerberg has surrounded himself with a team that does not challenge him and that as a result, it's the U.S. government's job to hold him accountable and curb his \"unchecked power\".[581] Hughes also said that \"Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American.\"[582] Several U.S. politicians agree with Hughes.[583] EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager has stated that splitting Facebook should only be done as \"a remedy of the very last resort\", and that splitting Facebook would not solve Facebook's underlying problems.[584]\n\n\n\n### Litigation[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Lawsuits involving Meta Platforms\n\nThe company has been subject to repeated litigation.[585][586][587][588] Its most prominent case addressed allegations that Zuckerberg broke an oral contract with Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra to build the then-named \"HarvardConnection\" social network in 2004.[589][590][591]\n\n\nOn March 6, 2018, BlackBerry sued Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp subdivision for ripping off key features of its messaging app.[592]\n\n\nIn October 2018, a Texan woman sued Facebook, claiming she had been recruited into the sex trade at the age of 15 by a man who \"friended\" her on the social media network. Facebook responded that it works both internally and externally to ban sex traffickers.[593][594]\n\n\nIn 2019, British solicitors representing a bullied Syrian schoolboy, sued Facebook over false claims. They claimed that Facebook protected prominent figures from scrutiny instead of removing content that violates its rules and that the special treatment was financially driven.[595][596]\n\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of New York state and 47 other state and regional governments filed separate suits against Facebook on December 9, 2020, seeking antitrust action based on its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsUp among other companies, calling these practices as anticompetitive. The suits also assert that in acquiring these products, they weakened their privacy measures for their users. The suits, besides other fines, seek to unwind the acquisitions from Facebook.[597][598]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2022, France's data privacy regulatory body CNIL fined Facebook a 60 million euros for not allowing its internet users an easy refusal of cookies along with Google.[599]\n\n\nOn December 22, 2022, the Quebec Court of Appeal approved a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Facebook users who claim they were discriminated against because the platform allows advertisers to target both job and housing advertisements based on various factors, including age, gender, and even race.[600] The lawsuit centres on the platform's practice of \"micro targeting ads\", claiming ads are ensured to appear only in the feeds of people who belong to certain targeted groups. Women, for example, would not see ads targeting men, while older generation men would not see an ad aimed at people between 18 and 45.[600]\n\n\nThe class action could include thousands of Quebec residents who have been using the platform as early as April 2016, who were seeking jobs or housing during that period.[600] Facebook has 60 days after the court's December 22 ruling to decide to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of Canada. If it does not appeal, the case returns to the Quebec Superior Court.[600]\n\n\n\n### Minors exposed to sexual content on VR apps[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2022, a BBC News researcher posing as a 13-year-old girl witnessed grooming, sexual material, racist insults and a rape threat on the VRChat app. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children head of online child safety policy Andy Burrows added the investigation had found \"a toxic combination of risks\". The BBC researcher downloaded VRChat from an app store on Facebook's Meta Quest headset, with no age verification checks – the only requirement being a Facebook account. The BBC News researcher created a fake profile to set up her account – and her real identity was not checked.[601][602] While Oculus has a form where users can report abuse, the Center for Countering Digital Hate claims Meta rarely takes them seriously; although reporting 100 policy violations on Oculus, they did not receive a response. Imran Ahmed, the charity's chief executive, branded it \"a cesspit of hate, pornography and child grooming.\"[603][604]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Facebook on the ad:tech 2010\n### Scope[edit]\n\n\nA commentator in *The Washington Post* noted that Facebook constitutes a \"massive depository of information that documents both our reactions to events and our evolving customs with a scope and immediacy of which earlier historians could only dream\".[605] Especially for anthropologists, social researchers, and social historians—and subject to proper preservation and curation—the website \"will preserve images of our lives that are vastly crisper and more nuanced than any ancestry record in existence\".[605]\n\n\n\n### Economy[edit]\n\n\nEconomists have noted that Facebook offers many non-rivalrous services that benefit as many users as are interested without forcing users to compete with each other. By contrast, most goods are available to a limited number of users. E.g., if one user buys a phone, no other user can buy that phone. Three areas add the most economic impact: platform competition, the market place and user behavior data.[606]\n\n\nFacebook began to reduce its carbon impact after Greenpeace attacked it for its long-term reliance on coal and resulting carbon footprint.[607] In 2021 Facebook announced that their global operations are supported by 100 percent renewable energy and they have reached net zero emissions, a goal set in 2018.[608][609]\n\n\nFacebook provides a development platform for many social gaming, communication, feedback, review, and other applications related to online activities. This platform spawned many businesses and added thousands of jobs to the global economy. Zynga Inc., a leader in social gaming, is an example of such a business. An econometric analysis found that Facebook's app development platform added more than 182,000 jobs in the U.S. economy in 2011. The total economic value of the added employment was about $12 billion ($16.3 billion in 2023 dollars[20]).[610]\n\n\n\n### Society[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Social networking service § Social impact, Social impact of the Internet § Social networking and entertainment, and Social capital\n\nFacebook was one of the first large-scale social networks. In *The Facebook Effect*, David Kirkpatrick stated that Facebook's structure makes it difficult to replace, because of its \"network effects\".[*neutrality is disputed*] As of 2016, it is estimated that 44 percent of the US population gets news through Facebook.[611] A study published at Frontiers Media in 2023 found that there was more polarization of the user-base on Facebook than even far-right social networks like Gab.[612]\n\n\n\n### Mental and emotional health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Social media and suicide\n\nStudies have associated social networks with positive[613] and negative impacts[614][615][616][617][618] on emotional health.\n\n\nStudies have associated Facebook with feelings of envy, often triggered by vacation and holiday photos. Other triggers include posts by friends about family happiness and images of physical beauty—such feelings leave people dissatisfied with their own lives. A joint study by two German universities discovered that one out of three people were more dissatisfied with their lives after visiting Facebook,[619][620] and another study by Utah Valley University found that college students felt worse about themselves following an increase in time on Facebook.[620][621][622] Professor Larry D. Rosen stated that teenagers on Facebook exhibit more narcissistic tendencies, while young adults show signs of antisocial behavior, mania and aggressiveness.\n\n\nPositive effects include signs of \"virtual empathy\" with online friends and helping introverted persons learn social skills.[623] A 2020 experimental study in the *American Economic Review* found that deactivating Facebook led to increased subjective well-being.[624] In a blog post in December 2017, the company highlighted research that has shown \"passively consuming\" the News Feed, as in reading but not interacting, left users with negative feelings, whereas interacting with messages pointed to improvements in well-being.[625]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see Social media in politics.\n\nFurther information: Social media and political communication in the United States and Social media in the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign\n\nSee also: WhatsApp § Hoaxes and fake news\n\nIn February 2008, a Facebook group called \"One Million Voices Against FARC\" organized an event in which hundreds of thousands of Colombians marched in protest against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).[626] In August 2010, one of North Korea's official government websites and the country's official news agency, Uriminzokkiri, joined Facebook.[627]\n\n\n\n![](image)A man during the 2011 Egyptian protests carrying a card saying \"Facebook,#jan25, The Egyptian Social Network\"\nDuring the Arab Spring many journalists claimed that Facebook played a major role in the 2011 Egyptian revolution.[628][629] On January 14, the Facebook page of \"We are all Khaled Said\" was started by Wael Ghoniem to invite the Egyptian people to \"peaceful demonstrations\" on January 25. According to Mashable,[*unreliable source?*] in Tunisia and Egypt, Facebook became the primary tool for connecting protesters and led the Egyptian government to ban Facebook, Twitter and other websites on January 26[630] then ban all mobile and Internet connections for all of Egypt on January 28. After 18 days, the uprising forced President Hosni Mubarak to resign.\n\n\nIn a Bahraini uprising that started on February 14, 2011, Facebook was utilized by the Bahraini regime and regime loyalists to identify, capture and prosecute citizens involved in the protests. A 20-year-old woman named Ayat Al Qurmezi was identified as a protester using Facebook and imprisoned.[631]\n\n\nIn 2011, Facebook filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to form a political action committee under the name *FB PAC*.[632] In an email to *The Hill*, a spokesman for Facebook said \"Facebook Political Action Committee will give our employees a way to make their voice heard in the political process by supporting candidates who share our goals of promoting the value of innovation to our economy while giving people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.\"[633]\n\n\nDuring the Syrian civil war, the YPG, a libertarian army for Rojava recruited westerners through Facebook in its fight against ISIL.[634] Dozens joined its ranks. The Facebook page's name \"The Lions of Rojava\" comes from a Kurdish saying which translates as \"A lion is a lion, whether it's a female or a male\", reflecting the organization's feminist ideology.[635]\n\n\nIn recent years, Facebook's News Feed algorithms have been identified as a cause of political polarization, for which it has been criticized.[636][637] It has likewise been accused of amplifying the reach of 'fake news' and extreme viewpoints, as when it may have enabled conditions which led to the 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis.[638][639]\n\n\nFacebook first played a role in the American political process in January 2008, shortly before the New Hampshire primary. Facebook teamed up with ABC and Saint Anselm College to allow users to give live feedback about the \"back to back\" January 5 Republican and Democratic debates.[640][641][642] Facebook users took part in debate groups on specific topics, voter registration and message questions.[643]\n\n\nOver a million people installed the Facebook application \"US Politics on Facebook\" in order to take part which measured responses to specific comments made by the debating candidates.[644] A poll by CBS News, UWIRE and *The Chronicle of Higher Education* claimed to illustrate how the \"Facebook effect\" had affected youthful voters, increasing voting rates, support of political candidates, and general involvement.[645]\n\n\nThe new social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, connected hundreds of millions of people. By 2008, politicians and interest groups were experimenting with systematic use of social media to spread their message.[646][647] By the 2016 election, political advertising to specific groups had become normalized. Facebook offered the most sophisticated targeting and analytics platform.[648] ProPublica noted that their system enabled advertisers to direct their pitches to almost 2,300 people who expressed interest in the topics of \"Jew hater\", \"How to burn Jews\", or, \"History of 'why Jews ruin the world\".[649]\n\n\nFacebook has used several initiatives to encourage its users to register to vote and vote. An experiment in 2012 involved showing Facebook users pictures of their friends who reported that they had voted; users who were shown the pictures were about 2% more likely to report that they had also voted compared to the control group, which was not encouraged to vote.[650] In 2020, Facebook announced the goal of helping four million voters register in the US, saying that it had registered 2.5 million by September.[651]\n\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica data scandal offered another example of the perceived attempt to influence elections.[652][653] *The Guardian* claimed that Facebook knew about the security breach for two years, but did nothing to stop it until it became public.[654]\n\n\nFacebook banned political ads to prevent the manipulation of voters in the US's November's election. Industry experts suggested[*clarification needed*] that there are several other ways for misinformation to reach voters on social media platforms and blocking political ads will not serve as a proven solution to the problem.[655]\n\n\n\n#### India[edit]\n\n\nAhead of the 2019 general elections in India, Facebook has removed 103 pages, groups and accounts on Facebook and Instagram platforms originating from Pakistan. Facebook said its investigation found a Pakistani military link, along with a mix of real accounts of ISPR employees, and a network of fake accounts created by them that have been operating military fan pages, general interest pages but were posting content about Indian politics while trying to conceal their identity.[656] Owing to the same reasons, Facebook also removed 687 pages and accounts of Congress because of coordinated inauthentic behavior on the platform.[657]\n\n\n\n### Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Facebook parade float in San Francisco Pride 2014\nFacebook and Zuckerberg have been the subject of music, books, film and television. The 2010 film *The Social Network*, directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin, stars Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg and went on to win three Academy Awards and four Golden Globes.\n\n\nIn 2008, Collins English Dictionary declared \"Facebook\" as its new Word of the Year.[658] In December 2009, the New Oxford American Dictionary declared its word of the year to be the verb \"unfriend\", defined as \"To remove someone as a 'friend' on a social networking site such as Facebook\".[659]\n\n\n\n### Internet.org[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Internet.org\n\nIn August 2013, Facebook founded Internet.org in collaboration with six other technology companies to plan and help build affordable Internet access for underdeveloped and developing countries.[660] The service, called Free Basics, includes various low-bandwidth applications such as AccuWeather, BabyCenter, BBC News, ESPN, and Bing.[661][662] There was severe opposition to Internet.org in India, where the service started in partnership with Reliance Communications in 2015 was banned a year later by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). In 2018, Zuckerberg claimed that \"Internet.org efforts have helped almost 100 million people get access to the internet who may not have had it otherwise.\"[661]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nFacebook announced in 2021 that it will make an effort to stop disinformation about climate change. The company will use George Mason University, Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the University of Cambridge as sources of information. The company will expand its information hub on climate to 16 countries. Users in other countries will be directed to the site of the United Nations Environment Programme for information.[663]\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Ambient awareness\n* Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland\n* Cyberstalking\n* DARPA LifeLog\n* Double Irish tax scheme\n* Facebook malware\n* Six degrees of separation\n* Social graph\n* Timeline of social media\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Facebook Interface Languages\". *Facebook (Select your language)*.

Accessible worldwide,[7] it was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is owned by Google and is the second most visited website in the world, after Google Search. YouTube has more than 2.5 billion monthly users,[8] who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos every day.[9] As of May 2019[update], videos were being uploaded to the platform at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.[10][11]\n\n\nIn October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion.[12] Google's ownership of YouTube expanded the site's business model, expanding from generating revenue from advertisements alone to offering paid content such as movies and exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an increase in revenue of $9 billion from the previous year.[1] YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022.[13]\n\n\nSince its purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips, news, short films, feature films, songs, documentaries, movie trailers, teasers, live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and corporate sponsors. Established media corporations such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. Discovery have also created and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to advertise to a greater audience.\n\n\nYouTube has had unprecedented social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating multimillionaire celebrities. Despite its growth and success, it has been widely criticized for allegedly facilitating the spread of misinformation and the sharing of copyrighted content, routinely violating its users' privacy, enabling censorship, endangering child safety and wellbeing, and for its inconsistent or incorrect implementation of platform guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of YouTube\n\n### Founding and initial growth (2005–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, the founders of YouTube.\nYouTube was founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. The trio were early employees of PayPal, which left them enriched after the company was bought by eBay.[14] Hurley had studied design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.[15]\n\n\nAccording to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party \"was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible\".[16]\n\n\nKarim said the inspiration for YouTube came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, when Janet Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by Justin Timberlake during the halftime show. Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami online, which led to the idea of a video-sharing site.[17] Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not.[16][18] They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100 reward.[19] Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any video.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)The YouTube logo used from its launch until 2007;[*citation needed*] it returned in 2008 before being removed again in 2010.[*citation needed*] Another version of this logo without the \"Broadcast Yourself\" slogan was used until 2011.\nYouTube began as a venture capital–funded technology startup. Between November 2005 and April 2006, the company raised money from various investors, with Sequoia Capital and Artis Capital Management being the largest two.[14][21] YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California.[22] In February 2005, the company activated `www.youtube.com`.[23] The first video was uploaded on April 23, 2005. Titled \"Me at the zoo\", it shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site.[24][25] In May, the company launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views.[26][27] The site launched officially on December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day.[28][29] Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30 seconds of footage.[30]\n\n\nYouTube was not the first video-sharing site on the Internet; Vimeo was launched in November 2004, though that site remained a side project of its developers from CollegeHumor.[31] The week of YouTube's launch, NBC-Universal's *Saturday Night Live* ran a skit \"Lazy Sunday\" by The Lonely Island. Besides helping to bolster ratings and long-term viewership for *Saturday Night Live*, \"Lazy Sunday\"'s status as an early viral video helped establish YouTube as an important website.[32] Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February 2006 before they were removed when NBCUniversal requested it two months later based on copyright concerns.[33] Despite eventually being taken down, these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube's reach and led to the upload of more third-party content.[34][35] The site grew rapidly; in July 2006, the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.[36]\n\n\nThe choice of the name `www.youtube.com` led to problems for a similarly named website, `www.utube.com`. That site's owner, Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment, filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November 2006 after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube. Universal Tube subsequently changed its website to `www.utubeonline.com`.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Broadcast Yourself era (2006–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California\nOn October 9, 2006, Google announced that it had acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock.[39][40] The deal was finalized on November 13, 2006.[41][42] Google's acquisition launched newfound interest in video-sharing sites; IAC, which now owned Vimeo, focused on supporting the content creators to distinguish itself from YouTube.[31] It is at this time YouTube issued the slogan \"Broadcast Yourself\".\nThe company experienced rapid growth. *The Daily Telegraph* wrote that in 2007, YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000.[43] By 2010, the company had reached a market share of around 43% and more than 14 billion views of videos, according to comScore.[44] That year, the company simplified its interface to increase the time users would spend on the site.[45] In 2011, more than three billion videos were being watched each day with 48 hours of new videos uploaded every minute.[46][47][48] However, most of these views came from a relatively small number of videos; according to a software engineer at that time, 30% of videos accounted for 99% of views on the site.[49] That year, the company again changed its interface and at the same time, introduced a new logo with a darker shade of red.[50][51] A subsequent interface change, designed to unify the experience across desktop, TV, and mobile, was rolled out in 2013.[52] By that point, more than 100 hours were being uploaded every minute, increasing to 300 hours by November 2014.[53][54]\n\n\n\n![](image)YouTube logo from 2015 until 2017\nDuring this time, the company also went through some organizational changes. In October 2006, YouTube moved to a new office in San Bruno, California.[55] Hurley announced that he would be stepping down as a chief executive officer of YouTube to take an advisory role and that Salar Kamangar would take over as head of the company in October 2010.[56]\n\n\nIn December 2009, YouTube partnered with Vevo.[57] In April 2010, Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" became the most viewed video, becoming the first video to reach 200 million views on May 9, 2010.[58]\n\n\n\n### Susan Wojcicki and going mainstream (2014–2018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)YouTube logo since 2017\nSusan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube in February 2014.[59] In January 2016, YouTube expanded its headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for $215 million. The complex has 51,468 square metres (554,000 square feet) of space and can house up to 2,800 employees.[60] YouTube officially launched the \"polymer\" redesign of its user interfaces based on Material Design language as its default, as well a redesigned logo that is built around the service's play button emblem in August 2017.[61]\n\n\nThrough this period, YouTube tried several new ways to generate revenue beyond advertisements. In 2013, YouTube launched a pilot program for content providers to offer premium, subscription-based channels.[62][63] This effort was discontinued in January 2018 and relaunched in June, with US$4.99 channel subscriptions.[64][65] These channel subscriptions complemented the existing Super Chat ability, launched in 2017, which allows viewers to donate between $1 and $500 to have their comment highlighted.[66] In 2014, YouTube announced a subscription service known as \"Music Key,\" which bundled ad-free streaming of music content on YouTube with the existing Google Play Music service.[67] The service continued to evolve in 2015 when YouTube announced YouTube Red, a new premium service that would offer ad-free access to all content on the platform (succeeding the Music Key service released the previous year), premium original series, and films produced by YouTube personalities, as well as background playback of content on mobile devices. YouTube also released YouTube Music, a third app oriented towards streaming and discovering the music content hosted on the YouTube platform.[68][69][70]\n\n\nThe company also attempted to create products appealing to specific viewers. YouTube released a mobile app known as YouTube Kids in 2015, designed to provide an experience optimized for children. It features a simplified user interface, curated selections of channels featuring age-appropriate content, and parental control features.[71] Also in 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gaming—a video gaming-oriented vertical and app for videos and live streaming, intended to compete with the Amazon.com-owned Twitch.[72]\n\n\nThe company was attacked on April 3, 2018, when a shooting occurred at YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California, which wounded four and resulted in the death of the shooter.[73]\n\n\n\n### Recent history (2019–present)[edit]\n\n\nBy February 2017, one billion hours of YouTube videos were being watched every day, and 400 hours worth of videos were uploaded every minute.[9][74] Two years later, the uploads had risen to more than 500 hours per minute.[10] During the COVID-19 pandemic, when most of the world was under stay-at-home orders, usage of services like YouTube significantly increased. One data firm[*which?*] estimated that YouTube was accounting for 15% of all internet traffic, twice its pre-pandemic level.[75] In response to EU officials requesting that such services reduce bandwidth as to make sure medical entities had sufficient bandwidth to share information, YouTube and Netflix stated they would reduce streaming quality for at least thirty days as to cut bandwidth use of their services by 25% to comply with the EU's request.[76] YouTube later announced that they would continue with this move worldwide: \"We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation.\"[77]\n\n\nFollowing a 2018 complaint alleging violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),[78] the company was fined $170 million by the FTC for collecting personal information from minors under the age of 13.[79] YouTube was also ordered to create systems to increase children's privacy.[80][81] Following criticisms of its implementation of those systems, YouTube started treating all videos designated as \"made for kids\" as liable under COPPA on January 6, 2020.[82][83] Joining the YouTube Kids app, the company created a supervised mode, designed more for tweens, in 2021.[84] Additionally, to compete with TikTok, YouTube released YouTube Shorts, a short-form video platform.\n\n\nDuring this period, YouTube entered disputes with other tech companies. For over a year, in 2018 and 2019, no YouTube app was available for Amazon Fire products.[85] In 2020, Roku removed the YouTube TV app from its streaming store after the two companies were unable to reach an agreement.[86]\n\n\nAfter testing earlier in 2021, YouTube removed public display of dislike counts on videos in November 2021, claiming the reason for the removal was, based on its internal research, that users often used the dislike feature as a form of cyberbullying and brigading.[87] While some users praised the move as a way to discourage trolls, others felt that hiding dislikes would make it harder for viewers to recognize clickbait or unhelpful videos and that other features already existed for creators to limit bullying. YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim referred to the update as \"a stupid idea\", and that the real reason behind the change was \"not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed.\" He felt that users' ability on a social platform to identify harmful content was essential, saying, \"The process works, and there's a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines.\"[88][89][90] Shortly after the announcement, software developer Dmitry Selivanov created Return YouTube Dislike, an open-source, third-party browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that allows users to see a video's number of dislikes.[91] In a letter published on January 25, 2022, by then YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, acknowledged that removing public dislike counts was a controversial decision, but reiterated that she stands by this decision, claiming that \"it reduced dislike attacks.\"[92]\n\n\nIn 2022, YouTube launched an experiment where the company would show users who watched longer videos on TVs a long chain of short unskippable adverts, intending to consolidate all ads into the beginning of a video. Following public outrage over the unprecedented amount of unskippable ads, YouTube \"ended\" the experiment on September 19 of that year.[93] In October, YouTube announced that they would be rolling out customizable user handles (e.g. @MrBeast6000) in addition to channel names, which would also become channel URLs.[94]\n\n\nOn February 16, 2023, Wojcicki announced that she would step down as CEO, with Neal Mohan named as her successor. Wojcicki will take on an advisory role for Google and parent company Alphabet.[95]\n\n\nIn late October 2023, YouTube began cracking down on the use of ad blockers on the platform. Users of ad blockers may be given a pop-up warning saying \"Video player will be blocked after 3 videos\". Users of ad blockers are shown a message inviting them to subscribe to YouTube Premium. YouTube says that the use of ad blockers violates its terms of service.[96][97]\n\n\n\n## Senior leadership[edit]\n\n\nYouTube has been led by a CEO since its founding in 2005, beginning with Chad Hurley, who led the company until 2010. After Google's acquisition of YouTube, the CEO role was retained. Salar Kamangar took over Hurley's position and held the job until 2014. He was replaced by Susan Wojcicki, who later resigned in 2023.[95] The current CEO is Neal Mohan, who was appointed on February 16, 2023.[95]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n### Video technology[edit]\n\n\nYouTube primarily uses the VP9 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video codecs, and the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP protocol.[98] MPEG-4 Part 2 streams contained within 3GP containers are also provided for low bandwidth connections.[99] By January 2019, YouTube had begun rolling out videos in AV1 format.[100] In 2021 it was reported that the company was considering requiring AV1 in streaming hardware in order to decrease bandwidth and increase quality.[101] Video is usually streamed alongside the Opus and AAC audio codecs.[99]\n\n\nAt launch in 2005, viewing YouTube videos on a personal computer required the Adobe Flash Player plug-in to be installed in the browser.[102] In January 2010, YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of Web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard.[103] This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed.[104] On January 27, 2015, YouTube announced that HTML5 would be the default playback method on supported browsers.[103] HTML5 video streams use Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MPEG-DASH), an HTTP-based adaptive bit-rate streaming solution optimizes the bitrate and quality for the available network.[105]\n\n\nThe platform can serve videos at optionally lower resolution levels starting at 144p for smoothening playback in areas and countries with limited Internet speeds, improving compatibility, as well as for the preservation of limited cellular data plans. The resolution can be adjusted automatically based on detected connection speed or set manually.[106][107]\n\n\nFrom 2008 to 2017, users could add \"annotations\" to their videos, such as pop-up text messages and hyperlinks, which allowed for interactive videos. By 2019 all annotations had been removed from videos, breaking some videos that depended on the feature. YouTube introduced standardized widgets intended to replace annotations in a cross-platform manner, including \"end screens\" (a customizable array of thumbnails for specified videos displayed near the end of the video).[108][109][110]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube became an International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI) registry, and announced its intention to begin creating ISNI identifiers to uniquely identify the musicians whose videos it features.[111]\n\n\nUsers can verify their account, normally through a mobile phone, to gain the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as produce live streams.[112][113] Users who have built sufficient channel history and have a good track record of complying with the site's Community Guidelines will also gain access to these aforementioned features as well.[114] When YouTube was launched in 2005, it was possible to upload longer videos, but a 10-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films.[115] The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010.[116] Videos can be at most 256 GB in size or 12 hours, whichever is less.[112] As of 2021[update], automatic closed captions using speech recognition technology when a video is uploaded are available in 13 languages, and can be machine-translated during playback.[117]\n\n\nYouTube also offers manual closed captioning as part of its creator studio.[118] YouTube formerly offered a 'Community Captions' feature, where viewers could write and submit captions for public display upon approval by the video uploader, but this was deprecated in September 2020.[119]\n\n\nYouTube accepts the most common container formats, including MP4, Matroska, FLV, AVI, WebM, 3GP, MPEG-PS, and the QuickTime File Format. Some intermediate video formats (i.e., primarily used for professional video editing, not for final delivery or storage) are also accepted, such as ProRes.[120] YouTube provides recommended encoding settings.[121]\n\n\nEach video is identified by an eleven-character case-sensitive alphanumerical Base64 string in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which can contain letters, digits, an underscore (`_`), and a dash (`-`).[122]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube added a feature called *Premiere* which displays a notification to the user mentioning when the video will be available for the first time, like for a live stream but with a prerecorded video. When the scheduled time arrives, the video is aired as a live broadcast with a two-minute countdown. Optionally, a premiere can be initiated immediately.[123]\n\n\n\n#### Quality and formats[edit]\n\n\nYouTube originally offered videos at only one quality level, displayed at a resolution of 320×240 pixels using the Sorenson Spark codec (a variant of H.263),[124][125] with mono MP3 audio.[126] In June 2007, YouTube added an option to watch videos in 3GP format on mobile phones.[127] In March 2008, a high-quality mode was added, which increased the resolution to 480×360 pixels.[128] In December 2008, 720p HD support was added. At the time of the 720p launch, the YouTube player was changed from a 4:3 aspect ratio to a widescreen 16:9.[129] With this new feature, YouTube began a switchover to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as its default video compression format. In November 2009, 1080p HD support was added. In July 2010, YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in 4K format, which allows a resolution of up to 4096×3072 pixels.[130][131] In July 2010, support for 4K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 3840 × 2160 pixels.[132] In June 2015, support for 8K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 7680×4320 pixels.[133] In November 2016, support for HDR video was added which can be encoded with hybrid log–gamma (HLG) or perceptual quantizer (PQ).[134] HDR video can be encoded with the Rec. 2020 color space.[135]\n\n\nIn June 2014, YouTube began to deploy support for high frame rate videos up to 60 frames per second (as opposed to 30 before), becoming available for user uploads in October. YouTube stated that this would enhance \"motion-intensive\" videos, such as video game footage.[136][137][138][139]\n\n\nYouTube videos are available in a range of quality levels. Viewers only indirectly influence the video quality. In the mobile apps, users choose between \"Auto\", which adjusts resolution based on the internet connection, \"High Picture Quality\" which will prioritize playing high-quality video, \"Data saver\" which will sacrifice video quality in favor of low data usage and \"Advanced\" which lets the user choose a stream resolution.[140] On desktop, users choose between \"Auto\" and a specific resolution.[141] It is not possible for the viewer to directly choose a higher bitrate (quality) for any selected resolution.\n\n\nSince 2009, viewers have had the ability to watch 3D videos.[142] In 2015, YouTube began natively supporting 360-degree video. Since April 2016, it allowed live streaming 360° video, and both normal and 360° video at up to 1440p, and since November 2016 both at up to 4K (2160p) resolution.[143][144][145] Citing the limited number of users who watched more than 90-degrees, it began supporting an alternative stereoscopic video format known as VR180 which it said was easier to produce,[146] which allows users to watch any video using virtual reality headsets.[147]\n\n\nIn response to increased viewership during the COVID-19 pandemic, YouTube temporarily downgraded the quality of its videos.[148][149] YouTube developed its own chip, called Argos, to help with encoding higher resolution videos in 2021.[150]\n\n\nIn certain cases, YouTube allows the uploader to upgrade the quality of videos uploaded a long time ago in poor quality. One such partnership with Universal Music Group included remasters of 1,000 music videos.[151]\n\n\n\n#### Live streaming[edit]\n\n\nYouTube carried out early experiments with live streaming, including its YouTube Live event in 2008,[152] a concert by U2 in 2009, and a question-and-answer session with US President Barack Obama in February 2010.[153] These tests had relied on technology from 3rd-party partners, but in September 2010, YouTube began testing its own live streaming infrastructure.[154] In April 2011, YouTube announced the rollout of *YouTube Live*. The creation of live streams was initially limited to select partners.[155] It was used for real-time broadcasting of events such as the 2012 Olympics in London.[156] In October 2012, more than 8 million people watched Felix Baumgartner's jump from the edge of space as a live stream on YouTube.[157]\n\n\nIn May 2013, creation of live streams was opened to verified users with at least 1,000 subscribers; in August of the same year the number was reduced to 100 subscribers,[158] and in December the limit was removed.[159] In February 2017, live streaming was introduced to the official YouTube mobile app. Live streaming via mobile was initially restricted to users with at least 10,000 subscribers,[160] but as of mid-2017 it has been reduced to 100 subscribers.[161] Live streams support HDR, can be up to 4K resolution at 60 fps, and also support 360° video.[144][162]\n\n\n\n### User features[edit]\n\n\n#### Comment system [edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Google § YouTube user comments\n\nMost videos enable users to leave comments, which have attracted attention for the negative aspects of their form and content.[*specify*] In 2006, *Time* praised Web 2.0 for enabling \"community and collaboration on a scale never seen before\", and added that YouTube \"harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom. Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone, never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred\".[163] *The Guardian* in 2009 described users' comments on YouTube as:[164]\n\n\n\n\n> Juvenile, aggressive, misspelt, sexist, homophobic, swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a LOL, YouTube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance—with the occasional burst of wit shining through.\n> \n> \n\n\n*The Daily Telegraph* commented in September 2008, that YouTube was \"notorious\" for \"some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet\", and reported on YouTube Comment Snob, \"a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts\".[165] *The Huffington Post* noted in April 2012 that finding comments on YouTube that appear \"offensive, stupid and crass\" to the \"vast majority\" of the people is hardly difficult.[166]\n\n\nGoogle subsequently implemented a comment system oriented on Google+ on November 6, 2013, that required all YouTube users to use a Google+ account to comment on videos. The stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments, thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone.[167] The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments, which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse.[168][169] In response, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question \"why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video?\" on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change.[170] The official YouTube announcement[171] received 20,097 \"thumbs down\" votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days.[172] Writing in the *Newsday* blog Silicon Island, Chase Melvin noted that \"Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network like Facebook, but it's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don't want to lose their ability to comment on videos\" and added that \"Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with the outcry against the new comment system\". In the same article Melvin goes on to say:[173]\n\n\n\n\n> Perhaps user complaints are justified, but the idea of revamping the old system isn't so bad.\n> Think of the crude, misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on YouTube without any discernible moderation. Isn't any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot? The system is far from perfect, but Google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate YouTubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity.\n> \n> \n\n\nLater, on July 27, 2015, Google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a Google+ account to post comments to YouTube.[174] On November 3, 2016, YouTube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve, hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments.[175] Creators may also choose to keep or delete comments with links or hashtags in order to combat spam. They can also allow other users to moderate their comments.[176]\n\n\nIn December 2020, it was reported that YouTube would launch a new feature that will warn users who post a comment that \"may be offensive to others.\"[177][178]\n\n\n\n#### Community[edit]\n\n\nOn September 13, 2016, YouTube launched a public beta of Community, a social media-based feature that allows users to post text, images (including GIFs), live videos and others in a separate \"Community\" tab on their channel.[179] Prior to the release, several creators had been consulted to suggest tools Community could incorporate that they would find useful; these YouTubers included Vlogbrothers, AsapScience, Lilly Singh, The Game Theorists, Karmin, The Key of Awesome, The Kloons, Peter Hollens, Rosianna Halse Rojas, Sam Tsui, Threadbanger and Vsauce3.[180][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\nAfter the feature has been officially released, the *community post* feature gets activated automatically for every channel that passes a specific threshold of subscriber counts or already has more subscribers. This threshold was lowered over time,[*when?*] from 10,000 subscribers to 1500 subscribers, to 1000 subscribers,[181][*non-primary source needed*] to 500 subscribers.[182]\n\n\nChannels that the community tab becomes enabled for, get their channel discussions (previously known as channel comments) permanently erased, instead of co-existing or migrating.[183][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n#### TestTube[edit]\n\n\nExperimental features of YouTube can be accessed in an area of the site named *TestTube*.[184][185]\n\n\nFor example, in October 2009, a *comment search* feature accessible under `/comment_search` was implemented as part of this program. The feature was removed later.[186]\n\n\nLater the same year, *YouTube Feather* was introduced as a \"lightweight\" alternative website for countries with limited internet speeds.[187]\n\n\n\n### Content accessibility[edit]\n\n\nYouTube offers users the ability to view its videos on web pages outside their website. Each YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of HTML that can be used to embed it on any page on the Web.[188] This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in social networking pages and blogs. Users wishing to post a video discussing, inspired by, or related to another user's video can make a \"video response\". The eleven character YouTube video identifier (64 possible characters used in each position), allows for a theoretical maximum of 6411 or around 73.8 quintillion (73.8 billion billion) unique ids.\n\n\nYouTube announced that it would remove video responses for being an underused feature on August 27, 2013.[189] Embedding, rating, commenting and response posting can be disabled by the video owner.[190] YouTube does not usually offer a download link for its videos, and intends for them to be viewed through its website interface.[191] A small number of videos can be downloaded as MP4 files.[192] Numerous third-party web sites, applications and browser plug-ins allow users to download YouTube videos.[193]\n\n\nIn February 2009, YouTube announced a test service, allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through Google Checkout.[194] In June 2012, Google sent cease and desist letters threatening legal action against several websites offering online download and conversion of YouTube videos.[195] In response, Zamzar removed the ability to download YouTube videos from its site.[196] Users retain copyright of their own work under the default Standard YouTube License,[197] but have the option to grant certain usage rights under any public copyright license they choose.\n\n\nSince July 2012, it has been possible to select a Creative Commons attribution license as the default, allowing other users to reuse and remix the material.[198]\n\n\n\n#### Platforms[edit]\n\n\nMost modern smartphones are capable of accessing YouTube videos, either within an application or through an optimized website. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, using RTSP streaming for the video.[199] Not all of YouTube's videos are available on the mobile version of the site.[200]\n\n\nSince June 2007, YouTube's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products. This required YouTube's content to be transcoded into Apple's preferred video standard, H.264, a process that took several months. YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV, iPod Touch and the iPhone.[201]\n\n\nThe mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5 in July 2010, avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls.[202] The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform.[203][204]\n\n\nIn September 2012, YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone, following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system.[205] According to GlobalWebIndex, YouTube was used by 35% of smartphone users between April and June 2013, making it the third-most used app.[206]\n\n\nA TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos.[207]\n\n\nIn January 2009, YouTube launched \"YouTube for TV\", a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers, initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles.[208][209]\n\n\nDuring the month of June that same year, YouTube XL was introduced, which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen.[210] YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live.[211]\n\n\nOn November 15, 2012, Google launched an official app for the Wii, allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel.[212] An app was available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, but was discontinued in August 2019.[213] Videos can also be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5.[214][*non-primary source needed*] Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17, 2013,[215] and, in October 2014, the Sony PlayStation 4.[216]\n\n\nYouTube launched as a downloadable app for the Nintendo Switch in November 2018.[217]\n\n\n\n### International and localization[edit]\n\n\nOn June 19, 2007, Google CEO Eric Schmidt appeared in Paris to launch the new localization system.[218] The interface of the website is available with localized versions in 104 countries, one territory (Hong Kong) and a worldwide version.[219]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

chosen based on the IP address of the user. In some cases, the message \"This video is not available in your country\" may appear because of copyright restrictions or inappropriate content.[268] The interface of the YouTube website is available in 76 language versions, including Amharic, Albanian, Armenian, Burmese, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, Persian and Uzbek, which do not have local channel versions. Access to YouTube was blocked in Turkey between 2008 and 2010, following controversy over the posting of videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and some material offensive to Muslims.[269][270] In October 2012, a local version of YouTube was launched in Turkey, with the domain `youtube.com.tr`. The local version is subject to the content regulations found in Turkish law.[271] In March 2009, a dispute between YouTube and the British royalty collection agency PRS for Music led to premium music videos being blocked for YouTube users in the United Kingdom. The removal of videos posted by the major record companies occurred after failure to reach an agreement on a licensing deal. The dispute was resolved in September 2009.[272] In April 2009, a similar dispute led to the removal of premium music videos for users in Germany.[273]\n\n\n\n## Videos[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2012, it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site, in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical US citizen watching television.[274] In 2017, viewers on average watched YouTube on mobile devices for more than an hour every day.[275]\n\n\nIn December 2012, two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and Sony music videos on YouTube, prompting a claim by *The Daily Dot* that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site's terms of service, which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts. This was disputed by *Billboard*, which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo, since the videos were no longer active on YouTube.[276][277] On August 5, 2015, YouTube patched the formerly notorious behaviour which caused a video's view count to freeze at \"301\" (later \"301+\") until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud.[278] YouTube view counts once again updated in real time.[279]\n\n\nSince September 2019, subscriber counts are abbreviated. Only three leading digits of channels' subscriber counts are indicated publicly, compromising the function of third-party real-time indicators such as that of Social Blade. Exact counts remain available to channel operators inside YouTube Studio.[280]\n\n\nOn November 11, 2021, after testing out this change in March of the same year, YouTube announced it would start hiding dislike counts on videos, making them invisible to viewers. The company stated the decision was in response to experiments which confirmed that smaller YouTube creators were more likely to be targeted in dislike brigading and harassment. Creators will still be able to see the number of likes and dislikes in the YouTube Studio dashboard tool, according to YouTube.[281][282][283]\n\n\n\n### Copyright issues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube copyright issues\n\nFurther information: § Revenue to copyright holders\n\nYouTube has faced numerous challenges and criticisms in its attempts to deal with copyright, including the site's first viral video, Lazy Sunday, which had to be taken down, due to copyright concerns.[32] At the time of uploading a video, YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws.[284] Despite this advice, many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material remain on YouTube. YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act. Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike. Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted.[285][286] From 2007 to 2009 organizations including Viacom, Mediaset, and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material.[287][288][289]\n\n\nIn August 2008, a US court ruled in *Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.* that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the material.[290] YouTube's owner Google announced in November 2015 that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe fair use defenses apply.[291]\n\n\nIn the 2011 case of *Smith v. Summit Entertainment LLC*, professional singer Matt Smith sued Summit Entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notices on YouTube.[292] He asserted seven causes of action, and four were ruled in Smith's favor.[293] In April 2012, a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users.[294] On November 1, 2016, the dispute with GEMA was resolved, with Google content ID being used to allow advertisements to be added to videos with content protected by GEMA.[295]\n\n\nIn April 2013, it was reported that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored, even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA counter-notice.[296][297] As part of YouTube Music, Universal and YouTube signed an agreement in 2017, which was followed by separate agreements other major labels, which gave the company the right to advertising revenue when its music was played on YouTube.[298] By 2019, creators were having videos taken down or demonetized when Content ID identified even short segments of copyrighted music within a much longer video, with different levels of enforcement depending on the record label.[299] Experts noted that some of these clips said qualified for fair use.[299]\n\n\n\n#### Content ID[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Content ID (system)\n\nIn June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright. Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute.[300] The system, which was initially called \"Video Identification\"[301][302] and later became known as Content ID,[303] creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found.[304] When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video.\n\n\nAn independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube and concluded that while the system was \"surprisingly resilient\" in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos, it was not infallible.[305] The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use.[306] If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision.[307]\n\n\nBefore 2016, videos were not monetized until the dispute was resolved. Since April 2016, videos continue to be monetized while the dispute is in progress, and the money goes to whoever won the dispute.[308] Should the uploader want to monetize the video again, they may remove the disputed audio in the \"Video Manager\".[309] YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length.[310]\n\n\n\n### Moderation and offensive content[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Google § YouTube, and Censorship by Google § YouTube\n\nYouTube has a set of community guidelines aimed to reduce abuse of the site's features. The uploading of videos containing defamation, pornography, and material encouraging criminal conduct is forbidden by YouTube's \"Community Guidelines\".[311][*better source needed*] Generally prohibited material includes sexually explicit content, videos of animal abuse, shock videos, content uploaded without the copyright holder's consent, hate speech, spam, and predatory behavior.[311] YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate, and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site's guidelines.[311] Despite the guidelines, YouTube has faced criticism over aspects of its operations,[312] its recommendation algorithms perpetuating videos that promote conspiracy theories and falsehoods,[313] hosting videos ostensibly targeting children but containing violent or sexually suggestive content involving popular characters,[314] videos of minors attracting pedophilic activities in their comment sections,[315] and fluctuating policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized with advertising.[312]\n\n\nYouTube contracts companies to hire content moderators, who view content flagged as potentially violating YouTube's content policies and determines if they should be removed. In September 2020, a class-action suit was filed by a former content moderator who reported developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after an 18-month period on the job. The former content moderator said that she was regularly made to exceed YouTube's stated limit of four hours per day of viewing graphic content. The lawsuit alleges that YouTube's contractors gave little to no training or support for its moderators' mental health, made prospective employees sign NDAs before showing them any examples of content they would see while reviewing, and censored all mention of trauma from its internal forums. It also purports that requests for extremely graphic content to be blurred, reduced in size or made monochrome, per recommendations from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, were rejected by YouTube as not a high priority for the company.[316][317][318]\n\n\nTo limit the spread of misinformation and fake news via YouTube, it has rolled out a comprehensive policy regarding how it plans to deal with technically manipulated videos.[319]\n\n\nControversial content has included material relating to Holocaust denial and the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 football fans from Liverpool were crushed to death in 1989.[320][321] In July 2008, the Culture and Media Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom stated that it was \"unimpressed\" with YouTube's system for policing its videos, and argued that \"proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content\". YouTube responded by stating:\n\n\n\n\n> We have strict rules on what's allowed, and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24/7 review team and have it dealt with promptly. We educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every YouTube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users. Given the volume of content uploaded on our site, we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly.[322] (July 2008)\n> \n> \n\n\nIn October 2010, U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner urged YouTube to remove from its website videos of imam Anwar al-Awlaki.[323] YouTube pulled some of the videos in November 2010, stating they violated the site's guidelines.[324] In December 2010, YouTube added the ability to flag videos for containing terrorism content.[325]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube introduced a system that would automatically add information boxes to videos that its algorithms determined may present conspiracy theories and other fake news, filling the infobox with content from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia as a means to inform users to minimize misinformation propagation without impacting freedom of speech.[326][327] In the wake of the Notre-Dame fire on April 15, 2019, several user-uploaded videos of the landmark fire were flagged by YouTube' system automatically with an Encyclopædia Britannica article on the false conspiracy theories around the September 11 attacks. Several users complained to YouTube about this inappropriate connection. YouTube officials apologized for this, stating that their algorithms had misidentified the fire videos and added the information block automatically, and were taking steps to remedy this.[328]\n\n\nOn April 18, 2023, YouTube revealed its changes in handling content associated with eating disorders. This social media platform's Community Guidelines now prohibit content that could encourage emulation from at-risk users. This content includes behavior that shows severe calorie tracking and purging after eating. However, videos featuring positive behavior such as in the context of recovery will be permitted on the platform under two conditions—the user must have a registered (logged-in) account and must be older than 18.\nThis policy was created in collaboration with nonprofit organizations as well as the National Eating Disorder Association. Garth Graham, YouTube's Global Head of Healthcare revealed in an interview with CNN that this policy change was geared at ensuring that this video-sharing platform provides an avenue for \"community recovery and resources\" while ensuring continued viewer protection.[329]\n\n\n\n#### Homophobia and transphobia[edit]\n\n\nFive leading content creators whose channels were based on LGBTQ+ materials filed a federal lawsuit against YouTube in August 2019, alleging that YouTube's algorithms divert discovery away from their channels, impacting their revenue. The plaintiffs claimed that the algorithms discourage content with words like \"lesbian\" or \"gay\", which would be predominant in their channels' content, and because of YouTube's near-monopolization of online video services, they are abusing that position.[330]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Media Matters, a media watchdog group, reported that homophobic and transphobic content calling LGBT people \"predators\" and \"groomers\" was becoming more common on YouTube.[331] The report also referred to common accusations in YouTube videos that LGBT people are mentally ill.[331] The report stated the content appeared to be in violation of YouTube's hate speech policy.[331]\n\n\n\n#### Animal torture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(July 2023)*\n |\n\n\nYouTube said animal abuse \"has no place on their platforms, and they are working to remove content\".[332][333][334][335][336][337]\n\n\n\n#### YouTube as a tool to promote conspiracy theories and far-right content[edit]\n\n\nYouTube has been criticized for using an algorithm that gives great prominence to videos that promote conspiracy theories, falsehoods and incendiary fringe discourse.[338][339][340] According to an investigation by *The Wall Street Journal*, \"YouTube's recommendations often lead users to channels that feature conspiracy theories, partisan viewpoints and misleading videos, even when those users haven't shown interest in such content. When users show a political bias in what they choose to view, YouTube typically recommends videos that echo those biases, often with more-extreme viewpoints.\"[338][341] When users search for political or scientific terms, YouTube's search algorithms often give prominence to hoaxes and conspiracy theories.[340][342] After YouTube drew controversy for giving top billing to videos promoting falsehoods and conspiracy when people made breaking-news queries during the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, YouTube changed its algorithm to give greater prominence to mainstream media sources.[338][343][344][345] In 2018, it was reported that YouTube was again promoting fringe content about breaking news, giving great prominence to conspiracy videos about Anthony Bourdain's death.[346]\n\n\nIn 2017, it was revealed that advertisements were being placed on extremist videos, including videos by rape apologists, anti-Semites, and hate preachers who received ad payouts.[347] After firms started to stop advertising on YouTube in the wake of this reporting, YouTube apologized and said that it would give firms greater control over where ads got placed.[347]\n\n\nAlex Jones, known for right-wing conspiracy theories, had built a massive audience on YouTube.[348] YouTube drew criticism in 2018 when it removed a video from Media Matters compiling offensive statements made by Jones, stating that it violated its policies on \"harassment and bullying\".[349] On August 6, 2018, however, YouTube removed Alex Jones' YouTube page following a content violation.[350]\n\n\nUniversity of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci has referred to YouTube as \"The Great Radicalizer\", saying \"YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century.\"[351] Jonathan Albright of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University described YouTube as a \"conspiracy ecosystem\".[340][352]\n\n\nIn January 2019, YouTube said that it had introduced a new policy starting in the United States intended to stop recommending videos containing \"content that could misinform users in harmful ways.\" YouTube gave flat earth theories, miracle cures, and 9/11 trutherism as examples.[353] Efforts within YouTube engineering to stop recommending borderline extremist videos falling just short of forbidden hate speech, and track their popularity were originally rejected because they could interfere with viewer engagement.[354] In late 2019, the site began implementing measures directed towards \"raising authoritative content and reducing borderline content and harmful misinformation.\"[355]\n\n\nMultiple research studies have investigated cases of misinformation in YouTube. In a July 2019 study based on ten YouTube searches using the Tor Browser related to climate and climate change, the majority of videos were videos that communicated views contrary to the scientific consensus on climate change.[356] A May 2023 study found that YouTube was monetizing and profiting from videos that included misinformation about climate change.[357] A 2019 BBC investigation of YouTube searches in ten different languages found that YouTube's algorithm promoted health misinformation, including fake cancer cures.[358] In Brazil, YouTube has been linked to pushing pseudoscientific misinformation on health matters, as well as elevated far-right fringe discourse and conspiracy theories.[359] In the Philippines, numerous channels disseminated misinformation related to the 2022 Philippine elections.[360] Additionally, research on the dissemination of Flat Earth beliefs in social media, has shown that networks of YouTube channels form an echo chamber that polarizes audiences by appearing to confirm preexisting beliefs.[361]\n\n\n\n#### Use among white supremacists[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2019, YouTube took steps to remove specific videos or channels related to supremacist content that had violated its acceptable use policies but otherwise did not have site-wide policies against hate speech.[362]\n\n\nIn the wake of the March 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks, YouTube and other sites like Facebook and Twitter that allowed user-submitted content drew criticism for doing little to moderate and control the spread of hate speech, which was considered to be a factor in the rationale for the attacks.[363][364] These platforms were pressured to remove such content, but in an interview with *The New York Times*, YouTube's chief product officer Neal Mohan said that unlike content such as ISIS videos which take a particular format and thus easy to detect through computer-aided algorithms, general hate speech was more difficult to recognize and handle, and thus could not readily take action to remove without human interaction.[365]\n\n\nYouTube joined an initiative led by France and New Zealand with other countries and tech companies in May 2019 to develop tools to be used to block online hate speech and to develop regulations, to be implemented at the national level, to be levied against technology firms that failed to take steps to remove such speech, though the United States declined to participate.[366][367] Subsequently, on June 5, 2019, YouTube announced a major change to its terms of service, \"specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status.\" YouTube identified specific examples of such videos as those that \"promote or glorify Nazi ideology, which is inherently discriminatory\". YouTube further stated it would \"remove content denying that well-documented violent events, like the Holocaust or the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, took place.\"[362][368]\n\n\nIn October 2019, YouTube banned the main channel of Red Ice, a white supremacist multimedia company, for hate speech violations. The channel had about 330,000 subscribers. Lana Lokteff and Red Ice promoted a backup channel in an attempt to circumvent the ban.[369][370] A week later, the backup channel was also removed by YouTube.[371][372]\n\n\nIn June 2020, YouTube banned several channels associated with white supremacy, including those of Stefan Molyneux, David Duke, and Richard B. Spencer, asserting these channels violated their policies on hate speech. The ban occurred the same day that Reddit announced the ban on several hate speech sub-forums including r/The Donald.[373]\n\n\n\n#### Handling of COVID-19 pandemic and other misinformation[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the dissemination via YouTube of misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic that 5G communications technology was responsible for the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 which led to multiple 5G towers in the United Kingdom being attacked by arsonists, YouTube removed all such videos linking 5G and the coronavirus in this manner.[374]\n\n\nYouTube extended this policy in September 2021 to cover videos disseminating misinformation related to any vaccine, including those long approved against measles or Hepatitis B, that had received approval from local health authorities or the World Health Organization.[375][376] The platform removed the accounts of anti-vaccine campaigners such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Joseph Mercola at this time.[376] Two accounts linked to RT Deutsch, the German channel of the Russian RT network were removed as well for breaching YouTube's policies.[375]\n\n\nYouTube had extended this moderation to non-medical areas. In the weeks following the 2020 United States presidential election, the site added policies to remove or label videos promoting disproving election fraud claims;[377] however, it reversed this policy in June 2023, citing that the removal was necessary to \"openly debate political ideas, even those that are controversial or based on disproven assumptions\".[378] Google and YouTube implemented policies in October 2021 to deny monetization or revenue to advertisers or content creators that promoted climate change denial, which \"includes content referring to climate change as a hoax or a scam, claims denying that long-term trends show the global climate is warming, and claims denying that greenhouse gas emissions or human activity contribute to climate change.\"[379]\n\n\nIn July 2022 YouTube announced policies to combat misinformation surrounding abortion, such as videos with instructions to perform abortion methods that are considered unsafe and videos that contain misinformation about the safety of abortion.[380]\n\n\n\n#### Child safety and wellbeing[edit]\n\n\nSee also: FamilyOFive, Fantastic Adventures scandal, and Elsagate\n\nLeading into 2017, there was a significant increase in the number of videos related to children, coupled between the popularity of parents vlogging their family's activities, and previous content creators moving away from content that often was criticized or demonetized into family-friendly material. In 2017, YouTube reported that time watching family vloggers had increased by 90%.[381][382] However, with the increase in videos featuring children, the site began to face several controversies related to child safety. During Q2 2017, the owners of popular channel FamilyOFive, which featured themselves playing \"pranks\" on their children, were accused of child abuse. Their videos were eventually deleted, and two of their children were removed from their custody.[383][384][385][386] A similar case happened in 2019 when the owner of the channel Fantastic Adventures was accused of abusing her adopted children. Her videos would later be deleted.[387]\n\n\nLater that year, YouTube came under criticism for showing inappropriate videos targeted at children and often featuring popular characters in violent, sexual or otherwise disturbing situations, many of which appeared on YouTube Kids and attracted millions of views. The term \"Elsagate\" was coined on the Internet and then used by various news outlets to refer to this controversy.[388][389][390][391] On November 11, 2017, YouTube announced it was strengthening site security to protect children from unsuitable content. Later that month, the company started to mass delete videos and channels that made improper use of family-friendly characters. As part of a broader concern regarding child safety on YouTube, the wave of deletions also targeted channels that showed children taking part in inappropriate or dangerous activities under the guidance of adults. Most notably, the company removed *Toy Freaks*, a channel with over 8.5 million subscribers, that featured a father and his two daughters in odd and upsetting situations.[392][393][394][395][396] According to analytics specialist SocialBlade, it earned up to £8.7 million annually prior to its deletion.[397]\n\n\nEven for content that appears to be aimed at children and appears to contain only child-friendly content, YouTube's system allows for anonymity of who uploads these videos. These questions have been raised in the past, as YouTube has had to remove channels with children's content which, after becoming popular, then suddenly include inappropriate content masked as children's content.[398] Alternative, some of the most-watched children's programming on YouTube comes from channels that have no identifiable owners, raising concerns of intent and purpose. One channel that had been of concern was \"Cocomelon\" which provided numerous mass-produced animated videos aimed at children. Up through 2019, it had drawn up to US$10 million a month in ad revenue and was one of the largest kid-friendly channels on YouTube before 2020. Ownership of Cocomelon was unclear outside of its ties to \"Treasure Studio\", itself an unknown entity, raising questions as to the channel's purpose,[398][399][400] but *Bloomberg News* had been able to confirm and interview the small team of American owners in February 2020 regarding \"Cocomelon\", who stated their goal for the channel was to simply entertain children, wanting to keep to themselves to avoid attention from outside investors.[401] The anonymity of such channel raise concerns because of the lack of knowledge of what purpose they are trying to serve.[402] The difficulty to identify who operates these channels \"adds to the lack of accountability\", according to Josh Golin of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, and educational consultant Renée Chernow-O'Leary found the videos were designed to entertain with no intent to educate, all leading to critics and parents to be concerned for their children becoming too enraptured by the content from these channels.[398] Content creators that earnestly make child-friendly videos have found it difficult to compete with larger channels, unable to produce content at the same rate as them, and lacking the same means of being promoted through YouTube's recommendation algorithms that the larger animated channel networks have shared.[402]\n\n\nIn January 2019, YouTube officially banned videos containing \"challenges that encourage acts that have an inherent risk of severe physical harm\" (such as the Tide Pod Challenge) and videos featuring pranks that \"make victims believe they're in physical danger\" or cause emotional distress in children.[403]\n\n\n\n##### Sexualization of children and pedophilia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Elsagate\n\nAlso in November 2017, it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children—often uploaded by the minors themselves, and showing innocent content such as the children playing with toys or performing gymnastics—were attracting comments from pedophiles[404][405] with predators finding the videos through private YouTube playlists or typing in certain keywords in Russian.[405] Other child-centric videos originally uploaded to YouTube began propagating on the dark web, and uploaded or embedded onto forums known to be used by pedophiles.[406]\n\n\nAs a result of the controversy, which added to the concern about \"Elsagate\", several major advertisers whose ads had been running against such videos froze spending on YouTube.[391][407] In December 2018, *The Times* found more than 100 grooming cases in which children were manipulated into sexually implicit behavior (such as taking off clothes, adopting overtly sexual poses and touching other children inappropriately) by strangers.[408] After a reporter flagged the videos in question, half of them were removed, and the rest were removed after *The Times* contacted YouTube's PR department.[408]\n\n\nIn February 2019, YouTube vlogger Matt Watson identified a \"wormhole\" that would cause the YouTube recommendation algorithm to draw users into this type of video content, and make all of that user's recommended content feature only these types of videos.[409] Most of these videos had comments from sexual predators commenting with timestamps of when the children were shown in compromising positions or otherwise making indecent remarks. In some cases, other users had re-uploaded the video in unlisted form but with incoming links from other videos, and then monetized these, propagating this network.[410] In the wake of the controversy, the service reported that they had deleted over 400 channels and tens of millions of comments, and reported the offending users to law enforcement and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. A spokesperson explained that \"any content—including comments—that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube. There's more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly.\"[411][412] Despite these measures, AT&T, Disney, Dr. Oetker, Epic Games, and Nestlé all pulled their advertising from YouTube.[410][413]\n\n\nSubsequently, YouTube began to demonetize and block advertising on the types of videos that have drawn these predatory comments. The service explained that this was a temporary measure while they explore other methods to eliminate the problem.[414] YouTube also began to flag channels that predominantly feature children, and preemptively disable their comments sections. \"Trusted partners\" can request that comments be re-enabled, but the channel will then become responsible for moderating comments. These actions mainly target videos of toddlers, but videos of older children and teenagers may be protected as well if they contain actions that can be interpreted as sexual, such as gymnastics. YouTube stated it was also working on a better system to remove comments on other channels that matched the style of child predators.[415][416]\n\n\nA related attempt to algorithmically flag videos containing references to the string \"CP\" (an abbreviation of child pornography) resulted in some prominent false positives involving unrelated topics using the same abbreviation, including videos related to the mobile video game *Pokémon Go* (which uses \"CP\" as an abbreviation of the statistic \"Combat Power\"), and *Club Penguin*. YouTube apologized for the errors and reinstated the affected videos.[417] Separately, online trolls have attempted to have videos flagged for takedown or removal by commenting with statements similar to what the child predators had said; this activity became an issue during the PewDiePie vs T-Series rivalry in early 2019. YouTube stated they do not take action on any video with these comments but those that they have flagged that are likely to draw child predator activity.[418]\n\n\nIn June 2019, *The New York Times* cited researchers who found that users who watched erotic videos could be recommended seemingly innocuous videos of children.[419] As a result, Senator Josh Hawley stated plans to introduce federal legislation that would ban YouTube and other video sharing sites from including videos that predominantly feature minors as \"recommended\" videos, excluding those that were \"professionally produced\", such as videos of televised talent shows.[420] YouTube has suggested potential plans to remove all videos featuring children from the main YouTube site and transferring them to the YouTube Kids site where they would have stronger controls over the recommendation system, as well as other major changes on the main YouTube site to the recommended feature and autoplay system.[421]\n\n\n\n#### Misogyny[edit]\n\n\nA January 2022 report by the social media analytics firm Bot Sentinel said that several online influencers were using YouTube to exclusively post negative content about Prince Harry and Meghan, including conspiracy theories about the couple, in what it called \"a lucrative hate-for-profit enterprise\" where \"racism and YouTube ad revenue are the primary motivators.\" Bot Sentinel also found that one of the most prominent accounts promoting a conspiracy theory that Meghan was never pregnant had accumulated nearly 19 million views and was earning around $44,000 a year. YouTube banned the account in March.[422]\n\n\nAn August 2022 report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a British think tank, found that harassment against women was flourishing on YouTube. It noted that channels espousing a similar ideology to that of men's rights influencer Andrew Tate were using YouTube to grow their audience, despite Tate being banned from the platform.[423] In his 2022 book *Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise to World Domination*, Bloomberg reporter Mark Bergen said that many female content creators were dealing with harassment, bullying and stalking.[423]\n\n\n\n### April Fools gags[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Google April Fools' Day jokes\n\nYouTube featured an April Fools prank on the site on April 1 of every year from 2008 to 2016. In 2008, all links to videos on the main page were redirected to Rick Astley's music video \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", a prank known as \"rickrolling\".[424][425] The next year, when clicking on a video on the main page, the whole page turned upside down, which YouTube claimed was a \"new layout\".[426] In 2010, YouTube temporarily released a \"TEXTp\" mode which rendered video imagery into ASCII art letters \"in order to reduce bandwidth costs by $1 per second.\"[427]\n\n\nThe next year, the site celebrated its \"100th anniversary\" with a range of sepia-toned silent, early 1900s-style films, including a parody of Keyboard Cat.[428] In 2012, clicking on the image of a DVD next to the site logo led to a video about a purported option to order every YouTube video for home delivery on DVD.[429]\n\n\nIn 2013, YouTube teamed up with satirical newspaper company *The Onion* to claim in an uploaded video that the video-sharing website was launched as a contest which had finally come to an end, and would shut down for ten years before being re-launched in 2023, featuring only the winning video. The video starred several YouTube celebrities, including Antoine Dodson. A video of two presenters announcing the nominated videos streamed live for 12 hours.[430][431]\n\n\nIn 2014, YouTube announced that it was responsible for the creation of all viral video trends, and revealed previews of upcoming trends, such as \"Clocking\", \"Kissing Dad\", and \"Glub Glub Water Dance\".[432] The next year, YouTube added a music button to the video bar that played samples from \"Sandstorm\" by Darude.[433] In 2016, YouTube introduced an option to watch every video on the platform in 360-degree mode with Snoop Dogg.[434]\n\n\n\n## Services[edit]\n\n\n### YouTube Premium[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Premium\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Premium\nYouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) is YouTube's premium subscription service. It offers advertising-free streaming, access to original programming, and background and offline video playback on mobile devices.[435] YouTube Premium was originally announced on November 12, 2014, as \"Music Key\", a subscription music streaming service, and was intended to integrate with and replace the existing Google Play Music \"All Access\" service.[436][437][438] On October 28, 2015, the service was relaunched as YouTube Red, offering ad-free streaming of all videos and access to exclusive original content.[439][440][441] As of November 2016[update], the service has 1.5 million subscribers, with a further million on a free-trial basis.[442] As of June 2017[update], the first season of YouTube Originals had gotten 250 million views in total.[443]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Kids[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Kids\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Kids\nYouTube Kids is an American children's video app developed by YouTube, a subsidiary of Google. The app was developed in response to parental and government scrutiny on the content available to children. The app provides a version of the service-oriented towards children, with curated selections of content, parental control features, and filtering of videos deemed inappropriate viewing for children aged under 13, 8 or 5 depending on the age grouping chosen. First released on February 15, 2015, as an Android and iOS mobile app, the app has since been released for LG, Samsung, and Sony smart TVs, as well as for Android TV. On May 27, 2020, it became available on Apple TV. As of September 2019, the app is available in 69 countries, including Hong Kong and Macau, and one province. YouTube launched a web-based version of YouTube Kids on August 30, 2019.\n\n\n\n### YouTube Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Music\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Music\nOn September 28, 2016, YouTube named Lyor Cohen, the co-founder of 300 Entertainment and former Warner Music Group executive, the Global Head of Music.[444]\n\n\nIn early 2018, Cohen began hinting at the possible launch of YouTube's new subscription music streaming service, a platform that would compete with other services such as Spotify and Apple Music.[445] On May 22, 2018, the music streaming platform named \"YouTube Music\" was launched.[446][447]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Movies[edit]\n\n\nYouTube Movies is a service by YouTube that shows movies via its website. Around 100–500 movies are free to view, with ads. Some new movies get added and some get removed, unannounced at a new month.[448]\n\n\n\n### YouTube TV[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube TV\n\n![](image)YouTube TV logo\nOn February 28, 2017, in a press announcement held at YouTube Space Los Angeles, YouTube announced YouTube TV, an over-the-top MVPD-style subscription service that would be available for United States customers at a price of US$65 per month. Initially launching in five major markets (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco) on April 5, 2017,[449][450] the service offers live streams of programming from the five major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, The CW, Fox and NBC), as well as approximately 40 cable channels owned by the corporate parents of those networks, The Walt Disney Company, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, NBCUniversal and Turner Broadcasting System (including among others Bravo, USA Network, Syfy, Disney Channel, CNN, Cartoon Network, E!, Fox Sports 1, Freeform, FX and ESPN). Subscribers can also receive Showtime and Fox Soccer Plus as optional add-ons for an extra fee, and can access YouTube Premium original content.[451][452]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Go[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Go\nIn September 2016, *YouTube Go* was announced,[453] as an Android app created for making YouTube easier to access on mobile devices in emerging markets. It was distinct from the company's main Android app and allowed videos to be downloaded and shared with other users. It also allowed users to preview videos, share downloaded videos through Bluetooth, and offered more options for mobile data control and video resolution.[454]\n\n\nIn February 2017, *YouTube Go* was launched in India, and expanded in November 2017 to 14 other countries, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Kenya, and South Africa.[455][456] On February 1, 2018, it was rolled out in 130 countries worldwide, including Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, and Iraq. Before it shut down, the app was available to around 60% of the world's population.[457][458] In May 2022, Google announced that they would be shutting down *YouTube Go* in August 2022.[459]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Shorts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Shorts\n\nAn example video that is suitable for YouTube Shorts, showing Crew Dragon *Endeavour* docking at the International Space Station\nIn September 2020, YouTube announced that it would be launching a beta version of a new platform of 15-second videos, similar to TikTok, called YouTube Shorts.[460][461] The platform was first tested in India but as of March 2021 has expanded to other countries including the United States with videos now able to be up to 1 minute long.[462] The platform is not a standalone app, but is integrated into the main YouTube app. Like TikTok, it gives users access to built-in creative tools, including the possibility of adding licensed music to their videos.[463] The platform had its global beta launch in July 2021.[464]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Stories[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube started testing a new feature initially called \"YouTube Reels\".[465] The feature is nearly identical to Instagram Stories and Snapchat Stories. YouTube later renamed the feature \"YouTube Stories\". It is only available to creators who have more than 10,000 subscribers and can only be posted/seen in the YouTube mobile app.[466] On May 25, 2023, YouTube announced that it would be shutting down this feature on June 26, 2023.[467][468]\n\n\n\n## Social impact[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Social impact of YouTube\n\nPrivate individuals[469] and large production corporations[470] have used YouTube to grow their audiences. Indie creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort, while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic.[469] Concurrently, old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television.[470] While YouTube's revenue-sharing \"Partner Program\" made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $100,000 annually[471] and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $2.5 million to $12 million[472]—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as \"a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels.\"[473] In 2013 *Forbes*' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media.[474] Videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as \"mega\", \"mainstream\" and \"mid-sized\" received 90.3% of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo in that year.[475] By early 2013, *Billboard* had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the *Billboard* Hot 100 and related genre charts.[476]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan Hoffner at the 68th Annual Peabody Awards accepting for YouTube\nObserving that face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been \"fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution\", TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that \"what Gutenberg did for writing, online video can now do for face-to-face communication.\"[477] Anderson asserted that it is not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance, and that video contributors may be about to launch \"the biggest learning cycle in human history.\"[477] In education, for example, the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan's cousin into what *Forbes'* Michael Noer called \"the largest school in the world,\" with technology poised to disrupt how people learn.[478] YouTube was awarded a 2008 George Foster Peabody Award,[479] the website being described as a Speakers' Corner that \"both embodies and promotes democracy.\"[480] *The Washington Post* reported that a disproportionate share of YouTube's most subscribed channels feature minorities, contrasting with mainstream television in which the stars are largely white.[481] A Pew Research Center study reported the development of \"visual journalism\", in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news organizations share in content creation.[482] The study also concluded that YouTube was becoming an important platform by which people acquire news.[483]\n\n\nYouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government, such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates (2007) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video, with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape.[484] Describing the Arab Spring (2010–2012), sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using \"Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world.\"[485] In 2012, more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the \"Kony 2012\" video was posted to YouTube, with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video \"will do more to lead to (Kony's) demise than all other action combined.\"[486]\n\n\n\n![](image)Leading YouTube content creators met at the White House with U.S. President Obama to discuss how government could better connect with the \"YouTube generation.\"[487][488]\nConversely, YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens, the White House's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012[489] and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)-compliant health insurance.[490] In February 2014, U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare[491] but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the \"YouTube Generation.\"[487] Whereas YouTube's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted, the YouTube content creators' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website's distracting content and fickle audience.[487]\n\n\nSome YouTube videos have themselves had a direct effect on world events, such as *Innocence of Muslims* (2012) which spurred protests and related anti-American violence internationally.[492] TED curator Chris Anderson described a phenomenon by which geographically distributed individuals in a certain field share their independently developed skills in YouTube videos, thus challenging others to improve their own skills, and spurring invention and evolution in that field.[477] Journalist Virginia Heffernan stated in *The New York Times* that such videos have \"surprising implications\" for the dissemination of culture and even the future of classical music.[493]\n\n\nA 2017 article in *The New York Times Magazine* posited that YouTube had become \"the new talk radio\" for the far right.[494] Almost a year before YouTube's January 2019 announcement that it would begin a \"gradual change\" of \"reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways\",[495] Zeynep Tufekci had written in *The New York Times* that, \"(g)iven its billion or so users, YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century\".[496] Under YouTube's changes to its recommendation engine, the most recommended channel evolved from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones (2016) to Fox News (2019).[497] According to a 2020 study, \"An emerging journalistic consensus theorizes the central role played by the video 'recommendation engine,' but we believe that this is premature. Instead, we propose the 'Supply and Demand' framework for analyzing politics on YouTube.\"[498] A 2022 study found that \"despite widespread concerns that YouTube's algorithms send people down 'rabbit holes' with recommendations to extremist videos, little systematic evidence exists to support this conjecture\", \"exposure to alternative and extremist channel videos on YouTube is heavily concentrated among a small group of people with high prior levels of gender and racial resentment.\", and \"contrary to the 'rabbit holes' narrative, non-subscribers are rarely recommended videos from alternative and extremist channels and seldom follow such recommendations when offered.\"[499]\n\n\n*The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers*[500] and the YouTube Symphony Orchestra[501] selected their membership based on individual video performances.[477][501] Further, the cybercollaboration charity video \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti (YouTube edition)\" was formed by mixing performances of 57 globally distributed singers into a single musical work,[502] with *The Tokyo Times* noting the \"We Pray for You\" YouTube cyber-collaboration video as an example of a trend to use crowdsourcing for charitable purposes.[503]\nThe anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens,[504] that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U.S. President Barack Obama, Vice President Biden, White House staff, and several cabinet secretaries.[505] Similarly, in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd's video \"My story: Struggling, bullying, suicide, self-harm,\" legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy.[506] In May 2018, after London Metropolitan Police claimed that drill music videos glamorizing violence gave rise to gang violence, YouTube deleted 30 videos.[507]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nPrior to 2020, Google did not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's revenues in 2007 were noted as \"not material\" in a regulatory filing.[508] In June 2008, a *Forbes* magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $200 million, noting progress in advertising sales.[509] In 2012, YouTube's revenue from its ads program was estimated at $3.7 billion.[510] In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit $5.6 billion according to eMarketer,[510][511] while others estimated $4.7 billion.[510] The vast majority of videos on YouTube are free to view and supported by advertising.[62] In May 2013, YouTube introduced a trial scheme of 53 subscription channels with prices ranging from $0.99 to $6.99 a month.[512] The move was seen as an attempt to compete with other providers of online subscription services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.[62]\n\n\nGoogle first published exact revenue numbers for YouTube in February 2020 as part of Alphabet's 2019 financial report. According to Google, YouTube had made US$15.1 billion in ad revenue in 2019, in contrast to US$8.1 billion in 2017 and US$11.1 billion in 2018. YouTube's revenues made up nearly 10% of the total Alphabet revenue in 2019.[513][514] These revenues accounted for approximately 20 million subscribers combined between YouTube Premium and YouTube Music subscriptions, and 2 million subscribers to YouTube TV.[515]\n\n\nYouTube had $19.8 billion in revenue in 2020.[516]\n\n\n\n### Partnership with corporations[edit]\n\n\nYouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006.[517] In March 2007, it struck a deal with BBC for three channels with BBC content, one for news and two for entertainment.[518] In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for U.S. viewers called \"Shows\". The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and Disney.[519][520] In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of \"Shows\" available to UK viewers, offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners.[521] In January 2010, YouTube introduced an online film rentals service,[522] which is only available to users in the United States, Canada, and the UK as of 2010.[523][524][*needs update*] The service offers over 6,000 films.[525]\n\n\n\n#### 2017 advertiser boycott[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube, after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremist content. The government demanded assurances that its advertising would \"be delivered safely and appropriately\". *The Guardian* newspaper, as well as other major British and U.S. brands, similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content. Google stated that it had \"begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear\".[526][527] In early April 2017, the YouTube channel h3h3Productions presented evidence claiming that a *Wall Street Journal* article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video, citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader. The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video.[528][529]\n\n\nOn April 6, 2017, YouTube announced that to \"ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules\", it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review, and have at least 10,000-lifetime views, before they may join the Partner Program.[530]\n\n\n\n### YouTuber earnings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Total annual earnings of the top ten YouTuber accounts, and the income of the single highest-earning account.\nIn May 2007, YouTube launched its Partner Program (YPP), a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site.[531] YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader.[532][533]\n\n\nThere are over two million members of the YouTube Partner Program.[534] According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually, no more than half of the eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, due to a lack of interested advertisers.[535]\n\n\nYouTube's policies restrict certain forms of content from being included in videos being monetized with advertising, including videos containing violence, strong language, sexual content, \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\" (unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\"),[536] and videos whose user comments contain \"inappropriate\" content.[537]\n\n\nIn 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos.[538][539] In April 2017, YouTube set an eligibility requirement of 10,000 lifetime views for a paid subscription.[540] On January 16, 2018, the eligibility requirement for monetization was changed to 4,000 hours of watch-time within the past 12 months and 1,000 subscribers.[540] The move was seen as an attempt to ensure that videos being monetized did not lead to controversy, but was criticized for penalizing smaller YouTube channels.[541]\n\n\nYouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, are a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels.[542] The trophies made of nickel plated copper-nickel alloy, golden plated brass, silver plated metal, ruby, and red tinted crystal glass are given to channels with at least one hundred thousand, a million, ten million, fifty million subscribers, and one hundred million subscribers, respectively.[543][544]\n\n\nYouTube's policies on \"advertiser-friendly content\" restrict what may be incorporated into videos being monetized; this includes strong violence, language,[545] sexual content, and \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\", unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\".[546] In September 2016, after introducing an enhanced notification system to inform users of these violations, YouTube's policies were criticized by prominent users, including Phillip DeFranco and Vlogbrothers. DeFranco argued that not being able to earn advertising revenue on such videos was \"censorship by a different name\". A YouTube spokesperson stated that while the policy itself was not new, the service had \"improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators\".[547][548][549] *Boing Boing* reported in 2019 that LGBT keywords resulted in demonetization.[550]\n\n\nAs of November 2020 in the United States and June 2021 worldwide,[551] YouTube reserves the right to monetize any video on the platform, even if their uploader is not a member of the YouTube Partner Program. This will occur on channels whose content is deemed \"advertiser-friendly\", and all revenue will go directly to Google without any share given to the uploader.[552]\n\n\n\n### Revenue to copyright holders[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: § Copyrighted material\n\nThe majority of YouTube's advertising revenue goes to the publishers and video producers who hold the rights to their videos; the company retains 45% of the ad revenue.[553] In 2010, it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders. YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue.[554] In May 2013, Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games.[555] In February 2015, Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators through the Nintendo Creators Program.[556][557][558] On March 20, 2019, Nintendo announced on Twitter that the company will end the Creators program. Operations for the program ceased on March 20, 2019.[559][560]\n\n\n\n## Censorship and bans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Censorship of YouTube\n\n![](image)Availability of YouTube as of January 2021:  \n Has local YouTube version\n Accessible (Worldwide version)\n Currently blocked\n Previously blocked\n\nYouTube has been censored, filtered, or banned for a variety of reasons, including:[561]\n\n\n\n* Limiting public access and exposure to content that may ignite social or political unrest.\n* Preventing criticism of a ruler (e.g. in North Korea), government (e.g. in China) or its actions (e.g. in Morocco), government officials (e.g. in Turkey and Libya), or religion (e.g. in Pakistan).\n* Morality-based laws, e.g. in Iran.\n\n\nAccess to specific videos is sometimes prevented due to copyright and intellectual property protection laws (e.g. in Germany), violations of hate speech, and preventing access to videos judged inappropriate for youth,[562] which is also done by YouTube with the YouTube Kids app and with \"restricted mode\".[563] Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to its bandwidth limitations[564][565] and the site's potential for distraction.[561][566]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], public access to YouTube is blocked in many countries, including China, North Korea, Iran, Turkmenistan,[567] Uzbekistan,[568][569] Tajikistan, Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan. In some countries, YouTube is blocked for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service.[561]\n\n\nReports emerged that since October 2019, comments posted with Chinese characters insulting the Chinese Communist Party (共匪 or \"communist bandit\") or (五毛 or \"50 Cent Party\", referring to state-sponsored commentators) were being automatically deleted within 15 seconds.[570]\n\n\nSpecific incidents where YouTube has been blocked include:\n\n\n\n* Thailand blocked access in April 2007 over a video said to be insulting the Thai king.[571]\n* Morocco blocked access in May 2007, possibly as a result of videos critical of Morocco's occupation of Western Sahara.[572] YouTube became accessible again on May 30, 2007, after *Maroc Telecom* unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was a mere \"technical glitch\".[573]\n* Turkey blocked access between 2008 and 2010 after controversy over videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.[574][575][576] In November 2010, a video of the Turkish politician Deniz Baykal caused the site to be blocked again briefly, and the site was threatened with a new shutdown if it did not remove the video.[577] During the two and a half-year block of YouTube, the video-sharing website remained the eighth-most-accessed site in Turkey.[578][579] In 2014, Turkey blocked the access for the second time, after \"a high-level intelligence leak.\"[580][581][582]\n* Pakistan blocked access on February 23, 2008, because of \"offensive material\" towards the Islamic faith, including display of the Danish cartoons of Muhammad.[583] This led to a near global blackout of the YouTube site for around two hours, as the Pakistani block was inadvertently transferred to other countries. On February 26, 2008, the ban was lifted after the website had removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government.[584][585] Many Pakistanis circumvented the three-day block by using virtual private network software.[586] In May 2010, following the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day, Pakistan again blocked access to YouTube, citing \"growing sacrilegious content\".[587] The ban was lifted on May 27, 2010, after the website removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government. However, individual videos deemed offensive to Muslims posted on YouTube will continue to be blocked.[588][589] Pakistan again placed a ban on YouTube in September 2012, after the site refused to remove the film *Innocence of Muslims*. The ban was lifted in January 2016 after YouTube launched a Pakistan-specific version.[590]\n* Libya blocked access on January 24, 2010, because of videos that featured demonstrations in the city of Benghazi by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at parties. The blocking was criticized by Human Rights Watch.[591] In November 2011, after the Libyan Civil War, YouTube was once again allowed in Libya.[592]\n* Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sudan blocked access in September 2012 following controversy over a 14-minute trailer for the film *Innocence of Muslims* which had been posted on the site.[593][594][595][596][597] A court in the southern Russian Republic of Chechnya ruled that *Innocence of Muslims* should be banned.[598] In Libya and Egypt, it was blamed for violent protests. YouTube stated: \"This video—which is widely available on the Web—is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube. However, given the very difficult situation in Libya and Egypt we have temporarily restricted access in both countries.\"[599][600]\n* Russia threatened to ban YouTube after the platform deleted two German RT channels in September 2021.[601] Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, YouTube announced on March 1 the immediate removal of RT (and other Russian-government funded outlets) from its platform in Europe.[602]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* Invidious, a free and open-source alternative frontend to YouTube\n* Alternative media\n* BookTube\n* BreadTube\n* CNN/YouTube presidential debates\n* Lists\n\t+ Comparison of video hosting services\n\t+ List of Google Easter eggs#YouTube\n\t+ List of Internet phenomena\n\t+ List of most-disliked YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-liked YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-viewed YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n\t+ List of online video platforms\n\t+ List of YouTubers\n* Lawsuits\n\t+ *Viacom International Inc. v.
