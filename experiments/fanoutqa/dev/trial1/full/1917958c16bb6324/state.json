The Yellow River's basin is often regarded as the birthplace of ancient Chinese civilization.[5][6]\n\n\nThe yellow sediments were carried downstream from the Loess Plateau.[7] There are frequent devastating floods and course changes produced by the continual elevation of the river bed, sometimes above the level of its surrounding farm fields.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe Yellow River (\u9ec3\u6cb3, *Hu\u00e1ng H\u00e9*, Beijing Mandarin: [xu\u032f\u0251\u014b\u02e7\u02e5 x\u0264\u02e7\u02e5] \u24d8) was not always yellow. When the river was still clear, it was simply referred to as \"the River\" (\u6cb3, Old Chinese: \\*g\u00e2i).[8] Observations made at Yumenkou indicated the river changed from clear to muddy sometime between 367 BC and AD 165, according to chronicles\u2019 records.[9] Alternative names \"Murky River\" (\u6fc1\u6cb3, Old Chinese: \\*dr\u00f4k-g\u00e2i)[8] and \"Yellow River\" (\u9ec3\u6cb3, Old Chinese: \\*gw\u00e2\u014b-g\u00e2i)[8] were attested in 145 BC[10][11] and in AD 429 respectively.[a] The name Yellow River edges out Murky River by the end of Tang dynasty, for unclear reasons.[b]\n\n\nIn the Shaanxi loess plateau, it is referred to as \"River, my lord/master\" in Jin Chinese language (\u8001\u723a\u6cb3, [lo\u02e6\u02e9\u02e8 i\u02e7 x\u0264u\u032f\u02e7]).[18][19]\n\n\nIn Mongolian, it is called *\u0160ar M\u00f6r\u00f6n* (\u0428\u0430\u0440 \u043c\u04e9\u0440\u04e9\u043d, \"Yellow River\")[20] or *Khatan Gol* (\u0425\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043d \u0433\u043e\u043b, \"Queen River\").\"[21] The river is mentioned in the Kul Tigin stele as the \"Green River\" (Old Turkic\u00a0: *ya\u0161\u00efl \u00fcg\u00fcz*, \ud803\udc16\ud803\udc41\ud803\udc1e\ud803\udc3d\ud803\udc3a\ud803\udc0d).[22]\n\n\nThe Tibetan name is \"River of the Peacock\" (Tibetan: \u0f62\u0fa8\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f74, Wylie: *rma.chu*, THL: *Ma Chu*; simplified Chinese: \u739b\u66f2; traditional Chinese: \u746a\u66f2; pinyin: *M\u01ce Q\u01d4*).\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of natural disasters by death toll\n\n### Yellow River Civilization[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yellow River civilization\n\n### Dynamics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*The Yellow River Breaches its Course* by Ma Yuan (1160\u20131225, Song dynasty). Flooding of the river has been the cause of millions of deaths.\nSee also: Yellow River floods\n\nThe Yellow River first formed between 56 million and 34 million years ago during the Eocene epoch,[7] while the familiar shape appeared around 7 thousand years ago.[7]\n\n\nThe river has long been critical to the development of northern China, and is regarded by scholars as one cradle of civilization. Flooding of the river has also caused much destruction, including multiple floods that have resulted in the deaths of over one million people. Among the deadliest were the 1332\u201333 flood during the Yuan dynasty, the 1887 flood during the Qing dynasty which killed anywhere from 900,000 to 2 million people, and a Republic of China era 1931 flood (part of a massive number of floods that year) that killed 1\u20134 million people.[23]\n\n\nThe cause of the floods is the large amount of fine-grained loess carried by the river from the Loess Plateau, which is continuously deposited along the bottom of its channel. The sedimentation causes natural dams to slowly accumulate. These subaqueous dams are unpredictable and generally undetectable. Eventually, the enormous amount of water needs to find a new way to the sea, forcing it to take the path of least resistance. When this happens, it bursts out across the flat North China Plain, sometimes taking a new channel and inundating most farmland, cities or towns in its path.\n\n\nThe traditional Chinese response of building higher and higher levees along the banks sometimes also contributed to the severity of the floods: When flood water did break through the levees, it could no longer drain back into the river bed as it would after a normal flood, as the river bed was sometimes now higher than the surrounding countryside. These changes could cause the river's mouth to shift as much as 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi), sometimes reaching the ocean to the north of Shandong Peninsula and sometimes to the south.[24]\n\n\nAnother historical source of devastating floods is the collapse of upstream ice dams in Inner Mongolia with an accompanying sudden release of vast quantities of impounded water. There have been 11 such major floods in the past century, each causing tremendous loss of life and property. Nowadays, explosives dropped from aircraft are used to break the ice dams before they become dangerous.[25]\n\n\nBefore modern dams appeared in China, the Yellow River used to be extremely prone to flooding. In the 2,540 years from 595 BC to 1946 AD, the Yellow River has been reckoned to have flooded 1,593 times, shifting its course 26 times noticeably and nine times severely.[26] These floods include some of the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded. Before modern disaster management, when floods occurred, some of the population might initially die from drowning and many more would suffer later from the ensuing famine and spread of diseases.[27]\n\n\n\n### Ancient times[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Yellow River as depicted in a Qing dynasty illustrated map (sections)\n![](image)Historical courses of the Yellow River\n![](image)Historical courses of the Yellow River\nIn Chinese mythology, the giant Kua Fu drained the Yellow River and the Wei River to quench his burning thirst as he pursued the Sun.[28] Historical documents from the Spring and Autumn period[29] and Qin dynasty[30] indicate that the Yellow River at that time flowed considerably north of its present course. These accounts show that after the river passed Luoyang, it flowed along the border between Shanxi and Henan Provinces, then continued along the border between Hebei and Shandong before emptying into Bohai Bay near present-day Tianjin. Another outlet followed essentially the present course.[26]\n\n\nThe river left these paths in 602 BC and shifted several hundred kilometers to the east.[29][31] Sabotage of dikes, canals, and reservoirs and deliberate flooding of rival states became a standard military tactic during the Warring States period.[32] As the Yellow River valley was the major entryway to the Guanzhong area and the state of Qin from the North China Plain, Qin heavily fortified the Hangu Pass; it saw numerous battles and was also an important chokepoint protecting the Han capitals of Chang'an and Luoyang. Major flooding in AD 11 is credited with the downfall of the short-lived Xin dynasty, and another flood in AD 70 returned the river north of Shandong on essentially its present course.[26]\n\n\n\n### Imperial times[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Yellow River and Huai surrounding Sizhou and the Ming Zuling in the *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries* edition of Pan Jixun's *Overview of River Maintenance*. By the time of the Qing-era edition, both had been entirely lost during the 1680 flood.\nFrom around the beginning of the 3rd century, the importance of the Hangu Pass was reduced, with the major fortifications and military bases moved upriver to Tongguan. In AD 923, the desperate Later Liang general Duan Ning again broke the dikes, flooding 1,000 square miles (2,600\u00a0km2) in a failed attempt to protect his realm's capital from the Later Tang. A similar proposal from the Song engineer Li Chun concerning flooding the lower reaches of the river to protect the central plains from the Khitai was overruled in 1020: the Chanyuan Treaty between the two states had expressly forbidden the Song from establishing new moats or changing river courses.[33]\n\n\nBreaches occurred regardless: one at Henglong in 1034 divided the course in three and repeatedly flooded the northern regions of Dezhou and Bozhou.[33] The Song worked for five years futilely attempting to restore the previous course\u00a0\u2013 using over 35,000 employees, 100,000 conscripts, and 220,000 tons of wood and bamboo in a single year[33]\u00a0\u2013 before abandoning the project in 1041. The more sluggish river then occasioned a breach at Shanghu that sent the main outlet north towards Tianjin in 1048[26]\n\n\nIn 1128, Song troops under the Kaifeng governor Du Chong (\u675c\u5145, *D\u00f9 Ch\u014dng*, d.\u00a01141) breached the southern dikes of the Yellow River in an effort to stop the advancing Jin army. The resulting major river avulsion allowed the Yellow to capture the Si and other tributaries of the Huai River.[34] For the first time in recorded history, the Yellow River shifted completely south of Shandong Peninsula and flowed into the Yellow Sea. By 1194, the mouth of the Huai had been blocked.[35] The buildup of silt deposits was such that even after the Yellow River later shifted its course, the Huai could no longer flow along its historic course, but instead, its water pools into Hongze Lake and then runs southward toward the Yangtze River.[36]\n\n\nA flood in 1344 returned the Yellow River south of Shandong. The Yuan dynasty was waning, and the emperor forced enormous teams to build new embankments for the river. The terrible conditions helped to fuel rebellions that led to the founding of the Ming dynasty.[24] The course changed again in 1391 when the river flooded from Kaifeng to Fengyang in Anhui. It was finally stabilized by the eunuch Li Xing during the public works projects following the 1494 flood.[37] The river flooded many times in the 16th century, including in 1526, 1534, 1558, and 1587. Each flood affected the river's lower course.[37]\n\n\nThe 1642 flood was man-made, caused by the attempt of the Ming governor of Kaifeng to use the river to destroy the peasant rebels under Li Zicheng who had been besieging the city for the past six months.[38] He directed his men to break the dikes in an attempt to flood the rebels, but destroyed his own city instead: the flood and the ensuing famine and plague are estimated to have killed 300,000 of the city's previous population of 378,000.[39] The once-prosperous city was nearly abandoned until its rebuilding under the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing dynasty.\n\n\nThe question of how aggressively flooding should be controlled, and whether it should be steered back to its original channels when it migrated, was a topic of controversy in the imperial court. Rival cliques made arguments based on budgetary, technical and strategic criteria. Geographer Charles Greer identifies two competing schools of thought on how to control the Yellow River. One, which he identifies as Confucian, advocated containing the river between higher levees, thus maximizing the amount of river basin land that could be cultivated. The other, which he associates with Taoism, favored lower levees separated by as much as 5-10 kilometers.[40] In one particular long-running debate during the 11th century reigns of the Renzong and Shenzong emperors, when the river repeatedly broke its levees and migrated north and west, officials battled over whether expensive measures should be taken to return the river to its former channels. The Shenzong emperor ultimately decreed that the river be allowed to remain in its new course.[41]\n\n\nTraditional flood control techniques made use of levees, revetments to absorb the energy of the water, overflow basins, drainage canals and polders.[42] Treatises on traditional flood control techniques were written by officials such as Pan Jixun,[43] who argued that joining branches of the river increased the water's power and this in turn increased its ability to flush sediment.[44] The difficult situation around the confluence of the Yellow River, the Huai, and the Grand Canal, however, still led to a major flood of the regional center Sizhou and Pan's dismissal from court. Subsequently, the river's 1680 flood entirely submerged Sizhou and the nearby Ming Zuling tombs beneath Hongze Lake for centuries until modern irrigation and flood control lowered the water level enough to permit their excavation and the tombs' restoration.\n\n\n\n### Recent times[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chinese Nationalist Army soldiers during the 1938 Yellow River flood.\nBetween 1851 and 1855,[26][35][37] the Yellow River returned to the north amid the floods that provoked the Nien and Taiping Rebellions. The 1887 flood has been estimated to have killed between 900,000 and 2 million people,[45] and is the second-worst natural disaster in history (excluding famines and epidemics). The Yellow River more or less adopted its present course during the 1897 flood.[35][46]\n\n\nThe 1931 flood killed an estimated 1,000,000 to 4,000,000,[45] and is the worst natural disaster recorded (excluding famines and epidemics).\n\n\nOn 9 June 1938, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Nationalist troops under Chiang Kai-shek broke the levees holding back the river near the village of Huayuankou in Henan, causing what has been called by Canadian historian, Diana Lary, a \"war-induced natural disaster\". The goal of the operation was to stop the advancing Japanese troops by following a strategy of \"using water as a substitute for soldiers\" (\u4ee5\u6c34\u4ee3\u5175 *yishui daibing*). The 1938 flood of an area covering 54,000\u00a0km2 (20,800\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) took some 500,000 to 900,000 Chinese lives, along with an unknown number of Japanese soldiers. The flood prevented the Japanese Army from taking Zhengzhou, on the southern bank of the Yellow River, but did not stop them from reaching their goal of capturing Wuhan, which was the temporary seat of the Chinese government and straddles the Yangtze River.[47]\n\n\nIn 1954, the People's Republic of China announced its General Plan to Fundamentally Control Yellow River Flood Disasters and Develop Yellow River Waterworks.[48]:\u200a111\u2013113 It sought to address both flooding risks and to convert rainfall-fed fields of the North China Plain to irrigated agriculture.[48]:\u200a114 Construction began in earnest in 1957.[48]:\u200a114\n\n\nFrom the 1970s to the 1990s, the dry-up trends accelerated, with the Yellow River failing to reach its mouth for an average of approximately 180 days per year in the 1990s.[48]:\u200a168 In 1997, the Yellow River did not reach the sea for 226 consecutive days.[48]:\u200a168\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Its total drainage area is about 795,000 square kilometers (307,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\n\n\nAccording to the China Exploration and Research Society,[49] the source of the Yellow River is at 34\u00b029\u203231\u2033N 96\u00b020\u203225\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff34.49194\u00b0N 96.34028\u00b0E\ufeff / 34.49194; 96.34028 in the Bayan Har Mountains near the eastern edge of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The source tributaries drain into Gyaring Lake and Ngoring Lake on the western edge of Golog Prefecture high in the Bayan Har Mountains of Qinghai. In the Zoige Basin along the boundary with Gansu, the Yellow River loops northwest and then northeast before turning south, creating the \"Ordos Loop\", and then flows generally eastward across the North China Plain to the Gulf of Bohai, draining a basin of 752,443 square kilometers (290,520\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) which nourishes 140 million people with drinking water and irrigation.[50]\n\n\nThe Yellow River passes through seven present-day provinces and two autonomous regions, namely (from west to east) Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong. Major cities along the present course of the Yellow River include (from west to east) Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Wuhai, Baotou, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Jinan. The current mouth of the Yellow River is located at Kenli County, Shandong.\n\n\nThe river is commonly divided into three stages. These are roughly the northeast of the mountainous Tibetan Plateau, the Ordos Loop and Loess Plateau, and the North China Plain.[51] However, different scholars have different opinions on how the three stages are divided.[*citation needed*] This article mainly adopts the division used by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission.[52]\n\n\nThe Yellow River derived sediments have been transported out of the Bohai Sea, all way to the North Yellow Sea and South Yellow Sea, and formed a Distal Depocenter around the Shandong Peninsula.[53]\n\n\n\n### Upper reaches[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

This segment has a total length of 3,472 kilometers (2,157\u00a0mi) and total basin area of 386,000 square kilometers (149,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), 51.4% of the total basin area. Along this length, the elevation of the Yellow River drops 3,496 meters (11,470\u00a0ft), with an average grade of 0.10%.\n\n\nThe source section flows mainly through pastures, swamps, and knolls between the Bayan Har Mountains, and the Anemaqen (Amne Machin) Mountains in Qinghai. The river water is clear and flows steadily. Crystal clear lakes are characteristic of this section. The two main lakes along this section are Lake Gyaring (Zhaling) and Lake Ngoring (Eling), with capacities of 4.7\u00a0billion and 10.8\u00a0billion m3 (166 and 381 billion ft3), respectively. At elevations over 4,290\u00a0m (14,070\u00a0ft) above sea level they are the two largest plateau freshwater lakes nationwide. A significant amount of land in the Yellow River's source area has been designated as the Sanjiangyuan (\"'Three Rivers' Sources\") National Nature Reserve, to protect the source region of the Yellow River, the Yangtze, and the Mekong.\n\n\nFlowing east at the eastern edge of the Amne Machin Mountains, the Yellow River enters Maqu County in Gansu. Here, the river skirts through the high-altitude peat bog known as the Zoig\u00ea Wetlands and makes a sharp turn towards the northwest forming the border between Maqu and Zoig\u00ea County in Sichuan. Flowing now along the northern edge of Amne Machin, the river reenters Qinghai and gradually curves north towards the Longyang Gorge at Xinghai.\n\n\nThe valley section stretches from Longyang Gorge in Qinghai to Qingtong Gorge in Gansu. Steep cliffs line both sides of the river. The water bed is narrow and the average drop is large, so the flow in this section is extremely turbulent and fast. There are 20 gorges in this section, the most famous of these being the Longyang, Jishi, Liujia, Bapan, and Qingtong gorges. The flow conditions in this section makes it the best location for hydroelectric plants. The Yellow River exits Qinghai for the second and final time in these gorges and enters Gansu for the second time just before Liujia Gorge. Downstream from the Yanguo Gorge, the provincial capital of Lanzhou is built upon the Yellow River's banks. The Yellow River flows northeasterly out of Gansu and into Ningxia before the Qingtong Gorge.\n\n\nAfter emerging from the Qingtong Gorge, the river comes into a section of vast alluvial plains, the Yinchuan Plain and Hetao Plain. In this section, the regions along the river are mostly deserts and grasslands, with very few tributaries. The flow is slow. The Hetao Plain has a length of 900\u00a0km (560\u00a0mi) and width of 30 to 50\u00a0km (19 to 31\u00a0mi). It is historically the most important irrigation plain along the Yellow River.\n\n\n\n### Middle reaches[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ordos Loop and Hetao\n\n![](image)At Lanzhou, Gansu\n![](image)At Shapotou, Ningxia\n![](image)Qiankun bend in Yonghe County\n![](image)At Luoyang, Henan\nThe Ordos Loop formed by an enormous twist of the Yellow River, beginning at Zhongning County in Ningxia and ending with a drastic eastward turn at its confluence with the Wei at Tongguan in Shaanxi. However, the official division for the middle reaches of the river run from Hekou in Togtoh County, Inner Mongolia, to Zhengzhou, Henan. The middle reaches are 1,206\u00a0km (749\u00a0mi) long, with a basin area of 344,000 square kilometers (133,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), 45.7% of the total, with a total elevation drop of 890\u00a0m (2,920\u00a0ft), an average drop of 0.074%. There are 30 large tributaries along the middle reaches, and the water flow is increased by 43.5% on this stage. The middle reaches contribute 92% of the river's silts.\n\n\nThe middle stream of the Yellow River passes through the Loess Plateau, where substantial erosion takes place. The large amount of mud and sand discharged into the river makes the Yellow River the most sediment-laden river in the world. The highest recorded annual level of silts discharged into the Yellow River is 3.91\u00a0billion tons in 1933. The highest silt concentration level was recorded in 1977 at 920\u00a0kg/m3 (57.4\u00a0lb/ft3). These sediments later deposit in the slower lower reaches of the river, elevating the river bed and creating the famous \"river above ground\". From Hekou to Yumenkou, the river passes through the longest series of continuous valleys on its main course, collectively called the Jinshan Valley. The abundant hydrodynamic resources stored in this section make it the second most suitable area to build hydroelectric power plants. The famous Hukou Waterfall is in the lower part of this valley on the border of Shanxi and Shaanxi.\n\n\n\n### Lower reaches[edit]\n\n\nIn the lower reaches, from Zhengzhou, Henan to its mouth, a distance of 786\u00a0km (488\u00a0mi), the river is confined to a levee-lined course as it flows to the northeast across the North China Plain before emptying into the Bohai Sea. The basin area in this stage is only 23,000 square kilometers (8,900\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), a mere 3% of the total, because few tributaries add to the flow in this stage; nearly all rivers to the south drain into the Huai River, whereas those to the north drain into the Hai River. The Huai River Basin, for example, is separated from the Yellow River Basin by the south dike of the Yellow River.[54] The total drop in elevation of the lower reaches is 93.6\u00a0m (307\u00a0ft), with an average grade of 0.012%.\n\n\nThe silts received from the middle reaches form sediments here, elevating the river bed. Excessive sediment deposits have raised the riverbed several meters above the surrounding ground. That is why this part of the river is called the 'Earth Suspended River'. At Kaifeng, Henan, the Yellow River is 10 meters (33\u00a0ft) above the ground level.[55]\n\n\n\n### Tributaries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The mouth of the Daxia River (coming from bottom right), flowing into the Yellow River's Liujiaxia Reservoir in Linxia Prefecture, Gansu\nTributaries of the Yellow River listed from its source to its mouth include:\n\n\n\n* White River\n* Daxia River\n* Tao River\n* Huang Shui\n\t+ Datong River\n* Zhuanglang River\n* Zuli River\n* Qingshui River\n* Dahei River\n* Kuye River\n* Wuding River\n* Fen River\n* Wei River (the Wei River is the largest of these tributaries)\n* Luo River\n* Qin River\n* Dawen River\n\n\nThe lower reaches of the Yellow River have no tributaries.[48]:\u200a168\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

If it is running to the sea with sufficient volume, 1.4 billion tons are carried to the sea per year.[*citation needed*] One estimate gives 34 kilograms of silt per cubic meter as opposed to 10 for the Colorado and 1 for the Nile.[26]\n\n\nIts average discharge is said to be 2,110 cubic meters per second (32,000 for the Yangtze), with a maximum of 25,000 and minimum of 245. However, since 1972, it often runs dry before it reaches the sea. The low volume is due to increased agricultural irrigation, increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river as of 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated 74,000\u00a0km2 (48,572\u00a0mi2) of land.[50] The Yellow River delta totals 8,000 square kilometers (3,090\u00a0mi2). However, with the decrease in silt reaching the sea, it has been reported to be shrinking slightly each year since 1996 through erosion.[56]\n\n\nThe highest volume occurs during the rainy season from July to October, when 60% of the annual volume of the river flows. Maximum demand for irrigation is needed between March and June. In order to capture excess water for use when needed and for flood control and electricity generation, several dams have been built, but their expected life is limited due to the high silt load. A proposed South\u2013North Water Transfer Project involves several schemes to divert water from the Yangtze River: one in the western headwaters of the rivers where they are closest to one another, another from the upper reaches of the Han River, and a third using the route of the old Grand Canal.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDue to its heavy load of silt the Yellow River is a depositing stream\u00a0\u2013 that is, it deposits part of its carried burden of soil in its bed in stretches where it is flowing slowly. These deposits elevate the riverbed which flows between natural levees in its lower reaches. Should a flood occur, the river may break out of the levees into the surrounding lower flood plain and take\na new channel. Historically this has occurred about once every hundred years. In modern times, considerable effort has been made to strengthen levees and control floods.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Hydroelectric power dams[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Liujiaxia Dam, Gansu\n![](image)Sanmenxia Dam, Henan\nBelow is the list of hydroelectric power stations built on the Yellow River, arranged according to the first year of operation (in brackets):\n\n\n\n* Sanmenxia Dam (1960; Sanmenxia, Henan)\n* Sanshenggong Dam (1966)\n* Qingtong Gorge hydroelectric power station (1968; Qingtongxia, Ningxia)\n* Liujiaxia Dam (Liujia Gorge) (1974; Yongjing County, Gansu)\n* Lijiaxia Dam (1997) (Jainca County, Qinghai)\n* Yanguoxia Dam (Yanguo Gorge) hydroelectric power station (1975; Yongjing County, Gansu)\n* Tianqiao Dam (1977)\n* Bapanxia Dam (Bapan Gorge) (1980; Xigu District, Lanzhou, Gansu)\n* Longyangxia Dam (1992; Gonghe County, Qinghai)\n* Da Gorge hydroelectric power station (1998)\n* Li Gorge hydroelectric power station (1999)\n* Wanjiazhai Dam (1999; Pianguan County, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia)\n* Xiaolangdi Dam (2001) (Jiyuan, Henan)\n* Laxiwa Dam (2010) (Guide County, Qinghai)\n* Yangqu Dam (2016) (Xinghai County, Qinghai)\n* Maerdang Dam (2018) (Maq\u00ean County, Qinghai)\n\n\nAs reported in 2000, the 7 largest hydro power plants (Longyangxia, Lijiaxia, Liujiaxia, Yanguoxia, Bapanxia, Daxia and Qinglongxia) had the total installed capacity of 5,618 MW.[57]\n\n\n\n## Crossings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Major cities along the Yellow River\n![](image)Pontoon bridge (Luokou Pontoon Bridge simplified Chinese: \u6d1b\u53e3\u6d6e\u6865; traditional Chinese: \u6d1b\u53e3\u6d6e\u6a4b; pinyin: *Lu\u00f2k\u01d2u F\u00faqi\u00e1o*) over the Yellow River in Jinan, Shandong\nThe main bridges and ferries by the province names in the order of downstream to upstream are:[*citation needed*]\n\n\nShandong\n\n\n\n* Dongying Yellow River Bridge\n* Shengli Yellow River Bridge (Dongying)\n* Lijin Yellow River Bridge (Dongying)\n* Binzhou Yellow River Road-Railway Bridge\n* Binzhou Yellow River Highway Bridge\n* Binzhou\u2013Laiwu Expressway Binzhou Yellow River Bridge (Binzhou\u2013Zibo)\n* Huiqing Yellow River Bridge (Binzhou\u2013Zibo)\n* Jiyang Yellow River Bridge (Jinan)\n* G20 Qingdao\u2013Yinchuan Expressway Jinan Yellow River Bridge (Jinan)\n* Jinan Yellow River Bridge\n* Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge (Jinan)\n* Jinan Jianbang Yellow River Bridge\n* Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-speed Railway Jinan Yellow River Bridge (Jinan\u2013Dezhou)\n* Beijing\u2013Taipei Expressway Jinan Yellow River Bridge (Jinan\u2013Dezhou)\n* Beijing\u2013Shanghai Railway Jinan Yellow River New Bridge (Jinan\u2013Dezhou)\n* Pingyin Yellow River Bridge (Jinan-Liaocheng)\n\n\nShandong\u2013Henan\n\n\n\n* Beijing\u2013Kowloon Railway Sunkou Yellow River Bridge (Jining\u2013Puyang)\n* Juancheng Yellow River Highway Bridge (Heze\u2013Puyang)\n* Dongming Yellow River Highway Bridge (Heze\u2013Puyang)\n\n\nHenan\n\n\n\n* Kaifeng Yellow River Bridge (Kaifeng)\n* Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge (Zhengzhou)\n\n\nShanxi\u2013Henan\n\n\n\n* Sanmen Yellow River Bridge (Sanmenxia)\n\n\nShaanxi\u2013Henan\n\n\n\n* Hancheng Yumenkou Yellow River Bridge\n\n\nNingxia\n\n\n\n* Yinchuan Yellow River Bridge (Yinchuan)\n\n\nInner Mongolia\n\n\n\n* Baotou Yellow River Bridge (Baotou)\n\n\nGansu\n\n\n\n* Lanzhou Yellow River Bridge\n* Zhongshan Bridge (Lanzhou)\n\n\nQinghai\n\n\n\n* Dari Yellow River Bridge\n\n\n## Fauna[edit]\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The paradise fish is well known in the aquarium hobby and it originates from East Asian river basins, including the Yellow River\nThe Yellow River basin is rich in fish, being the home of more than 160 native species in 92 genera and 28 families, including 19 species found nowhere else in the world (endemic).[58][51] However, due to habitat loss, pollution, introduced species and overfishing many of the natives have declined or disappeared entirely; several are recognized as threatened on China's Red List.[58][59] Dams and their reservoirs have increased the habitat for species of slow-moving and static waters, while it excluded species of flowing waters and prevented the up- and down-stream breeding migration of others.[58][59] In the 2000s, only 80 native fish in 63 genera and 18 families were recorded in the Yellow River basin.[58] In contrast, introduced fish have risen in both abundance and number of species; only one introduced fish species was recorded in the 1960s when ichthyologist Li Sizhong published his original survey of fish fauna of the region, but by the 2000s there were 26.[58]\n\n\nAs typical of Asian rivers, Cyprinidae is by far the most diverse family in the Yellow River basin. More than 85 cyprinids have been recorded in this basin, including species that still are present and species that no longer are present. Other highly diverse families are the stone loaches (more than 20 species), gobies (c. 15 species), true loaches (c. 10 species) and bagrid catfish (c. 10 species).[58] Although there are species found throughout much of the river, several have a more restricted range. For example, the uppermost, highest parts on the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau has relatively few native species, notably snowtrout and allies (*Gymnocypris*, *Gymnodiptychus*, *Platypharodon* and *Schizopygopsis*), and *Triplophysa* loaches.[60] Of the 18 endemics in the Yellow River basin, 12 are (or were) found in the upper part.[58] These in particular have become threatened and the fish fauna in many headwaters are now dominated by introduced salmonids.[58][60] In contrast, the lowermost part of the river and its delta are home to many brackish water or euryhaline species, like gobies (although there are also true freshwater gobies in the Yellow River), Asian seabasses, flatfish and *Takifugu* pufferfish.[58]\n\n\nFishing remains an important activity, but catches have declined. In 2007, it was noted that 40% fewer fish were caught in the Yellow River compared to earlier catches.[59] Large cyprinids (Asian carp, predatory carp, Wuchang bream and Mongolian redfin) and large catfish (Amur and Lanzhou catfish) are still present, but the largest species, the Chinese paddlefish, kaluga sturgeon and Yangtze sturgeon, have not been reported from the Yellow River basin in about 50 years.[58][51][61] Other species that support important fisheries include white Amur bream, ayu, mandarin fish, *Protosalanx* icefish, northern snakehead, Asian swamp eel and others.[58]\n\n\nAnnual fishing ban has been implemented since 2018, covering the entire Yellow River basin from 1 April to 30 June each year.[62] A total ban of fishing of natural fishes is being implemented in the upper reaches of the Yellow River starting 1 April 2022, covering Qinghai, Sichuan and Gansu provinces, until the end of 2025. For the rest of the basin, the annual ban is extended to a period from 1 April to 31 July.[63]\n\n\n\n### Aquaculture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Chinese pond turtle (shown) and Chinese softshell turtle are both native to the Yellow River, but also farmed in large numbers\nThe Yellow River is generally less suitable for aquaculture than the rivers of central and southern China, such as the Yangtze or the Pearl River, but aquaculture is also practiced in some areas along the Yellow River. An important aquaculture area is the riverside plain in Xingyang City, upstream from Zhengzhou. Since the development of fish ponds started in Xingyang's riverside Wangcun Town in 1986, the pond systems in Wangcun have grown to the total size of 15,000 *mu* (10\u00a0km2), making the town the largest aquaculture center in North China.[64]\n\n\nTwo turtle species are native to the Yellow River basin: the Chinese pond turtle and Chinese softshell turtle.[65] Both species\u2014but especially the softshell\u2014are widely farmed for food.[66] A variety of the Chinese softshell turtle popular in Chinese gourmets is called the Yellow River turtle (\u9ec4\u6cb3\u9cd6). Nowadays most of the Yellow River turtles eaten in China's restaurants comes from turtle farms, which may or may not be near the Yellow River.\nIn 2007, construction started in Wangcun, Henan on a large farm for raising this turtle variety. With the capacity for raising 5 million turtles a year, the facility was expected to become Henan's largest farm of this kind.[67]\n\n\nThe huge, entirely aquatic Chinese giant salamander, a species that has declined drastically due primarily to persecution for food and traditional medicine, is native to the Yellow River and other Chinese rivers. It is farmed in large numbers in several parts of China and genetic studies have revealed that the captive stock mostly is of Yellow River origin. As these often are released back into the wild, the Yellow River type of the Chinese giant salamander has spread to other parts of China, which represents a problem to the other types.[68]\n\n\n\n## Pollution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Water pollution in China\n\nOn 25 November 2008, Tania Branigan of *The Guardian* filed a report \"China's Mother River: the Yellow River\", claiming that severe pollution has made one-third of China's Yellow River unusable even for agricultural or industrial use, due to factory discharges and sewage from fast-expanding cities.[69] After reaching the first major city, Xining, the river is heavily polluted.[70] The Yellow River Conservancy Commission had surveyed more than 8,384\u00a0mi (13,493\u00a0km) of the river in 2007 and said 33.8% of the river system registered worse than \"level five\" according to the criteria used by the UN Environment Program.[*dubious \u2013 discuss*] Level five is unfit for drinking, aquaculture, industrial use, or even agriculture. The report said waste and sewage discharged into the system last year totaled 4.29b tons. Industry and manufacturing made up 70% of the discharge into the river with households accounting for 23% and just over 6% coming from other sources.[*which?*]\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Qikou town along Yellow River in Shanxi Province\nIn ancient times, it was believed that the Yellow River flowed from Heaven as a continuation of the Milky Way. In a Chinese legend, Zhang Qian is said to have been commissioned to find the source of the Yellow River. After sailing up-river for many days, he saw a girl spinning and a cow herd. Upon asking the girl where he was, she presented him with her shuttle with instructions to show it to the astrologer Yan Junping (\u56b4\u541b\u5e73). When he returned, the astrologer recognized it as the shuttle of the Weaving Girl (Vega), and, moreover, said that at the time Zhang received the shuttle, he had seen a wandering star interpose itself between the Weaving Girl and the cow herd (Altair).[71]\n\n\nThe provinces of Hebei and Henan derive their names from the Yellow River. Their names mean, respectively, \"North of the River\" and \"South of the River\", although the border between them historically has never been stable, and currently the border between Hebei and Henan is not the Yellow River, but the Zhang River instead.\n\n\n\nMother river, China's Sorrow, and cradle of Chinese civilization.\nTraditionally, it is believed that the Chinese civilization originated in the Yellow River basin. The Chinese refer to the river as \"the Mother River\" and \"the cradle of the Chinese civilization\".\nDuring the long history of China, the Yellow River has been considered a blessing as well as a curse and has been nicknamed both \"China's Pride\" and \"China's Sorrow\".[72]\n\n\n\nRiver of disaster\nDespite Yellow River having a central role in the development of Chinese civilization on North China Plain, flooding and constant rerouting of the river have also caused many great disaster to population along the river for long, hence it is also known as a River of disaster (Chinese: \u707e\u96be\u6cb3), with the disaster brought by the River said as history of disaster in the development of Chinese civilization, and the management of Yellow River have been a great political trouble to various Chinese dynasties throughout the history since ancient time.[73][74]\n\n\n\nWhen the Yellow River flows clear\nSometimes the Yellow River is poetically called the \"Muddy Flow\" (\u6fc1\u6d41; \u6d4a\u6d41; *Zhu\u00f3 Li\u00fa*). The Chinese idiom \"when the Yellow River flows clear\" is used to refer to an event that will never happen and is similar to the English expression \"when pigs fly\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\"The Yellow River running clear\" was reported as a good omen during the reign of the Yongle Emperor, along with the appearance of such auspicious legendary beasts as *qilin* (an African giraffe brought to China by a Bengal embassy aboard Zheng He's ships in 1414) and *zouyu* (not positively identified) and other strange natural phenomena.[75]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Central Plain (China)\n* Geography of China\n* He Bo\n* List of rivers in China\n* North China Plain\n* North China University of Water Conservancy and Electric Power\n* Water resources of China\n* Yellow River Cantata\n* Yellow River floods\n* Yellow River Map\n* Yellow River Piano Concerto\n* Yellow Sea\n* Red River (disambiguation)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Clapp, Frederick G.

This misled some scholars to believe the annotation existed in the first edition in the 1st century.[12] Li (2004) and Hargett (2021) propose that the earliest attestation of the Yellow River is the line \u5c01\u7235\u4e4b\u8a93\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u4f7f**\u9ec3\u6cb3**\u5982\u5e36\uff0c\u6cf0\u5c71\u82e5\u53b2\u3002\u570b\u4ee5\u6c38\u5be7\uff0c\u7230\u53ca\u82d7\u88d4\u3002\u300din vol. 16 of *Han Shu*;[12][13] yet Qing philologist Wang Niansun stated that the letter \u9ec3 was a later interpolation and did not exist in the first edition in the 1st century.[14] Excluding these problematic attestations in *Han Shu*, the two earliest attestations cited by Li (2004) came in 429 and 488.[12] In 429,[15] Pei Songzhi mentioned Yellow River twice in the chapter of \u8881\u7d39\u50b3 (Yuan Shao's biography) in \u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u6ce8 (*Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms*), \"\u300a\u9b4f\u6c0f\u6625\u79cb\u300b\u8f09\u7d39\u6a84\u5dde\u90e1\u6587\u66f0\uff1a\u300c...\u9a01\u826f\u5f13\u52c1\u5f29\u4e4b\u52e2\uff0c\u5e76\u5dde\u8d8a\u592a\u884c\uff0c\u9752\u5dde\u6d89\u6fdf\u3001\u6f2f\uff0c\u5927\u8ecd\u6c4e**\u9ec3\u6cb3**\u4ee5\u89d2\u5176\u524d...\u300d\", and \"\u737b\u5e1d\u50b3\u66f0\uff1a\u7d39\u5c07\u6fdf\u6cb3\uff0c\u6cae\u6388(Ju Shou)\u8aeb\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u52dd\u8ca0\u8b8a\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4e0d\u8a73\u3002\u4eca\u5b9c\u7559\u5c6f\u5ef6\u6d25\uff0c\u5206\u5175\u5b98\u6e21\uff0c\u82e5\u5176\u514b\u7372\uff0c\u9084\u8fce\u4e0d\u665a\uff0c\u8a2d\u5176\u6709\u96e3\uff0c\u8846\u5f17\u53ef\u9084\u3002\u300d\u7d39\u5f17\u5f9e\u3002\u6388\u81e8\u6fdf\u6b4e\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u4e0a\u76c8\u5176\u5fd7\uff0c\u4e0b\u52d9\u5176\u529f\uff0c\u60a0\u60a0**\u9ec3\u6cb3**\uff0c\u543e\u5176\u53cd\u4e4e\uff1f\u300d\" In 488,[16] Shen Yue mentioned Yellow River in the chapter \u7d22\u865c, volume \u5377\u4e5d\u5341\u4e94\u5217\u50b3\u7b2c\u4e94\u5341\u4e94 of \u5b8b\u66f8 (*Book of Song*), \"\u4e8c\u5341\u4e5d\u5e74[\u5b8b\u5143\u5609\u4e8c\u5341\u4e5d\u5e74, \u516c\u5143452\u5e74]\uff0c\u592a\u7956\u66f4\u9063\u5f35\u6c38\u3001\u738b\u7384\u8b28\u53ca\u723d\u7b49\u5317\u4f10\uff0c\u9752\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\u5289\u8208\u7956\u5efa\u8b70\u4f10\u6cb3\u5317\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u300c...\u611a\u8b02\u5b9c\u9577\u9a45\u4e2d\u5c71\uff0c\u64da\u5176\u95dc\u8981\u3002\u5180\u5dde\u5df2\u5317\uff0c\u6c11\u4eba\u5c1a\u8c50\uff0c\u517c\u9ea5\u5df2\u5411\u719f\uff0c\u8cc7\u56e0\u70ba\u6613\u3002\u5411\u7fa9\u4e4b\u5f92\uff0c\u5fc5\u61c9\u97ff\u8d74\uff0c\u82e5\u4e2d\u5dde\u9707\u52d5\uff0c**\u9ec3\u6cb3**\u4ee5\u5357\uff0c\u81ea\u7576\u6d88\u6f70\u3002\u300d\".\n2. **^** Deng (2015) proposes that the name \"Yellow River\" was favoured by Tang dynasty literati because there was a folk-etymological connection between \u9ec3 (\"yellow\") and \u5ee3 (\"wide\"), \u6a6b (\"broad\"), \u9404 (\"large bell\") and \u6f62 (\"large cistern\").[9] However, Schuessler (2007) proposes cognacy between \u9ec3 (\"yellow\") and Burmese \u101d\u1004\u103a\u1038 (*wang:*, \u201cbright\u201d) and \u101d\u102b (*wa*, \u201cyellow\u201d); meanwhile he states that \u5ee3 (\"wide\")'s etymology is uncertain: he relates it either to Mizo **vang** \u201cto be large, extensive\u201d and **v\u00e2ng** \u201cbreadth, width, broad, wide\u201d, or to Tibetan: \u0f61\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f54, Wylie: *yangs pa*, or to Thai \u0e01\u0e27\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07 *kw\u00e2a\u014b* \u201cto be broad, wide\u201d (< \u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07 *w\u00e2a\u014b* \u201cto be free, at leisure; to be vacant, unoccupied\u201d). He also cites Baxter & Sagart (1998: 60)'s opinion on a possible relation between \u5ee3 and \u5bec *ku\u0101n* \u201cwide\u201d; and that \u5ee3 is perhaps related to root \\**wa* of \u6cc1 *ku\u00e0ng*.[17]\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nLook up ***Yellow River***, ***China's Sorrow***, ***Huang He***, ***Huang Ho***, or ***Hwang Ho*** in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Yellow River.\n\n* The DELIGHT Project, Delta Information System for Geoenvironmental and Human Habitat Transition\n* Listen to the *Yellow River Ballade* from the Yellow River Cantata\n* First raft descent Archived 17 April 2009 at the Wayback Machine of the Yellow River from its source in Qinghai to its mouth (1987)\n* Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Strategies in the Yellow River Basin \u2013 UNESCO report\n\n\nWorks from the National Central Library about the Yellow River\n* \"Illustrations of Guarding the Yellow River\". *wdl.org*.

simplified Chinese: \u957f\u6c5f; traditional Chinese: \u9577\u6c5f; pinyin: *Ch\u00e1ng Ji\u0101ng*; lit. 'long river') is the longest river in Eurasia, the third-longest in the world, and the longest in the world to flow entirely within one country. It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows 6,300\u00a0km (3,915\u00a0mi) in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea.[8] It is the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world. Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China, and is home to nearly one-third of the country's population.[9]\n\n\nThe Yangtze has played a major role in the history, culture, and economy of China. For thousands of years, the river has been used for water, irrigation, sanitation, transportation, industry, boundary-marking, and war. The prosperous Yangtze Delta generates as much as 20% of China's GDP. The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world that is in use.[10][11] In mid-2014, the Chinese government announced it was building a multi-tier transport network, comprising railways, roads and airports, to create a new economic belt alongside the river.[12]\n\n\nThe Yangtze flows through a wide array of ecosystems and is habitat to several endemic and threatened species including the Chinese alligator, the narrow-ridged finless porpoise, and also was the home of the now extinct Yangtze river dolphin (or *baiji*) and Chinese paddlefish, as well as the Yangtze sturgeon, which is extinct in the wild. In recent years, the river has suffered from industrial pollution, plastic pollution,[13] agricultural runoff, siltation, and loss of wetland and lakes, which exacerbates seasonal flooding. Some sections of the river are now protected as nature reserves. A stretch of the upstream Yangtze flowing through deep gorges in western Yunnan is part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n### Chinese[edit]\n\n\n*Ch\u00e1ng Ji\u0101ng* (\u957f\u6c5f; \u9577\u6c5f) or \"**Long River**\" is the official name for the Yangtze in Mandarin Chinese. However, the Chinese have given different names to the upstream sections of the river up to its confluence with the Min River at Yibin, Sichuan.[14][15] Jinsha River (\"Gold Sands River\") refers to the 2,308\u00a0km (1,434\u00a0mi) of the Yangtze from Yibin upstream to the confluence with the Batang River near Yushu in Qinghai, while the Tongtian River (\"River that leads to Heaven\") describes the 813\u00a0km (505\u00a0mi) section from Yushu up to the confluence of the Tuotuo River and the Dangqu River.\n\n\nIn Old Chinese, the Yangtze was simply called *Jiang/Kiang* \u6c5f,[16] a character of phono-semantic compound origin, combining the water radical \u6c35 with the homophone \u5de5 (now pronounced *g\u014dng*, but *\\*k\u02e4o\u014b* in Old Chinese[17]). *Kong* was probably a word in the Austroasiatic language of local peoples such as the Yue. Similar to *\\*krong* in Proto-Vietnamese and *krung* in Mon, all meaning \"river\", it is related to modern Vietnamese *s\u00f4ng* (river) and Khmer *krung* (city on riverside), whence Thai *krung* (\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07 capital city), not *k\u00f4ngkea* (water) which is from the Sanskrit root *g\u00e1\u1e45g\u0101*.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)The \"Great River\" (\u5927\u6c5f) with its entrance to the East China Sea marked as the \"Mouth of the Yangtze\" (\u63da\u5b50\u6c5f\u53e3) on the Jiangnan map in the 1754 *Provincial Atlas of the Qing Empire*\nBy the Han dynasty, *Ji\u0101ng* had come to mean *any* river in Chinese, and this river was distinguished as the \"Great River\" \u5927\u6c5f (*D\u00e0ji\u0101ng*). The epithet \u9577 (simplified version \u957f), means \"long\", was first formally applied to the river during the Six Dynasties period.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nVarious sections of the Yangtze have local names. From Yibin to Yichang, the river through Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality is also known as the *Chu\u0101n Ji\u0101ng* (\u5ddd\u6c5f) or \"Sichuan River.\" In Hubei, the river is also called the *J\u012bng Ji\u0101ng* (\u8346\u6c5f; \u834a\u6c5f) or the \"Jing River\" after Jingzhou, one of the Nine Provinces of ancient China. In Anhui, the river takes on the local name *W\u01cen Ji\u0101ng* after the shorthand name for Anhui, *w\u01cen* (\u7696). And *Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0 Ji\u0101ng* (\u63da\u5b50\u6c5f; \u626c\u5b50\u6c5f) or the \"Yangzi River\", from which the English name Yangtze is derived, is the local name for the Lower Yangtze in the region of Yangzhou. The name likely comes from an ancient ferry crossing called *Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0* or *Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0j\u012bn* (\u63da\u5b50 / \u63da\u5b50\u6d25).[19] Europeans who arrived in the Yangtze River Delta region applied this local name to the whole river.[14] The dividing site between upstream and midstream is considered to be at Yichang and that between midstream and downstream at Hukou (Jiujiang).[20]\n\n\n\n### English[edit]\n\n\n\nThe river was called **Quian** (\u6c5f) and **Quianshui** (\u6c5f\u6c34) by Marco Polo[21] and appeared on the earliest English maps as **Kian** or **Kiam**,[22][23] which derives from Cantonese, all recording dialects which preserved forms of the Middle Chinese pronunciation of \u6c5f as *K\u00e6wng*.[16] By the mid-19th century, these romanizations had standardized as **Kiang**; *Dajiang*, e.g., was rendered as \"Ta-Kiang.\" \"Keeang-Koo,\"[24] \"Kyang Kew,\"[25] \"Kian-ku,\"[26] and related names derived from mistaking the Chinese term for the mouth of the Yangtze (\u6c5f\u53e3, p\u00a0*Ji\u0101ngk\u01d2u*) as the name of the river itself.\n\n\nThe name **Blue River** began to be applied in the 18th century,[22] apparently owing to a former name of the Dam Chu[28] or Min[30] and to analogy with the Yellow River,[31][32] but it was frequently explained in early English references as a 'translation' of *Jiang*,[33][34] *Jiangkou*,[24] or *Yangzijiang*.[35] Very common in 18th- and 19th-century sources, the name fell out of favor due to growing awareness of its lack of *any* connection to the river's Chinese names[36][37] and to the irony of its application to such a muddy waterway.[37][38]\n\n\nMatteo Ricci's 1615 Latin account included descriptions of the \"Ian\u017fu\" and \"Ian\u017fuchian.\"[39] The posthumous account's translation of the name as **Fils de la Mer** (\"Son of the Ocean\")[39][40] shows that Ricci, who by the end of his life was fluent in literary Chinese, was introduced to it as the homophonic \u6d0b\u5b50\u6c5f rather than the usual \u63da\u5b50\u6c5f. Further, although railroads and the Shanghai concessions subsequently turned it into a backwater, **Yang**zhou was the lower river's principal port for much of the Qing dynasty, directing Liangjiang's important salt monopoly and connecting the Yangtze with the Grand Canal to Beijing. (That connection also made it one of the Yellow River's principal ports between the floods of 1344 and the 1850s, during which time the Yellow River ran well south of Shandong and discharged into the ocean a mere few hundred kilometers from the mouth of the Yangtze.[36][26])\n\n\nBy 1800, English cartographers such as Aaron Arrowsmith had adopted the French style of the name[41] as **Yang-tse** or **Yang-tse\u00a0Kiang**.[42] The British diplomat Thomas Wade emended this to **Yang-tzu Chiang** as part of his formerly popular romanization of Chinese, based on the Beijing dialect instead of Nanjing's and first published in 1867. The spellings **Yangtze** and **Yangtze\u00a0Kiang** was a compromise between the two methods adopted at the 1906 Imperial Postal Conference in Shanghai, which established postal romanization. Hanyu Pinyin was adopted by the PRC's First Congress in 1958, but it was not widely employed in English outside mainland China prior to the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and the PRC in 1979; since that time, the spelling **Yangzi** has also been used.\n\n\n\n### Tibetan[edit]\n\n\n\nThe source and upper reaches of the Yangtze are located in ethnic Tibetan areas of Qinghai.[43] In Tibetan, the Tuotuo headwaters are the *Machu* (Tibetan: \u0f62\u0fa8\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f74\u0f0b, Wylie: *rma-chu*, lit. \"Red Water\"). The Tongtian is the *Drichu* (\u0f60\u0f56\u0fb2\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f74\u0f0b , \u2018Bri Chu\u2019), literally \"Water of the Female Yak\"; transliterated into Chinese: \u76f4\u66f2; pinyin: *Zh\u00edq\u016b*).\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A topographical map of China depicting the Yangtze's steady course and the former route of the Yellow River south of Shandong to the Huai mouth, after its stabilization by the Grand Eunuch Li Xing's public works following the 1494 flood\nThe river originates from several tributaries in the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, two of which are commonly referred to as the \"source.\" Traditionally, the Chinese government has recognized the source as the Tuotuo tributary at the base of a glacier lying on the west of Geladandong Mountain in the Tanggula Mountains. This source is found at 33\u00b025\u203244\u2033N 91\u00b010\u203257\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff33.42889\u00b0N 91.18250\u00b0E\ufeff / 33.42889; 91.18250 and while not the furthest source of the Yangtze, it is the highest source at 5,342\u00a0m (17,526\u00a0ft) above sea level. The true source of the Yangtze, hydrologically the longest river distance from the sea, is at Jari Hill at the head of the Dam Qu tributary, approximately 325\u00a0km (202\u00a0mi) southeast of Geladandong.[44] This source was only discovered in the late 20th century and lies in wetlands at 32\u00b036\u203214\u2033N 94\u00b030\u203244\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff32.60389\u00b0N 94.51222\u00b0E\ufeff / 32.60389; 94.51222 and 5,170\u00a0m (16,960\u00a0ft) above sea level just southeast of Chadan Township in Zadoi County, Yushu Prefecture, Qinghai.[45] As the historical spiritual source of the Yangtze, the Geladandong source is still commonly referred to as the source of the Yangtze since the discovery of the Jari Hill source.[44]\n\n\nThese tributaries join and the river then runs eastward through Qinghai (Tsinghai), turning southward down a deep valley at the border of Sichuan (Szechwan) and Tibet to reach Yunnan. In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above 5,000\u00a0m (16,000\u00a0ft) to less than 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). Thus, over the first 2,600\u00a0km (1,600\u00a0mi) of its length, the river has fallen more than 5,200\u00a0m (17,000\u00a0ft).[46]\n\n\nIt enters the basin of Sichuan at Yibin. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through Mount Wushan bordering Chongqing and Hubei to create the famous Three Gorges. Eastward of the Three Gorges, Yichang is the first city on the Yangtze Plain.\n\n\nAfter entering Hubei province, the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes. The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake, which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At Wuhan, it receives its biggest tributary, the Han River, bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi.\n\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi province, Lake Poyang, the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai.\n\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.\n\n\nThe origin of the Yangtze River has been dated by some geologists to about 45\u00a0million years ago in the Eocene,[47] but this dating has been disputed.

Based on studies of sedimentation rates, however, it is unlikely that the present discharge site predates the late Miocene (c.\u200911 Ma).[51] Prior to this, its headwaters drained south into the Gulf of Tonkin along or near the course of the present Red River.[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Afternoon in the jagged mountains rising from the Yangtze River gorge\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Baiyue, state of Wu, state of Yue, state of Chu, Yangtze civilization, and Southward expansion of the Han Dynasty\n\nThe Yangtze River is important to the cultural origins of southern China and Japan.[53] Human activity has been verified in the Three Gorges area as far back as 27,000 years ago,[54] and by the 5th millennium\u00a0BC, the lower Yangtze was a major population center occupied by the Hemudu and Majiabang cultures, both among the earliest cultivators of rice. By the 3rd millennium\u00a0BC, the successor Liangzhu culture showed evidence of influence from the Longshan peoples of the North China Plain.[55] What is now thought of as Chinese culture developed along the more fertile Yellow River basin; the \"Yue\" people of the lower Yangtze possessed very different traditions \u2013 blackening their teeth, cutting their hair short, tattooing their bodies, and living in small settlements among bamboo groves[56] \u2013 and were considered barbarous by the northerners.\n\n\nThe Central Yangtze valley was home to sophisticated Neolithic cultures.[57] Later it became the earliest part of the Yangtze valley to be integrated into the North Chinese cultural sphere. (Northern Chinese were active there since the Bronze Age).[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)A map of the Warring States around 350 BC, showing the former coastline of the Yangtze delta\nIn the lower Yangtze, two Yue tribes, the *Gouwu* in southern Jiangsu and the *Yuyue* in northern Zhejiang, display increasing Zhou (i.e., North Chinese) influence starting in the 9th century\u00a0BC. Traditional accounts[59] credit these changes to northern refugees (Taibo and Zhongyong in Wu and Wuyi in Yue) who assumed power over the local tribes, though these are generally assumed to be myths invented to legitimate them to other Zhou rulers. As the kingdoms of Wu and Yue, they were famed as fishers, shipwrights, and sword-smiths. Adopting Chinese characters, political institutions, and military technology, they were among the most powerful states during the later Zhou. In the middle Yangtze, the state of Jing seems to have begun in the upper Han River valley a minor Zhou polity, but it adapted to native culture as it expanded south and east into the Yangtze valley. In the process, it changed its name to Chu.[60]\n\n\nWhether native or nativizing, the Yangtze states held their own against the northern Chinese homeland: some lists credit them with three of the Spring and Autumn period's Five Hegemons and one of the Warring States' Four Lords. They fell in against themselves, however. Chu's growing power led its rival Jin to support Wu as a counter. Wu successfully sacked Chu's capital Ying in 506\u00a0BC, but Chu subsequently supported Yue in its attacks against Wu's southern flank. In 473\u00a0BC, King Goujian of Yue fully annexed Wu and moved his court to its eponymous capital at modern Suzhou. In 333\u00a0BC, Chu finally united the lower Yangtze by annexing Yue, whose royal family was said to have fled south and established the Minyue kingdom in Fujian. Qin was able to unite China by first subduing Ba and Shu on the upper Yangtze in modern Sichuan, giving them a strong base to attack Chu's settlements along the river.\n\n\nThe state of Qin conquered the central Yangtze region, previous heartland of Chu, in 278 BC, and incorporated the region into its expanding empire. Qin then used its connections along the Yangtze River the Xiang River to expand China into Hunan, Jiangxi and Guangdong, setting up military commanderies along the main lines of communication. At the collapse of the Qin Dynasty, these southern commanderies became the independent Nanyue Empire under Zhao Tuo while Chu and Han vied with each other for control of the north.\n\n\nSince the Han dynasty, the region of the Yangtze River grew ever more important to China's economy. The establishment of irrigation systems (the most famous one is Dujiangyan, northwest of Chengdu, built during the Warring States period) made agriculture very stable and productive, eventually exceeding even the Yellow River region. The Qin and Han empires were actively engaged in the agricultural colonization of the Yangtze lowlands, maintaining a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods.[61] By the Song dynasty, the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country, especially in the lower reaches of the river. Early in the Qing dynasty, the region called Jiangnan (that includes the southern part of Jiangsu, the northern part of Zhejiang, and the southeastern part of Anhui) provided 1\u20443\u20131\u20442 of the nation's revenues.\n\n\nThe Yangtze has long been the backbone of China's inland water transportation system, which remained particularly important for almost two thousand years, until the construction of the national railway network during the 20th century. The Grand Canal connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the Jiangnan region south of the river (Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou) and with northern China (all the way from Yangzhou to Beijing). The less well known ancient Lingqu Canal, connecting the upper Xiang River with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the Pearl River Delta.[62]\n\n\nHistorically, the Yangtze became the political boundary between north China and south China several times (see History of China) because of the difficulty of crossing the river. This occurred notably during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and the Southern Song. Many battles took place along the river, the most famous being the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 AD during the Three Kingdoms period.\n\n\nThe Yangtze was the site of naval battles between the Song dynasty and Jurchen Jin during the Jin\u2013Song wars. In the Battle of Caishi of 1161, the ships of the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang clashed with the Song fleet on the Yangtze. Song soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulfur using trebuchets at the Jurchen warships. The battle was a Song victory that halted the invasion by the Jin.[63][64] The Battle of Tangdao was another Yangtze naval battle in the same year.\n\n\nPolitically, Nanjing was the capital of China several times, although most of the time its territory only covered the southeastern part of China, such as the Wu kingdom in the Three Kingdoms period, the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and during the Southern and Northern Dynasties and Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms periods. Only the Ming occupied most parts of China from their capital at Nanjing, though it later moved the capital to Beijing. The ROC capital was located in Nanjing in the periods 1911\u201312, 1927\u201337, and 1945\u201349.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n*Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River*, a Ming dynasty landscape painting\n\n### Age of steam[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China Station\n\nThe *Jardine*, the first steamship to sail the river, was built for Jardine, Matheson & Co. in 1835. This small vessel was to carry passengers and mail between Lintin Island, Macao, and Huangpu. However, the Chinese, draconian in their application of the rules relating to foreign vessels, were unhappy about a \"fire-ship\" steaming up the Canton River. The acting Viceroy of Liangguang issued an edict warning that she would be fired on if she attempted the trip.[65] On the *Jardine's* first trial run from Lintin Island the forts on both sides of the Bogue opened fire and she was forced to turn back. The Chinese authorities issued a further warning insisting that the ship leave Chinese waters. The *Jardine* in any case needed repairs and was sent to Singapore.[66]  \nSubsequently, Lord Palmerston, the Foreign Secretary decided mainly on the \"suggestions\" of William Jardine to declare war on China. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannonball fired at a British ship, the *Royal Saxon*, the British started the first of the Opium Wars. Royal Navy warships destroyed numerous shore batteries and Chinese warships, laying waste to several coastal forts along the way. Eventually, they pushed their way up north close enough to threaten the Imperial Palace in Beijing itself.[65]\n\n\nThe China Navigation Company was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in London, initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after, and in 1883 a regular service to Australia was initiated.[65]\n\n\n\nYangtze River steam boats filmed in 1937\n![](image)USS *Luzon*\n### Navigation on the upper river[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yangtze in 1915\n![](image)Cruise boats on Yangtze\n![](image)A vehicle carrier on Yangtze\n![](image)A container carrier on Yangtze\nSteamers came late to the upper river, the section stretching from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But summer was better navigationally and the three gorges, described as a \"150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass,\" posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 \u2013 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70\u201380 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver through some of the most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges.[67] Achibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the Chefoo Convention opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built *Kuling* but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties, competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their crafts caused by steamship wakes. *Kuling* was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service. In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade as long as it was restricted to native crafts. In 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade. Little took up residence in Chongqing and built *Leechuan*, to tackle the gorges in 1898. In March *Leechuan* completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers. *Leechuan* was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot.[68] In 1898, Little persuaded Captain Samuel Cornell Plant to come out to China to lend his expertise. Captain Plant had just completed navigation of Persia's Upper Karun River and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on *Leechuan* at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had SS *Pioneer* built with Plant in command. In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing. *Pioneer* was sold to Royal Navy after its first run due to threat from the Boxer Rebellion and renamed HMS *Kinsha*. Germany's steamship effort that same year on SS *Suixing* ended in catastrophe. On *Suixing's* maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze. In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing. Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS *Shutung* and SS *Shuhun*. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too. Plant was appointed by Chinese Maritime Customs Service as First Senior River Inspector in 1915. In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems. He also wrote *Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River*, a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction. Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze. Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield and Swire and Standard Oil added their own steamers on the river between 1917 and 1919. Between 1918 and 1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business.[69] *Shutung* was commandeered by warlords and *Shuhun* was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping.[70] In 1921, when Captain Plant died at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation. The largest shipping companies in service, Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil, Mackenzie & Co., Asiatic Petroleum, Robert Dollar, China Merchants S.N. Co. and British-American Tobacco Co., contributed alongside international friends and Chinese pilots. In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners. One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English. Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.[71][72]\n\n\nStandard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, which were collectively destroyed on December 12, 1937, when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.[73]\n\n\n\n### Navy ships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Imperial Japanese Navy armored cruiser *Izumo* in Shanghai in 1937. She sank riverboats on the Yangtze in 1941.\nSee also: USS Asheville (PG-21), Yangtze Patrol, and Yangtze Incident\n\n### Contemporary events[edit]\n\n\nChinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong took staged swims in the river in 1956 and 1966 at Wuhan in publicity stunts to demonstrate his health, also starting a swimming craze through party propaganda.[74][75]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Welsh adventurer Ash Dykes became the first person to complete the 4,000-mile (6,437\u00a0km) trek along the course of the river, walking for 352 days from its source to its mouth.[76]\n\n\n\n## Hydrology[edit]\n\n\n### Periodic floods[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of deadliest floods\n\nTens of millions of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes. The floods large enough to overflow the dikes have caused great distress to those who live and farm there. Floods of note include those of 1931, 1954, and 1998.\n\n\nThe 1931 Central China floods or the Central China floods of 1931 were a series of floods that occurred in the Republic of China. The floods are generally considered among the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded, and almost certainly the deadliest of the 20th century (when pandemics and famines are discounted). Estimates of the total death toll range from 145,000 to between 3.7\u00a0million and 4\u00a0million.[77][78] The Yangtze again flooded in 1935, causing great loss of life.\n\n\nFrom June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan. The number of dead from this flood was estimated at 33,000, including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\n\nThe 1998 Yangtze River floods were a series of major floods that lasted from middle of June to the beginning of September 1998 along the Yangtze.[79]\nIn the summer of 1998, China experienced massive flooding of parts of the Yangtze River, resulting in 3,704 dead, 15\u00a0million homeless and $26\u00a0billion in economic loss.[80] Other sources report a total loss of 4150 people, and 180\u00a0million people were affected.[81] A staggering 25\u00a0million acres (100,000\u00a0km2) were evacuated, 13.3\u00a0million houses were damaged or destroyed. The floods caused $26\u00a0billion in damages.[81]\n\n\nThe 2016 China floods caused US$22\u00a0billion in damages.\n\n\nIn 2020, the Yangtze river saw the heaviest rainfall since 1961, with a 79% increase in June and July compared to the average for the period over the previous 41 years. A new theory suggested that abrupt reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, caused by shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, was a key cause of the intense downpours. Over the past decades rainfall had decreased due to increase of aerosols in the atmosphere, and lower greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 caused the opposite effect \u2013 a major increase in rain. Such a dramatic reduction of aerosols caused a dramatic change in the various components of the climate system, but such sudden change of the climate system would be very different from changes in response to continuous but gradual policy-driven emissions reductions.[82]\n\n\n\n### Degradation of the river[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Water resources in China \u00a7\u00a0Water quality\n\n![](image)Barges on the river\nBeginning in the 1950s, dams and dikes were built for flood control, land reclamation, irrigation, and control of diseases vectors such as blood flukes that caused Schistosomiasis. More than a hundred lakes were thusly cut off from the main river.[83] There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction.[84] Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, Baidang Lake shrunk from 100 square kilometers (39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in the 1950s to 40 square kilometers (15\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in 2005. Zhangdu Lake dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of carp who thrived in eutrophic water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage.[83][85] In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution.[86] The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable \"iron barrier\" that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the baiji dolphin, narrow-ridged finless porpoise and the Yangtze alligator. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.[87]\n\n\nIn 2020, a sweeping law was passed by the Chinese government to protect the ecology of the river. The new laws include strengthening ecological protection rules for hydropower projects along the river, banning chemical plants within 1 kilometer of the river, relocating polluting industries, severely restricting sand mining as well as a complete fishing ban on all the natural waterways of the river, including all its major tributaries and lakes.[88]\n\n\n\n### Contribution to ocean pollution[edit]\n\n\nThe Yangtze River produces more ocean plastic pollution than any other, according to The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch environmental research foundation that focuses on ocean pollution. 10 Rivers transport 90% of all the plastic that reaches the oceans, the Yangtze river being the biggest polluter by far.[89][90]\n\n\n\n### Reconnecting lakes[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002 a pilot program was initiated to reconnect lakes to the Yangtze with the objective to increase biodiversity and to alleviate flooding. The first lakes to be reconnected in 2004 were Zhangdu Lake, Honghu Lake, and Tian'e-Zhou in Hubei on the middle Yangtze. In 2005 Baidang Lake in Anhui was also reconnected.[85]\n\n\nReconnecting the lakes improved water quality and fish were able to migrate from the river into the lake, replenishing their numbers and genetic stock. The trial also showed that reconnecting the lake reduced flooding. The new approach also benefitted the farmers economically. Pond farmers switched to natural fish feed, which helped them breed better-quality fish that can be sold for more, increasing their income by 30%. Based on the successful pilot project, other provincial governments emulated the experience and also reestablished connections to lakes that had previously been cut off from the river. In 2005 a Yangtze Forum has been established bringing together 13 riparian provincial governments to manage the river from source to sea.[91] In 2006 China's Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes. As of 2010, provincial governments in five provinces and Shanghai set up a network of 40 effective protected areas, covering 16,500\u00a0km2 (6,400\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). As a result, populations of 47 threatened species increased, including the critically endangered Yangtze alligator. In the Shanghai area, reestablished wetlands now protect drinking water sources for the city. It is envisaged to extend the network throughout the entire Yangtze to eventually cover 102 areas and 185,000\u00a0km2 (71,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The mayor of Wuhan announced that six huge, stagnating urban lakes including the East Lake (Wuhan) would be reconnected at the cost of US$2.3\u00a0billion creating China's largest urban wetland landscape.[83][92]\n\n\n\n## Major cities along the river[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Populated places on the Yangtze River\n\n![](image)Map of the Yangtze river (facing west) showing the major settlements along its banks\n* Yushu\n* Panzhihua\n* Yibin\n* Luzhou\n* Hejiang\n* Chongqing\n* Fuling\n* Fengdu\n* Wanzhou\n* Yichang\n* Yidu\n* Jingzhou\n* Shashi\n* Shishou\n* Yueyang\n* Xianning\n* Wuhan\n* Ezhou\n* Huangshi\n* Huanggang\n* Chaohu\n* Chizhou\n* Jiujiang\n* Anqing\n* Tongling\n* Wuhu\n* Chuzhou\n* Ma'anshan\n* Taizhou\n* Yangzhou\n* Zhenjiang\n* Nanjing\n* Changzhou\n* Nantong\n* Shanghai\n\n## Crossings[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bridges and tunnels across the Yangtze River and Yangtze River power line crossings\n\n**Map all coordinates in \"Yangtze River bridges and tunnels\" using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\nUntil 1957, there were no bridges across the Yangtze River from Yibin to Shanghai. For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry. On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the *Zhong'anlun* disaster (October 15, 1945).\n\n\nThe river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China. In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at Hanyang and Pukou, and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train from Wuchang or Nanjing West.\n\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Soviet engineers assisted in the design and construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, a dual-use road-rail bridge, built from 1955 to 1957. It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River. The second bridge across the river that was built was a single-track railway bridge built upstream in Chongqing in 1959. The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze, in Nanjing. It was built after the Sino-Soviet Split and did not receive foreign assistance. Road-rail bridges were then built in Zhicheng (1971) and Chongqing (1980).\n\n\nBridge-building slowed in the 1980s before resuming in the 1990s and accelerating in the first decade of the 21st century. The Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge was built in 1992 as part of the Beijing-Jiujiang Railway. A second bridge in Wuhan was completed in 1995. By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai. These include some of the longest suspension and cable-stayed bridges in the world on the Yangtze Delta: Jiangyin Suspension Bridge (1,385 m, opened in 1999), Runyang Bridge (1,490 m, opened 2005), Sutong Bridge (1,088 m, opened 2008). The rapid pace of bridge construction has continued. The city of Wuhan now has six bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze.\n\n\nA number of power line crossings have also been built across the river.\n\n\n\n* ![Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the first bridge crossing Yangtze, was completed in 1957.](image)\n\nWuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the first bridge crossing Yangtze, was completed in 1957.\n* ![The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, a beam bridge, was completed in 1968.](image)\n\nThe Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, a beam bridge, was completed in 1968.\n* ![The Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge, an arch bridge, was completed in 1992.](image)\n\nThe Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge, an arch bridge, was completed in 1992.\n* ![The Yichang Yangtze Highway Bridge, a suspension bridge near the Gezhouba Dam lock, was completed in 1996.](image)\n\nThe Yichang Yangtze Highway Bridge, a suspension bridge near the Gezhouba Dam lock, was completed in 1996.\n* ![The Sutong Yangtze River Bridge, between Nantong and Suzhou, was one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in the world when it was completed in 2008.](image)\n\nThe Sutong Yangtze River Bridge, between Nantong and Suzhou, was one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in the world when it was completed in 2008.\n* ![The Caiyuanba Bridge, an arch bridge in Chongqing, was completed in 2007.](image)\n\nThe Caiyuanba Bridge, an arch bridge in Chongqing, was completed in 2007.\n* ![The cable-stayed Anqing Yangtze River Bridge at Anqing, was completed in 2005.](image)\n\nThe cable-stayed Anqing Yangtze River Bridge at Anqing, was completed in 2005.\n* ![Wuhan Metro Line 2 is the first underground rail line crossing the Yangtze River.](image)\n\nWuhan Metro Line 2 is the first underground rail line crossing the Yangtze River.\n\n\n## Dams[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Three Gorges Dam in 2006\n![](image)Diagram showing dams planned for the upper reaches of the Yangtze River\nAs of 2007, there are two dams built on the Yangtze river: Three Gorges Dam and Gezhouba Dam. The Three Gorges Dam is the largest power station in the world by installed capacity, at 22.5 GW. Several dams are operating or are being constructed on the upper portion of the river, the Jinsha River. Among them, the Xiluodu Dam is the third largest power station in the world, and the Baihetan Dam, planned to be commissioned in 2021, will be the second largest after the Three Gorges Dam.\n\n\n\n## Tributaries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A shipyard on the banks of the Yangtze building commercial river freight boats\nThe Yangtze River has over 700 tributaries. The major tributaries (listed from upstream to downstream) with the locations of where they join the Yangtze are:\n\n\n\n* Yalong River (Panzhihua, Sichuan)\n* Min River (Yibin, Sichuan)\n* Tuo River (Luzhou, Sichuan)\n* Chishui River (Hejiang, Sichuan)\n* Jialing River (Chongqing)\n* Wu River (Fuling, Chongqing)\n* Qing River (Yidu, Hubei)\n* Yuan River (via Dongting Lake)\n* Lishui River (via Dongting Lake)\n* Zi River (via Dongting Lake)\n* Xiang River (Yueyang, Hunan)\n* Han River (Wuhan, Hubei)\n* Gan River (near Jiujiang, Jiangxi)\n* Shuiyang River (Dangtu, Anhui)\n* Qingyi River (Wuhu, Anhui)\n* Chao Lake water system (Chaohu, Anhui)\n* Lake Tai water system (Shanghai)\n\n\nThe Huai River flowed into the Yellow Sea until the 20th century, but now primarily discharges into the Yangtze.\n\n\n\n* ![Gan River in Jiangxi](image)\n\nGan River in Jiangxi\n* ![Han River in Hubei](image)\n\nHan River in Hubei\n* ![Lake Dongting and the Yuan, Zi, Li, and Xiang Rivers in Hunan](image)\n\nLake Dongting and the Yuan, Zi, Li, and Xiang Rivers in Hunan\n* ![Wu River in Guizhou](image)\n\nWu River in Guizhou\n* ![Jialing River in eastern Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality](image)\n\nJialing River in eastern Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality\n* ![Min River in central Sichuan](image)\n\nMin River in central Sichuan\n* ![Yalong River in western Sichuan](image)\n\nYalong River in western Sichuan\n\n\n## Protected areas[edit]\n\n\n* Sanjiangyuan (\"Three Rivers' Sources\") National Nature Reserve in Qinghai\n* Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan\n\n\n## Wildlife[edit]\n\n\nThe Yangtze River has a high species richness, including many endemics. A high percentage of these are seriously threatened by human activities.[93]\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The two sturgeon species in the Yangtze (here Chinese sturgeon) are both seriously threatened.\nAs of 2011[update], 416 fish species are known from the Yangtze basin, including 362 that strictly are freshwater species. The remaining are also known from salt or brackish waters, such as the river's estuary or the East China Sea. This makes it one of the most species-rich rivers in Asia and by far the most species-rich in China (in comparison, the Pearl River has almost 300 fish species and the Yellow River 160).[93] 178 fish species are endemic to the Yangtze River Basin.[93] Many are only found in some section of the river basin and especially the upper reach (above Yichang, but below the headwaters in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) is rich with 279 species, including 147 Yangtze endemics and 97 strict endemics (found only in this part of the basin). In contrast, the headwaters, where the average altitude is above 4,500\u00a0m (14,800\u00a0ft), are only home to 14 highly specialized species, but 8 of these are endemic to the river.[93] The largest orders in the Yangtze are Cypriniformes (280 species, including 150 endemics), Siluriformes (40 species, including 20 endemics), Perciformes (50 species, including 4 endemics), Tetraodontiformes (12 species, including 1 endemic) and Osmeriformes (8 species, including 1 endemic). No other order has more than four species in the river and one endemic.[93]\n\n\nMany Yangtze fish species have declined drastically and 65 were recognized as threatened in the 2009 Chinese red list.[94] Among these are three that are considered entirely extinct (Chinese paddlefish, *Anabarilius liui liui* and *Atrilinea macrolepis*), two that are extinct in the wild (*Anabarilius polylepis*, *Schizothorax parvus*), four that are critically endangered *Euchiloglanis kishinouyei*, *Megalobrama elongata*, *Schizothorax longibarbus* and *Leiocassis longibarbus*).[94][95] Additionally, both the Yangtze sturgeon and Chinese sturgeon are considered critically endangered by the IUCN. The survival of these two sturgeon may rely on the continued release of captive bred specimens.[96][97] Although still listed as critically endangered rather than extinct by both the Chinese red list and IUCN, recent reviews have found that the Chinese paddlefish is extinct.[98][99] Surveys conducted between 2006 and 2008 by ichthyologists failed to catch any, but two probable specimens were recorded with hydroacoustic signals.[100] The last definite record was an individual that was accidentally captured near Yibin in 2003 and released after having been radio tagged.[95] The Chinese sturgeon is the largest fish in the river and among the largest freshwater fish in the world, reaching a length of 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft); the extinct Chinese paddlefish reputedly reached as much as 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft), but its maximum size is labeled with considerable uncertainty.[101][102][103]\n\n\n\n![](image)The silver carp is native to the river, but has (like other Asian carp) been spread through large parts of the world with aquaculture.\nThe largest threats to the Yangtze native fish are overfishing and habitat loss (such as building of dams and land reclamation), but pollution, destructive fishing practices (such as fishing with dynamite or poison) and introduced species also cause problems.[93] About 2\u20443 of the total freshwater fisheries in China are in the Yangtze Basin,[104] but a drastic decline in size of several important species has been recorded, as highlighted by data from lakes in the river basin.[93] In 2015, some experts recommend a 10-year fishing moratorium to allow the remaining populations to recover,[105] and in January 2020 China imposed a 10-year fishing moratorium on 332 sites along the Yangtze.[106] Dams present another serious problem, as several species in the river perform breeding migrations and most of these are non-jumpers, meaning that normal fish ladders designed for salmon are ineffective.[93] For example, the Gezhouba Dam blocked the migration of the paddlerfish and two sturgeon,[96][97][102] while also effectively splitting the Chinese high fin banded shark population into two[107] and causing the extirpation of the Yangtze population of the Japanese eel.[108] In an attempt of minimizing the effect of the dams, the Three Gorges Dam has released water to mimic the (pre-dam) natural flooding and trigger the breeding of carp species downstream.[109] In addition to dams already built in the Yangtze basin, several large dams are planned and these may present further problems for the native fauna.[109]\n\n\nWhile many fish species native to the Yangtze are seriously threatened, others have become important in fish farming and introduced widely outside their native range. A total of 26 native fish species of the Yangtze basin are farmed.[105] Among the most important are four Asian carp: grass carp, black carp, silver carp and bighead carp. Other species that support important fisheries include northern snakehead, Chinese perch, *Takifugu* pufferfish (mainly in the lowermost sections) and predatory carp.[93]\n\n\n\n### Other animals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The critically endangered Chinese alligator is one of the smallest crocodilians, reaching a maximum length of about 2\u00a0m (7\u00a0ft).[110]\nDue to commercial use of the river, tourism, and pollution, the Yangtze is home to several seriously threatened species of large animals (in addition to fish): the narrow-ridged finless porpoise, baiji (Yangtze river dolphin), Chinese alligator, Yangtze giant softshell turtle and Chinese giant salamander. This is the only other place besides the United States that is native to an alligator and paddlefish species. In 2010, the Yangtze population of finless porpoise was 1000 individuals. In December 2006, the Yangtze river dolphin was declared functionally extinct after an extensive search of the river revealed no signs of the dolphin's inhabitance.[111] In 2007, a large, white animal was sighted and photographed in the lower Yangtze and was tentatively presumed to be a *baiji*.[112] However, as there have been no confirmed sightings since 2004, the *baiji* is presumed to be functionally extinct at this time.[113] \"Baijis were the last surviving species of a large lineage dating back seventy million years and one of only six species of freshwater dolphins.\" It has been argued that the extinction of the Yangtze river dolphin was a result of the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, a project that has affected many species of animals and plant life found only in the gorges area.[114]\n\n\nNumerous species of land mammals are found in the Yangtze valley, but most of these are not directly associated with the river. Three exceptions are the semi-aquatic Eurasian otter, water deer and P\u00e8re David's deer.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)The entirely aquatic Chinese giant salamander is the world's largest amphibian, reaching up to 1.8\u00a0m (5.9\u00a0ft) in length.[116]\nIn addition to the very large and exceptionally rare Yangtze giant softshell turtle, several smaller turtle species are found in the Yangtze basin, its delta and valleys. These include the Chinese box turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Pan's box turtle, Yunnan box turtle, yellow pond turtle, Chinese pond turtle, Chinese stripe-necked turtle and Chinese softshell turtle, which all are considered threatened.[117]\n\n\nMore than 160 amphibian species are known from the Yangtze basin, including the world's largest, the critically endangered Chinese giant salamander.[118] It has declined drastically due to hunting (it is considered a delicacy), habitat loss and pollution.[116] The polluted Dian Lake, which is part of the upper Yangtze watershed (via Pudu River), is home to several highly threatened fish, but was also home to the Yunnan lake newt. This newt has not been seen since 1979 and is considered extinct.[119][120] In contrast, the Chinese fire belly newt from the lower Yangtze basin is one of the few Chinese salamander species to remain common and it is considered least concern by the IUCN.[120][121][122]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Chinese mitten crab is a commercially important species in the Yangtze,[123] but invasive in other parts of the world.[124]\nThe Yangtze basin contains a large number of freshwater crab species, including several endemics.[125] A particularly rich genus in the river basin is the potamid *Sinopotamon*.[126] The Chinese mitten crab is catadromous (migrates between fresh and saltwater) and it has been recorded up to 1,400\u00a0km (870\u00a0mi) up the Yangtze, which is the largest river in its native range.[124] It is a commercially important species in its native range where it is farmed,[123] but the Chinese mitten crab has also been spread to Europe and North America where considered invasive.[124]\n\n\nThe freshwater jellyfish *Craspedacusta sowerbii*, now an invasive species in large parts of the world, originates from the Yangtze.[127]\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\nThe Yangtze River cruise, also called the \"Three Gorges cruise\", is a popular tourist attraction.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Category: Tributaries of the Yangtze River\n* List of rivers in China\n* Northern and Southern China, traditionally divided by the Huai River but sometimes considered to separate at the Yangtze\n* *Rediscovering the Yangtze River*\n* Ship lifts in China\n* South-North Water Transfer Project\n* Steamboats on the Yangtze River\n* Yangtze River Crossing\n* Yangtze Service Medal\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Yangtze River http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110538/Yangtze-River Archived August 21, 2008, at the Wayback Machine\n2. **^** Zhang Zengxin; Tao Hui; Zhang Qiang; Zhang Jinchi; Forher, Nicola; H\u00f6rmann, Georg (2009). \"Moisture budget variations in the Yangtze River Basin, China, and possible associations with large-scale circulation\". *Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment*. **24** (5): 579\u2013589. doi:10.1007/s00477-009-0338-7.

It is the world's twelfth-longest river and the third-longest in Asia[1] with an estimated length of 4,909\u00a0km (3,050\u00a0mi)[1] and a drainage area of 795,000\u00a0km2 (307,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), discharging 475\u00a0km3 (114\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) of water annually.[2]\nFrom its headwaters in the Tibetan Plateau, the river runs through Southwest China (where it is officially called the **Lancang River**), Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and southern Vietnam. The extreme seasonal variations in flow and the presence of rapids and waterfalls in the Mekong make navigation difficult. Even so, the river is a major trade route between Tibet and Southeast Asia. The construction of hydroelectric dams along the Mekong in recent decades causes serious problems for the river's ecosystem, including the exacerbation of drought.[3][4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\nThe Mekong was originally called *Mae Nam Khong* from a contracted form of Tai shortened to *Mae Khong*.[6] In Thai and Lao, *Mae Nam* (\"Mother of Water[s]\") is used for large rivers and *Khong* is the proper name referred to as \"River Khong\". However, *Khong* is an archaic word meaning \"river\", loaned from Austroasiatic languages, such as Vietnamese *s\u00f4ng* (from \\**krong*) and Mon *kru\u014b* \"river\", which led to Chinese \u6c5f whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as /\\*k\u02e4ro\u014b/[7] and which long served as the proper name of the Yangtze before becoming a generic word for major rivers. To the early European traders, the Mekong River was also known as *Mekon River*, *May-Kiang River* and *Cambodia River*.[8]\n[9][10]\n[11][12]\n\n\nThe local names for the river include:\n\n\n\n1.

It originates in the \"three rivers source area\" on the Tibetan Plateau in the Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve. The reserve protects the headwaters of, from north to south, the Yellow (Huang He), the Yangtze, and the Mekong Rivers.[2] It flows through the Tibetan Autonomous Region and then southeast into Yunnan Province, and then the Three Parallel Rivers Area in the Hengduan Mountains, along with the Yangtze to its east and the Salween River (Nu Jiang in Chinese) to its west.\n\n\nThen the Mekong meets the China\u2013Myanmar border and flows about 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) along that border until it reaches the tripoint of China, Myanmar and Laos. From there it flows southwest and forms the border of Myanmar and Laos for about 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) until it arrives at the tripoint of Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand. This is also the point of confluence between the Ruak River (which follows the Thai\u2013Myanmar border) and the Mekong. The area of this tripoint is sometimes termed the Golden Triangle, although the term also refers to the much larger area of those three countries that was notorious as a drug producing region.\n\n\nFrom the Golden Triangle tripoint, the Mekong turns southeast to briefly form the border of Laos with Thailand.\n\n\nKhon Pi Long is a series of rapids along a 1.6-kilometre section of the Mekong River dividing Chiang Rai and Bokeo Province in Laos. The name of the rapids means 'where the ghost lost its way'.[13] It then turns east into the interior of Laos, flowing first east and then south for some 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) before meeting the border with Thailand again. Once more, it defines the Laos-Thailand border for some 850\u00a0km (530\u00a0mi) as it flows first east, passing the capital of Laos, Vientiane, then turns south. A second time, the river leaves the border and flows east into Laos soon passing the city of Pakse. Thereafter, it turns and runs more or less directly south, crossing into Cambodia.\n\n\nAt Phnom Penh the river is joined on the right bank by the river and lake system the Tonl\u00e9 Sap. When the Mekong is low, the Tonle Sap is a tributary: water flows from the lake and river into the Mekong. When the Mekong floods, the flow reverses: the floodwaters of the Mekong flow up the Tonle Sap.\n\n\nImmediately after the Sap River joins the Mekong by Phnom Penh, the Bassac River branches off the right (west) bank. The Bassac River is the first and main distributary of the Mekong. This is the beginning of the Mekong Delta. The two rivers, the Bassac to the west and the Mekong to the east, enter Vietnam shortly after this. In Vietnam, the Bassac is called the H\u1eadu River (S\u00f4ng H\u1eadu or H\u1eadu Giang); the main, eastern, branch of the Mekong is called the Ti\u1ec1n River or Ti\u1ec1n Giang. In Vietnam, distributaries of the eastern (main, Mekong) branch include the M\u1ef9 Tho River, the Ba Lai River, the H\u00e0m Lu\u00f4ng River, and the C\u1ed5 Chi\u00ean River.\n\n\n\n## Drainage basin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mekong River south of Chamdo.\n![](image)The Mekong from Phou si\n![](image)The confluence of the Mekong and the Nam Ou Rivers, Laos\nThe Mekong Basin can be divided into two parts: the \"upper Mekong basin\" in Tibet, and the \"lower Mekong basin\" from Yunnan downstream from China to the South China Sea.[14] From the point where it rises to its mouth, the most precipitous drop in the Mekong occurs in the upper Mekong basin, a stretch of some 2,200\u00a0km (1,400\u00a0mi). Here, it drops 4,500\u00a0m (14,800\u00a0ft) before it enters the lower basin where the borders of Thailand, Laos, China, and Myanmar come together in the Golden Triangle. Downstream from the Golden Triangle, the river flows for a further 2,600\u00a0km (1,600\u00a0mi) through Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia before entering the South China Sea via a complex delta system in Vietnam.[14]\n\n\n\n### Upper basin[edit]\n\n\nThe upper basin makes up 24% of the total area and contributes 15\u201320% of the water that flows into the Mekong River. The catchment here is steep and narrow with Soil erosion being a major problem and as a result of this, approximately 50% of the sediment in the river comes from the upper basin.\n\n\nIn Yunnan Province in China, the river and its tributaries are confined by narrow, deep gorges. The tributary river systems in this part of the basin are small. Only 14 have catchment areas that exceed 1,000\u00a0km2 (390\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), yet the greatest amount of loss of forest cover in the entire river system per square kilometer has occurred in this region due to heavy unchecked demand for natural resources. In the south of Yunnan, in Simao and Xishuangbanna Prefectures, the river changes as the valley opens out, the floodplain becomes wider, and the river becomes wider and slower.\n\n\n\n### Lower basin[edit]\n\n\nMajor tributary systems develop in the lower basin. These systems can be separated into two groups: tributaries that contribute to the major wet season flows, and tributaries that drain low relief regions of lower rainfall. The first group are left bank tributaries that drain the high rainfall areas of Laos. The second group are those on the right bank, mainly the Mun and Chi Rivers, that drain a large part of northeast Thailand.\n\n\nLaos lies almost entirely within the lower Mekong basin. Its climate, landscape and land use are the major factors shaping the hydrology of the river. The mountainous landscape means that only 16% of the country is farmed under lowland terrace or upland shifting cultivation.[14] With upland shifting agriculture (slash and burn), soils recover within 10 to 20 years but the vegetation does not. Shifting cultivation is common in the uplands of northern Laos and is reported to account for as much as 27% of the total land under rice cultivation.[14] As elsewhere in the basin, forest cover has been steadily reduced during the last three decades by shifting agriculture and permanent agriculture. The cumulative impacts of these activities on the river regime have not been measured. However, the hydrological impacts of land cover changes induced by the Vietnam War were quantified in two sub-catchments of the lower Mekong River basin.[15]\n\n\nLoss of forest cover in the Thai areas of the lower basin has been the highest of all the lower Mekong countries over the past 60 years. On the Khorat Plateau, which includes the Mun and Chi tributary systems, forest cover was reduced from 42% in 1961 to 13% in 1993.[14] Although this part of northeast Thailand has an annual rainfall of more than 1,000\u00a0mm, a high evaporation rate means it is classified as a semi-arid region. Consequently, although the Mun and Chi basins drain 15% of the entire Mekong basin, they only contribute 6% of the average annual flow.[14] Sandy and saline soils are the most common soil types, which makes much of the land unsuitable for wet rice cultivation. In spite of poor fertility, however, agriculture is intensive. Glutinous rice, maize, and cassava are the principal crops.[14] Drought is by far the major hydrological hazard in this region.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Floating homes on the Mekong, Cambodia\nAs the Mekong enters Cambodia, over 95% of its flows have already joined the river.[14] From here on downstream the terrain is flat and water levels rather than flow volumes determine the movement of water across the landscape. The seasonal cycle of changing water levels at Phnom Penh results in the unique \"flow reversal\" of water into and out of the Great Lake via the Tonle Sap River. Phnom Penh also marks the beginning of the delta system of the Mekong River. Here the mainstream begins to break up into an increasing number of branches.[14]\n\n\nIn Cambodia, wet rice is the main crop and is grown on the flood plains of the Tonle Sap, Mekong, and Bassac (the Mekong delta distributary known as the H\u1eadu in Vietnam) Rivers.[14] More than half of Cambodia remains covered with mixed evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest, but forest cover has decreased from 73% in 1973 to 63% in 1993.[14] Here, the river landscape is flat. Small changes in water level determine the direction of water movement, including the large-scale reversal of flow into and out of the Tonle Sap basin from the Mekong River.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mekong Delta, Vietnam\nThe Mekong Delta in Vietnam is farmed intensively and has little natural vegetation left. Forest cover is less than 10%. In the Central Highlands of Vietnam, forest cover was reduced from over 95% in the 1950s to around 50% in the mid-1990s.[14] Agricultural expansion and population pressure are the major reasons for land use and landscape change. Both drought and flood are common hazards in the Delta, which many people believe is the most sensitive to upstream hydrological change.[14]\n\n\n\n### Water flow along its course[edit]\n\n\n**Table 1: Country share of Mekong River Basin (MRB) and water flows**[14]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | China | Myanmar | Laos | Thailand | Cambodia | Vietnam | Total\n |\n| Basin area (km2) | 165,000 | 24,000 | 202,000 | 184,000 | 155,000 | 65,000 | 795,000\n |\n| Catchment as\u00a0% of MRB | 21 | 3 | 25 | 23 | 20 | 8 | 100\n |\n| Flow as\u00a0% of MRB | 16 | 2 | 35 | 18 | 18 | 11 | 100\n |\n\n\nBy taking into account hydrological regimes, physiography land use, and existing, planned and potential resource developments, the Mekong is divided into six distinct reaches:[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Mekong in Laos\n*Reach 1: Lancang Jiang or Upper Mekong River in China*. In this part of the river, the major source of water flowing into the river comes from melting snow on the Tibetan plateau. This volume of water is sometimes called the \"Yunnan component\" and plays an important role in the low-flow hydrology of the lower mainstream. Even as far downstream as Kratie, the Yunnan component makes up almost 30% of the average dry season flow. A major concern is that the ongoing and planned expansion of dams and reservoirs on the Mekong mainstream in Yunnan could have a significant effect on the low-flow regime of the lower Mekong basin system.[14][16][17]\n\n\n*Reach 2: Chiang Saen to Vientiane and Nong Khai*. This reach is almost entirely mountainous and covered with natural forest although there has been widespread slash and burn agriculture. Although this reach cannot be termed \"unspoiled\", the hydrological response is perhaps the most natural and undisturbed of all the lower basin. Many hydrological aspects of the lower basin start to change rapidly at the downstream boundary of this reach.[14]\n\n\nOn 19 July 2019 this reach of the river dropped to its lowest level in a century. Officials are particularly concerned as July is in the wet season, when mainstream flows are abundant historically. Locals are blaming low water on the newly constructed Xayaburi Dam, as it enters its test phase prior to the start of commercial operation in October 2019.[18]\n\n\n*Reach 3: Vientiane and Nong Khai to Pakse*. The boundary between Reach 2 and 3 is where the Mekong hydrology starts to change. Reach 2 is dominated in both wet and dry seasons by the Yunnan Component. Reach 3 is increasingly influenced by contributions from the large left bank tributaries in Laos, namely the Nam Ngum, Nam Theun, Nam Hinboun, Se Bang Fai, Se Bang Hieng and Se Done Rivers. The Mun-Chi river system from the right bank in Thailand enters the mainstream within this reach.[14]\n\n\n*Reach 4: Pakse to Kratie*. The main hydrological contributions to the mainstream in this reach come from the Se Kong, Se San, and Sre Pok catchments. Together, these rivers make up the largest hydrological sub-component of the lower basin. Over 25% of the mean annual flow volume to the mainstream at Kratie comes from these three river basins. They are the key element in the hydrology of this part of the system, especially to the Tonle Sap flow reversal.[14]\n\n\n*Reach 5: Kratie to Phnom Penh*. This reach includes the hydraulic complexities of the Cambodian floodplain, the Tonle Sap and the Great Lake. By this stage, over 95% of the total flow has entered the Mekong system. The focus turns from hydrology and water discharge to the assessment of water level, over- bank storage and flooding and the hydrodynamics that determine the timing, duration and volume of the seasonal flow reversal into and out of the Great Lake.[14]\n\n\n*Reach 6: Phnom Penh to the South China Sea*. Here the mainstream divides into a complex and increasingly controlled and artificial system of branches and canals. Key features of flow behaviour are tidal influences and salt water intrusion. Every year, 35\u201350% of this reach is flooded during the rainy season. The impact of road embankments and similar infrastructure developments on the movement of this flood water is an increasingly important consequence of development.[14]\n\n\nTable 2 summarises the mean annual flows along the mainstream. The mean annual flow entering the lower Mekong from China is equivalent to a relatively modest 450\u00a0mm depth of runoff. Downstream of Vientiane this increases to over 600\u00a0mm as the principal left bank tributaries enter the mainstream, mainly the Nam Ngum and Nam Theun. The flow level falls again, even with the right bank entry of the Mun-Chi system from Thailand. Although the Mun\u2013Chi basin drains 20% of the lower system, average annual runoff is only 250\u00a0mm. Runoff in the mainstream increases again with the entry from the left bank of the Se Kong from southern Laos and Se San and Sre Pok from Vietnam and Cambodia.\n\n\n\n![](image)Floating market, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1, Mekong delta\n![](image)C\u1ea7u kh\u1ec9 (monkey bridge) and small *n\u01b0\u1edbc m\u1eafm* (fish sauce) workshop on the bank of the Ti\u1ec1n River (branch of Mekong), Binh Dai District, Ben Tre Province, Vietnam\n![](image)Hamlet, Ti\u1ec1n River, Binh Dai District, Ben Tre Province, Vietnam\n**Table 2: Lower Mekong Mainstream annual flow (1960 to 2004) at selected sites.**[14]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mainstream site | Catchment area (km2) | Mean annual flow |  |  | as\u00a0% total Mekong\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | Discharge m3/s | Volume km3 | Runoff (mm) |  |\n| Chiang Saen | 189,000 | 2,700 | 85 | 450 | 19\n |\n| Luang Prabang | 268,000 | 3,900 | 123 | 460 | 27\n |\n| Chiang Khan | 292,000 | 4,200 | 133 | 460 | 29\n |\n| Vientiane | 299,000 | 4,400 | 139 | 460 | 30\n |\n| Nong Khai | 302,000 | 4,500 | 142 | 470 | 31\n |\n| Nakhon Phanom | 373,000 | 7,100 | 224 | 600 | 49\n |\n| Mukdahan | 391,000 | 7,600 | 240 | 610 | 52\n |\n| Pakse | 545,000 | 9,700 | 306 | 560 | 67\n |\n| Stung Treng | 635,000 | 13,100 | 413 | 650 | 90\n |\n| Krati\u00e9 | 646,000 | 13,200 | 416 | 640 | 91\n |\n| Basin Total | 760,000 | 14,500 | 457 | 600 | 100\n |\n\n\nFlows at Chiang Saen entering the lower basin from Yunnan make up about 15% of the wet season flow at Kratie. This rises to 40% during the dry season, even this far downstream. During the wet season, the proportion of average flow coming from Yunnan rapidly decreases downstream of Chiang Saen, from 70% to less than 20% at Kratie. The dry season contribution from Yunnan is much more significant. The major portion of the balance comes from Laos, which points to a major distinction in the low-flow hydrology of the river. One fraction comes from melting snow in China and Tibet and the rest from over-season catchment storage in the lower basin. This has implications for the occurrence of drought conditions. For example, if runoff from melting snow in any given year is very low, then flows upstream of Vientiane-Nong Khai would be lower.[14]\n\n\nIn a large river system like the Mekong, seasonal flows can be quite variable from year to year. Although the pattern of the annual hydrograph is fairly predictable, its magnitude is not. The average monthly flows along the mainstream are listed in Table 3, providing an indication of their range and variability from year to year. At Pakse, for example, flood season flows during August would exceed 20,000 cubic metres per second nine years out of ten, but exceed 34,000 m3/s only one year in ten.[14]\n\n\n**Table 3: Mekong Mainstream monthly discharge, 1960\u20132004 (m3/s).**[14]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Month | Chiang Saen | Luang Prabang | Vientiane | Nakhon Phanom | Mukdahan | Pakse | Kratie\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jan | 1,150 | 1,690 | 1,760 | 2,380 | 2,370 | 2,800 | 3,620\n |\n| Feb | 930 | 1,280 | 1,370 | 1,860 | 1,880 | 2,170 | 2,730\n |\n| Mar | 830 | 1,060 | 1,170 | 1,560 | 1,600 | 1,840 | 2,290\n |\n| Apr | 910 | 1,110 | 1,190 | 1,530 | 1,560 | 1,800 | 2,220\n |\n| May | 1,300 | 1,570 | 1,720 | 2,410 | 2,430 | 2,920 | 3,640\n |\n| Jun | 2,460 | 3,110 | 3,410 | 6,610 | 7,090 | 8,810 | 11,200\n |\n| Jul | 4,720 | 6,400 | 6,920 | 12,800 | 13,600 | 16,600 | 22,200\n |\n| Aug | 6,480 | 9,920 | 11,000 | 19,100 | 20,600 | 26,200 | 35,500\n |\n| Sep | 5,510 | 8,990 | 10,800 | 18,500 | 19,800 | 26,300 | 36,700\n |\n| Oct | 3,840 | 5,750 | 6,800 | 10,200 | 10,900 | 15,400 | 22,000\n |\n| Nov | 2,510 | 3,790 | 4,230 | 5,410 | 5,710 | 7,780 | 10,900\n |\n| Dec | 1,590 | 2,400 | 2,560 | 3,340 | 3,410 | 4,190 | 5,710\n |\n\n\nThere is little evidence from the last 45 years of data of any systematic changes in the hydrological regime of the Mekong.[14]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe internal drainage patterns of the Mekong are unusual when compared to those of other large rivers.[2] Most large river systems that drain the interiors of continents, such as the Amazon, Congo, and Mississippi, have relatively simple dendritic tributary networks that resemble a branching tree.[19]\n\n\nTypically, such patterns develop in basins with gentle slopes where the underlying geological structure is fairly homogeneous and stable, exerting little or no control on river morphology.[20] In marked contrast, the tributary networks of the Salween, Yangtze, and particularly the Mekong, are complex with different sub-basins often exhibiting different, and distinct, drainage patterns. These complex drainage systems have developed in a setting where the underlying geological structure is heterogeneous and active, and is the major factor controlling the course of rivers and the landscapes they carve out.[21]\n\n\nThe elevation of the Tibetan Plateau during the Tertiary period was an important factor in the genesis of the south-west monsoon,[22] which is the dominant climatic control influencing the hydrology of the Mekong Basin. Understanding the nature and timing of the elevation of Tibet (and the Central Highlands of Vietnam) therefore helps explain the provenance of sediment reaching the delta and the Tonle Sap Great Lake today. Studies of the provenance of sediments in the Mekong delta reveal a major switch in the source of sediments about eight million years ago (Ma).[23][24] From 36 to 8 Ma the bulk (76%) of the sediments deposited in the delta came from erosion of the bedrock in the Three Rivers Area. From 8 Ma to the present, however, the contribution from the Three Rivers Area fell to 40%, while that from the Central Highlands rose from 11 to 51%. One of the most striking conclusions of provenance studies is the small contribution of sediment from the other parts of the Mekong basin, notably the Khorat Plateau, the uplands of northern Laos and northern Thailand, and the mountain ranges south of the Three Rivers area.\n\n\nThe last glacial period came to an abrupt end about 19,000 years ago (19 ka) when sea levels rose rapidly, reaching a maximum of about 4.5 m above present levels in the early Holocene about 8 ka.[25] At this time the shoreline of the South China Sea almost reached Phnom Penh and cores recovered from near Angkor Borei contained sediments deposited under the influence of tides, and salt marsh and mangrove swamp deposits.[25] Sediments deposited in the Tonle Sap Great Lake about this time (7.9\u20137.3 ka) also show indications of marine influence, suggesting a connection to the South China Sea.[26] Although the hydraulic relationships between the Mekong and the Tonle Sap Great Lake systems during the Holocene are not well understood, it is clear that between 9,000 and 7,500 years ago the confluence of the Tonle Sap and the Mekong was in proximity to the South China Sea.\n\n\nThe present river morphology of the Mekong Delta developed over the last 6,000 years.[2] During this period, the delta advanced 200\u00a0km over the continental shelf of the South China Sea, covering an area of more than 62,500\u00a0km2. From 5.3 to 3.5 ka the delta advanced across a broad embayment formed between higher ground near the Cambodian border and uplands north of Ho Chi Minh City. During this phase of its development the delta was sheltered from the wave action of long-shore currents and was constructed largely through fluvial and tidal processes.[27] At this time the delta was advancing at a rate of 17\u201318 m per year. After 3.5 ka, however, the delta had built out beyond the embayment and became subject to wave action and marine currents. These deflected deposition south-eastwards in the direction of the C\u00e0 Mau Peninsula, which is one of the most recent features of the delta.\n\n\nFor much of its length the Mekong flows through bedrock channels, i.e., channels that are confined or constrained by bedrock or old alluvium in the bed and riverbanks.[2] Geomorphologic features normally associated with the alluvial stretches of mature rivers, such as meanders, oxbow lakes, cut-offs, and extensive floodplains are restricted to a short stretch of the mainstream around Vientiane and downstream of Kratie where the river develops alluvial channels that are free of control exerted by the underlying bedrock.\n\n\nThe Mekong basin is not normally considered a seismically active area as much of the basin is underlain by the relatively stable continental block. Nonetheless, the parts of the basin in northern Laos, northern Thailand, Myanmar and China do experience frequent earthquakes and tremors. The magnitude of these earthquakes rarely exceeds 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale and is unlikely to cause material damage.[28][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)19th century map showing the Mekong river as the \"Mei-Kong\" river\nThe difficulty of navigating the river has meant that it has divided, rather than united, the people who live near it. The earliest known settlements date to 210 BCE, with Ban Chiang being an excellent example of early Iron Age culture. The earliest recorded civilization was the 1st century Indianised-Khmer culture of Funan, in the Mekong delta. Excavations at Oc Eo, near modern An Giang, have found coins from as far away as the Roman Empire. This was succeeded by the Khmer culture Chenla state around the 5th century. The Khmer empire of Angkor was the last great Indianized state in the region. From around the time of the fall of the Khmer empire, the Mekong was the front line between the emergent states of Siam and Tonkin (North Vietnam), with Laos and Cambodia, then on the coast, torn between their influence.\n\n\nThe first European to encounter the Mekong was the Portuguese Ant\u00f3nio de Faria in 1540. A European map of 1563 depicts the river, although even by then little was known of the river upstream of the delta. European interest was sporadic: the Spanish and Portuguese mounted some missionary and trade expeditions, while the Dutch Gerrit van Wuysthoff led an expedition up the river as far as Vientiane in 1641\u201342.\n\n\nThe French invaded the region in the mid-19th century, capturing Saigon in 1861, and establishing a protectorate over Cambodia in 1863.\n\n\n\n![](image)Members of the Mekong expedition of 1866\u20131868\nThe first systematic European exploration began with the French Mekong Expedition led by Ernest Doudard de Lagr\u00e9e and Francis Garnier, which ascended the river from its mouth to Yunnan between 1866 and 1868. Their chief finding was that the Mekong had too many falls and rapids to ever be useful for navigation. The river's source was found by Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov in 1900.\n\n\nFrom 1893, the French extended their control of the river into Laos, establishing French Indochina by the first decade of the 20th century. This lasted until the First and Second Indochina Wars expelled French from its former colony and defeated US-supported governments.\n\n\nDuring the wars in Indochina in the 1970s, a significant quantity of explosives (sometimes, entire barges loaded with military ordnance) sank in the Cambodian section of the Mekong (as well as in the country's other waterways). Besides being a danger for fishermen, unexploded ordnance also creates problems for bridge and irrigation systems construction. As of 2013, Cambodian volunteers are being trained, with the support of the Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement within the US State Department Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, to conduct underwater explosive removal.[29]\n\n\nThe many maps of the river basin produced throughout recorded history reflect the region's changing human geography and politics.[30]\n\n\nIn 1995, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam established the Mekong River Commission (MRC) to manage and coordinate the use and care of the Mekong. In 1996 China and Myanmar became \"dialogue partners\" of the MRC and the six countries now work together in a cooperative framework. In 2000, the governments of China, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar signed a *Agreement on Commercial Navigation on Lancang-Mekong River among the Governments of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, the Union of Myanmar and the Kingdom of Thailand* which is the mechanism for cooperation with regard to riverine trade on the upper stretches of the Mekong.[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Natural history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Extirpated from most of its pan-Asian range, Cantor's giant softshell turtle can still be found along a stretch of the Mekong in Cambodia (Khmer called \"Kanteay\")\nThe Mekong basin is one of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world. Only the Amazon boasts a higher level of bio-diversity.[2] Biota estimates for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) include 20,000 plant species, 430 mammals, 1,200 birds, 800 reptiles and amphibians,[33] and an estimated 850 freshwater fish species (excluding euryhaline species mainly found in salt or brackish water, as well as introduced species).[34] The most species rich orders among the freshwater fish in the river basin are cypriniforms (377 species) and catfish (92 species).[35]\n\n\nNew species are regularly described from the Mekong. In 2009, 145 species previously unknown to science were described from the region, including 29 fish species, two bird species, 10 reptiles, five mammals, 96 plants, and six amphibians.[36] Between 1997 and 2015, an average of two new species per week were discovered in the region.[37] The Mekong Region contains 16 WWF Global 200 ecoregions, the greatest concentration of ecoregions in mainland Asia.[2]\n\n\nNo other river is home to so many species of very large fish.[38] The biggest include three species of *Probarbus* barbs, which can grow up to 1.5\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft) and weigh 70\u00a0kg (150\u00a0lb),[39] the giant freshwater stingray (*Himantura polylepis*, syn. *H. chaophraya*), which can reach at least 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) in length and 1.9\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) in width,[40] the giant pangasius (*Pangasius sanitwongsei*), giant barb (*Catlocarpio siamensis*) and the endemic Mekong giant catfish (*Pangasianodon gigas*). The last three can grow up to about 3\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) in length and weigh 300\u00a0kg (660\u00a0lb).[38] All of these have declined drastically because of dams, flood control, and overfishing.[38]\n\n\nOne species of freshwater dolphin, the Irrawaddy dolphin (*Orcaella brevirostris*), was once common in the whole of the lower Mekong but is now very rare, with only 85 individuals remaining.[41]\n\n\nAmong other wetland mammals that have been living in and around the river are the smooth-coated otter (*Lutra perspicillata*) and fishing cat (*Prionailurus viverrinus*).\n\n\nThe endangered Siamese crocodile (*Crocodylus siamensis*) occurs in small isolated pockets within the northern Cambodian and Laotian portions of the Mekong River. The saltwater crocodile (*Crocodylus porosus*) once ranged from the Mekong Delta up the river into Tonle Sap and beyond but is now extinct in the river, along with being extinct in all of Vietnam and possibly even Cambodia.\n\n\n\n### Protected areas[edit]\n\n\n* The headwaters of the Mekong in Zadoi County, Qinghai, China, are protected in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve. The name Sanjiangyuan means \"the sources of the Three Rivers\". The reserve also includes the headwaters of the Yellow River and the Yangtze.\n* The section of the river flowing through deep gorges in Yunnan Province is part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n* The Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve in Cambodia contains the largest lake in Southeast Asia. It is a UNESCO Biosphere reserve.\n\n\n![](image)Bank erosion on the Song Tien, a Mekong branch, Binh Dai District, Ben Tre Province, Vietnam.\n### Natural phenomena[edit]\n\n\nThe low tide level of the river in Cambodia is lower than the high tide level out at sea, and the flow of the Mekong inverts with the tides throughout its stretch in Vietnam and up to Phnom Penh. The very flat Mekong delta area in Vietnam is thus prone to flooding, especially in the provinces of An Giang and Dong Thap (\u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p), near the Cambodian border.\n\n\n\n## Fisheries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fish Farming on Mekong branch, Song Tien, \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province, Vietnam\nAquatic biodiversity in the Mekong River system is the second highest in the world after the Amazon.[42][43]\nThe Mekong boasts the most concentrated biodiversity per hectare of any river.[44] The largest recorded freshwater fish, a 300\u00a0kg giant freshwater stingray in 2022 and previously a 293\u00a0kg Mekong giant catfish in 2005, were both caught in the Mekong River.[45]\n\n\nThe commercially valuable fish species in the Mekong are generally divided between \"black fish\", which inhabit low oxygen, slow moving, shallow waters, and \"white fish\", which inhabit well oxygenated, fast moving, deeper waters.[46] People living within the Mekong River system generate many other sources of food and income from what are often termed \"other aquatic animals\" (OAAs) such as freshwater crabs, shrimp, snakes, turtles, and frogs.\n\n\nOAAs account for about 20% of the total Mekong catch.[2] When fisheries are discussed, catches are typically divided between the wild capture fishery (i.e., fish and other aquatic animals caught in their natural habitat), and aquaculture (fish reared under controlled conditions). Wild capture fisheries play the most important role in supporting livelihoods. Wild capture fisheries are largely open access fisheries, which poor rural people can access for food and income.\n\n\nBroadly, there are three types of fish habitats in the Mekong: i) the river, including all the main tributaries, rivers in the major flood zone, and the Tonle Sap, which altogether yield about 30% of wild catch landings; ii) rain-fed wetlands outside the river-floodplain zone, including mainly rice paddies in formerly forested areas and usually inundated to about 50\u00a0cm, yielding about 66% of wild catch landings; and iii) large water bodies outside the flood zone, including canals and reservoirs yielding about 4% of wild catch landings.[2]\n\n\nThe Mekong Basin has one of the world's largest and most productive inland fisheries.[42][47][48][49] An estimated two million tonnes of fish are landed a year, in addition to almost 500,000 tonnes of other aquatic animals.[50] Aquaculture yields about two million tonnes of fish a year.[46] Hence, the lower Mekong basin yields about 4.5 million tonnes of fish and aquatic products annually. The total economic value of the fishery is between US$3.9 and US$7 billion a year.[2] Wild capture fisheries alone have been valued at US$2 billion a year.[48] This value increases considerably when the multiplier effect is included, but estimates vary widely.\n\n\nAn estimated 2.56 million tonnes of inland fish and other aquatic animals are consumed in the lower Mekong every year.[46] Aquatic resources make up between 47 and 80% of animal protein in rural diets for people who live in the Lower Mekong Basin.[48][51][52] Fish are the cheapest source of animal protein in the region and any decline in the fishery is likely to significantly impact nutrition, especially among the poor.[42][51][53][54] Fish are the staple of the diet in Laos and Cambodia, with around 80% of the Cambodian population's annual protein intake coming from fish caught in the Mekong River system, with no alternative source to replace it. An MRC report claims that dam projects on the Mekong River will reduce aquatic life by 40% by 2020, and predicted that 80% of fish will be depleted by 2040. Thailand will be impacted, as its fish stocks in the Mekong will decline by 55%, Laos will be reduced by 50%, Cambodia by 35%, and Vietnam by 30%.[55]\n\n\nIt is estimated that 40 million rural people, more than two-thirds of the rural population in the lower Mekong basin, are engaged in the wild capture fishery.[2] Fisheries contribute significantly to a diversified livelihood strategy for many people, particularly the poor, who are highly dependent on the river and its resources for their livelihoods.[47][48][52] They provide a principal form of income for numerous people and act as a safety net and coping strategy in times of poor agricultural harvests or other difficulties.[47][48][52] In Laos alone, 71% of rural households (2.9 million people) rely on fisheries for either subsistence or additional cash income. Around the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia, more than 1.2 million people live in fishing communes and depend almost entirely on fishing for their livelihoods.[2]\n\n\n\n## Dams[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hydropower in the Mekong River Basin\n\nAs of at least 2016, the Mekong has the fastest-growing hydropower construction of any large river basin worldwide.[56] China built ten[57] or eleven[58] cascade dams on the Mekong mainstream between 1995 and mid-2019, leaving Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand without same amount of water as before investment.[59] As part of China's Great Western Development program, China's five large state-owned hydropower companies planned, underwrote, and built the majority of dams on the river and its tributaries.[60]:\u200a220\n\n\nThe Lao government has also prioritized hydropower development on the river and its tributaries, describing itself as the \"Battery of Asia.\"[60]:\u200a220\u2013221 Hydropower has brought in significant foreign exchange to Laos.[60]:\u200a221 Much of the Lao hydropower has been exported to Thailand, which in turn has benefited from Lao hydropower in developing its poorer areas, especially in Thailand's northeast.[60]:\u200a221\n\n\nThe Jinghong Dam, as of January 2020[update] the nearest Chinese dam upstream of the Thai border, has caused huge fluctuations in river levels, affecting people's livelihoods downstream by disrupting the river's natural cycle. It is impacting the ecosystem, disturbing the migratory patterns of fish as well as riverbank plants and local agriculture downstream.[61]\n\n\nDownstream countries Vietnam and Cambodia generate some hydropower, but primarily experience negative ecological and social effects of upstream hydropower development.[60]:\u200a221\n\n\n\n## Navigation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mekong ferry, Neak Loeung, Cambodia\n![](image)Slow cruise boats, Pakbeng, Laos\nFor thousands of years the Mekong River has been an important conduit for people and goods between the many towns on its banks. Traditional forms of trade in small boats linking communities continue today, however the river is also becoming an important link in international trade routes, connecting the six Mekong countries to each other, and also to the rest of the world.[2] The Mekong is still a wild river and navigation conditions vary greatly along its length. Broadly, navigation of the river is divided between upper and lower Mekong, with the \"upper\" part of the river defined as the stretch north of the Khone Falls in southern Laos and the \"lower\" part as the stretch below these falls.\n\n\nNarrower and more turbulent sections of water in the upstream parts of the Mekong River, coupled with large annual water level variations continue to present a challenge to navigation. The seasonal variations in water level directly affect trade in this section of the river. Volumes of trade being shipped decrease by more than 50%, primarily due to the reduced draughts available during the low water season (June\u2013January).[2] Despite these difficulties, the Mekong River is already an important link in the transit chain between Kunming and Bangkok with about 300,000 tonnes of goods shipped via this route each year.[2] The volume of this trade is expected to increase by 8\u201311% per year. Port infrastructure is being expanded to accommodate the expected growth in traffic, with new facilities planned for Chiang Saen port.[2]\n\n\nIn Laos, 50 and 100 DWT vessels are operated for regional trade. Cargos carried are timber, agricultural products, and construction materials.[2] Thailand imports a wide variety of products from China, including vegetables, fruit, agricultural products, and fertilisers. The main exports from Thailand are dried longan, fish oil, rubber products, and consumables. Nearly all the ships carrying cargo to and from Chiang Saen Port are 300 DWT Chinese flag vessels.[2]\n\n\nWaterborne trade in the lower Mekong countries of Vietnam and Cambodia has grown significantly, with trends in container traffic at Phnom Penh port and general cargo through Can Tho port both showing steady increases until 2009 when a decrease in cargo volumes can be attributed to the global financial crisis and a subsequent decline in demand for the export of garments to the US.[2] In 2009, Mekong trade received a significant boost with the opening of a new deep-water port at Cai Mep in Vietnam. This new port has generated a renewed focus on the Mekong River as a trade route. The Cai Mep container terminals can accommodate vessels with a draught of 15.2 m, equivalent to the largest container ships in the world. These mother vessels sail directly to Europe or the United States, which means that goods can be shipped internationally to and from Phnom Penh with only a single transshipment at Cai Mep.[2]\n\n\nAs an international river, a number of agreements exist between the countries that share the Mekong to enable trade and passage between them. The most important of these, which address the full length of the river, are:[2]\n\n\n\n* Agreement between China and Lao PDR on Freight and Passenger Transport along the Lancang\u2013Mekong River, adopted in November 1994.\n* Agreement on the Cooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin, Article 9, Freedom of Navigation, 5 April 1995, Chiang Rai.\n* Hanoi Agreement between Cambodia and Viet Nam on Waterway Transportation, 13 December 1998.\n* Agreement between and among the Governments of the Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam for Facilitation of Cross border Transport of Goods and People, (amended at Yangon, Myanmar), signed in Vientiane, 26 November 1999.\n* Agreement on Commercial Navigation on Lancang\u2013Mekong River among the governments of China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, adopted at Tachileik, 20 April 2000.\n* Phnom Penh Agreement between Cambodia and Vietnam on the Transit of Goods, 7 September 2000.\n* New Agreement on Waterway Transportation between Vietnam and Cambodia, signed in Phnom Penh, 17 December 2009.\n\n\nIn December 2016, the Thai cabinet of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha agreed \"in principle\" to a plan to dredge stretches of the Mekong and demolish rocky outcrops that are hindrances to easy navigation. The international Lancang-Mekong River navigation improvement plan for 2015\u20132025, conceived by China, Myanmar, Lao, and Thailand, aims to make the river more navigable for 500-tonne cargo vessels sailing the river from Yunnan to Luang Prabang, a distance of 890 kilometres.[62] China has been the driving force behind the demolition plan as it aims to expand trade in the area.[63] The plan is split into two phases. The first phase, from 2015 to 2020, involves a survey, a design, and an assessment of the environmental and social impacts of the project. These have to be approved by the four countries involved: China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand. The second phase (2020\u20132025) involves navigational improvements from Simao in China to 243 border posts in China and Myanmar, a distance of 259\u00a0km.[62] Local groups have countered that native inhabitants already operate their boats year-round and that the plan to blast the rapids is not about making life better for local people, but about enabling year-round traffic of large Chinese commercial boats.[64]\n\n\nOn 4 February 2020, the Thai Cabinet voted to stop the project to blast and dredge 97\u00a0km of the river bed after Beijing failed to stump up the money for further surveys of the affected area.[65]\n\n\n\n## Bridges[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of crossings of the Mekong River\n\n![](image)Kizuna Bridge cross Mekong at Kampong Cham\nConstruction of Myanmar\u2013Laos Friendship Bridge started on 19 February 2013.

The 1,170\u00a0m-long (3,840\u00a0ft) bridge opened on 8 April 1994. It has two 3.5\u00a0m-wide (11\u00a0ft) lanes with a single railway line in the middle. On 20 March 2004, the Thai and Lao governments agreed to extend the railway to Tha Nalaeng in Laos. This extension has since been completed.\n\n\nThe Second Thai\u2013Lao Friendship Bridge connects Mukdahan to Savannakhet. The two-lane, 12\u00a0m-wide (39\u00a0ft), 1,600\u00a0m-long (5,200\u00a0ft) bridge opened to the public on 9 January 2007.\n\n\nThe Third Thai\u2013Lao Friendship Bridge opened for traffic on 11 November 2011, connecting Nakhon Phanom Province (Thailand) and Thakhek (Laos), as part of Asian Highway 3. The Chinese and Thai governments agreed to build the bridge and share the estimated US$33 million cost.\n\n\nThe Fourth Thai\u2013Lao Friendship Bridge opened to traffic on 11 December 2013.[67] It links Chiang Rai Province, Thailand with Ban Houayxay, Laos.\n\n\nThere is one bridge over the Mekong entirely within Laos. Unlike the Friendship Bridges, it is not a border crossing. It is at Pakse in Champasak Province. It is 1,380\u00a0m (4,528\u00a0ft) long, and was completed in 2000. 15\u00b06\u203219.95\u2033N 105\u00b048\u203249.51\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff15.1055417\u00b0N 105.8137528\u00b0E\ufeff / 15.1055417; 105.8137528\ufeff (Pakxe)).\n\n\nThe Kizuna Bridge is in Cambodia, in the city of Kampong Cham, on the road linking Phnom Penh with the remote provinces of Ratanakiri and Mondolkiri, and Laos. The bridge opened for traffic on 11 December 2001.\n\n\nThe Prek Tamak Bridge, 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) north of Phnom Penh opened in 2010.\n\n\nPhnom Penh itself has no bridge under construction yet, although two new bridges have recently opened on the Tonle Sap, and the main bridge on the highway to Ho Chi Minh was duplicated in 2010.\n\n\nAnother new bridge was built at Neak Leung on the Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh Highway 1 with Japanese government assistance, and opened in 2015.\n\n\nIn Vietnam, since the year 2000 M\u1ef9 Thu\u1eadn Bridge crosses the first channel\u2014the left, main branch of the Mekong, the S\u00f4ng Ti\u1ec1n or Ti\u1ec1n Giang\u2014near V\u0129nh Long and since 2008 R\u1ea1ch Mi\u1ec5u Bridge crosses it near M\u1ef9 Tho, between the provinces of Ti\u1ec1n Giang and B\u1ebfn Tre.\n\n\nC\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 Bridge crosses the second channel\u2014the right, main distributary of the Mekong, the Bassac (Song Hau). Inaugurated in 2010, it is the longest main span cable-stayed bridge in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n## Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nDrought linked to a changing climate and dozens of hydroelectric dams are damaging the Mekong ecosystem.[68][69][70] When drought ends and the inevitable floods begin, the effects of Mekong dams on flood pulse dynamics over the entire Lower Mekong are poorly understood.[71]\n\n\nSewage treatment is rudimentary in towns and urban areas throughout much of the Mekong's length, such as Vientiane in Laos. Water pollution impacts the river's ecological integrity as a result.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMuch of the 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic present on earth[72] makes its way to the oceans. Ninety percent of plastic in the oceans is flushed there by just 10 rivers. The Mekong is one of them.[73]\n\n\nA growing number of academics, NGOs, and scientists have urged the international community and the Mekong River Commission to reduce the use of hydropower, giving concerns of long-term sustainability. Some of them have urged an immediate moratorium on new construction of hydropower projects and a shift to solar and other forms of renewable energy, which are becoming more competitive and faster to install.[74]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Rivers portal\n\n\n* Greater Mekong Subregion\n* Greater Mekong Sub-region Academic and Research Network\n* GMS Environment Operations Center\n* Indochina\n* Sekong River\n* Mekong River Basin Hydropower\n* Mekong River massacre 2011 killings on Mekong river\n* Stung Sen River\n* Mekong Expedition of 1866-1868\n* Fair river sharing\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** S.

The Lena is the eleventh-longest river in the world, and the longest river entirely within Russia, with a length of 4,294\u00a0km (2,668\u00a0mi) and a drainage basin of 2,490,000\u00a0km2 (960,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[6] Permafrost underlies most of the catchment, 77% of which is continuous.\n\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map including the lower course of the Lena\n![](image)Map including the upper reaches of the Lena\nOriginating at an elevation of 1,640 meters (5,381\u00a0ft) at its source in the Baikal Mountains south of the Central Siberian Plateau, 7 kilometres (4\u00a0mi) west of Lake Baikal, the Lena flows northeast across the Lena-Angara Plateau, being joined by the Kirenga, Vitim and Olyokma. From Yakutsk it enters the Central Yakutian Lowland and flows north until joined by its right-hand tributary the Aldan and its most important left-hand tributary, the Vilyuy. After that, it bends westward and northward, flowing between the Kharaulakh Range, part of the Verkhoyansk Range, in the east and the Chekanovsky Ridge in the west. Making its way nearly due north it expands into a large delta and ends in the Laptev Sea, a division of the Arctic Ocean, south-west of the New Siberian Islands. The Lena Delta is 30,000 square kilometres (12,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in area,[7] being traversed by seven main branches, the most important being the Bykovsky channel, farthest east.\n\n\n\n## Basin[edit]\n\n\nThe area of the Lena river basin is calculated at 2,490,000 square kilometres (960,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and the mean annual discharge is 489 cubic kilometers per year. Gold is washed out of the sands of the Vitim and the Olyokma, and mammoth tusks have been dug out of the delta. There are numerous lakes in the floodplain of the river. Lakes Nedzheli and Ulakhan-Kyuel are the largest in the basin of the Lena.\n\n\n\n### Tributaries[edit]\n\n\nThe Kirenga flows north between the upper Lena River and Lake Baikal. The Vitim drains the area northeast of Lake Baikal. The Olyokma flows north. The Amga makes a long curve southeast and parallel to the Lena and flows into the Aldan. The Aldan also curves roughly parallel to the Lena until it turns east and flows into the Lena north of Yakutsk. The Maya, a tributary of the Aldan, drains an area almost to the Sea of Okhotsk. The T-shaped Chona-Vilyuy system drains most of the area to the west.\n\n\nThe main tributaries of the Lena are, from source to mouth:\n\n\n\n* Tutura (right)\n* Ilga (left)\n* Kuta (left)\n* Tayura (right)\n* Kirenga (right)\n* Pilyuda (left)\n* Chechuy (right)\n* Ichera (left)\n* Chaya (right)\n* Chuya (right)\n* Vitim (right)\n* Peleduy (left)\n* Nyuya (left)\n* Derba (left)\n* Ura (left)\n* Bolshoy Patom (right)\n* Cherendey (left)\n* Biryuk (left)\n* Olyokma (right)\n\t+ Chara\n* Markha (left)\n* Markhachan (left)\n* Tuolba (right)\n* Sinyaya (left)\n* Buotama (right)\n* Menda (right)\n* Myla (right)\n* Tamma (right)\n* Lyutenge (right)\n* Suola (right)\n* Aldan (right)\n* Batamay (right)\n* Belyanka (right)\n\t+ Munni\n* Lyapiske (right)\n* Tympylykan (left)\n* Dyanyshka (right)\n* Tyugyuene (left)\n* Sitte (left)\n* Khanchaly (left)\n* Kenkeme (left)\n* Lungkha (left)\n* Namana (left)\n* Vilyuy (left)\n\t+ Chona\n* Linde (left)\n* Undyulyung (right)\n* Nuora (left)\n* Begidyan (right)\n* Khoruongka (left)\n* Sobolokh-Mayan (right)\n* Kyuelenke (left)\n* Muna (left)\n* Menkere (right)\n* Motorchuna (left)\n* Molodo (left)\n\t+ Syungyude\n* Natara (right)\n* Uel-Siktyakh (right)\n* Kuranakh-Siktyakh (right)\n* Byosyuke (right)\n* Tikyan (right)\n* Eyekit (left)\n* Bulkur (left)\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLena River from a source to Kachug\n |\n| --- |\n| Legend\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n |  | unnamed lake\n |\n| Tyrka |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  |  |\n| Uhta 2nd |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  |  |\n| Uhta 1st |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Pankukcha |\n| Shevukan |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  |  |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  |  |\n| Negnedai |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  |  |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Anai River |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Anai |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Alilei |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Chanchur River |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Chanchur |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  |  |\n| Kurungui |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Ilikta |\n| Kurungui River |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Maliy Tarel |\n| Birulka |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Ice bridge |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  |  |\n| Birulka River |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  |  |\n| Ushina |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Zhuya |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Bolshoi Kosogol |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Manzurka |\n| Khalsk |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | R 148\n |\n| Bolshiye Goly |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Iset R 148\n |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n |\n\n\nIt is commonly believed that the Lena derives its name from the original Even-Evenk name *Elyu-Ene*, which means \"the Large River\".\n\n\n\n![](image)The river around 1890\nAccording to folktales related a century later, in the years 1620\u20131623 a party of Russian fur hunters under the leadership of Demid Pyanda sailed up Nizhnyaya Tunguska, discovered the Lena, and either carried their boats there or built new ones. In 1623 Pyanda explored some 2,400 kilometres (1,500\u00a0mi) of the river from its upper reaches to the central Yakutia.[8] In 1628 Vasily Bugor and 10 men reached the Lena, collected 'yasak' (tribute) from the 'natives' and then founded Kirinsk in 1632. In 1631 the *voyevoda* of Yeniseysk sent Pyotr Beketov and 20 men to construct a fortress at Yakutsk (founded in 1632). From Yakutsk other expeditions spread out to the south and east. The Lena delta was reached in 1633.\n\n\nTwo of the three groups of survivors of the ill-fated Jeannette expedition reached Lena Delta in September, 1881. The one led by engineer George W. Melville was rescued by native Tungus huntsmen. Of the group led by Captain George W. De Long, only two of the men survived; the others died of starvation.\n\n\nBaron Eduard Von Toll, accompanied by Alexander von Bunge, led an expedition that explored the Lena delta and the islands of New Siberia on behalf of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences in 1885. In 1886 they investigated the New Siberian Islands and the Yana River and its tributaries. During one year and two days the expedition covered 25,000 kilometres (16,000\u00a0mi), of which 4,200 kilometres (2,600\u00a0mi) were up rivers, carrying out geodesic surveys en route.\n\n\nThe Lena massacre was the name given to the 1912 shooting-down of striking goldminers and local citizens who protested at the working conditions in the mine near Bodaybo in northern Irkutsk. The incident was reported in the Duma (parliament) by Kerensky and is credited with stimulating revolutionary feeling in Russia.\n\n\nVladimir Ilyich Ulyanov may have taken his alias, *Lenin*, from the river Lena, when he was exiled to the Central Siberian Plateau.\n\n\n\n## Delta[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lena River Delta in Autumn 2014\n![](image)Lena river Delta by Landsat, February 2000\nSee also: Fyodor Matisen\n\nAt the end of the Lena River there is a large delta that extends 100 kilometres (62\u00a0mi) into the Laptev Sea and is about 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) wide. The delta is frozen tundra for about seven months of the year, but in May the region is transformed into a lush wetland for a few months. Part of the area is protected as the Lena Delta Wildlife Reserve.\n\n\nThe Lena delta divides into a multitude of flat islands. The most important are (from west to east): Chychas Aryta, Petrushka, Sagastyr, Samakh Ary Diyete, Turkan Bel'keydere, Sasyllakh Ary, Kolkhoztakh Bel'keydere, Grigoriy Diyelyakh Bel'kee (Grigoriy Islands), Nerpa Uolun Aryta, Misha Bel'keydere, Atakhtay Bel'kedere, Arangastakh, Urdiuk Pastakh Bel'key, Agys Past' Aryta, Dallalakh Island, Otto Ary, Ullakhan Ary and Orto Ues Aryta.\n\n\nTurukannakh-Kumaga is a long and narrow island off the Lena delta's western shore.\n\n\nOne of the Lena delta islands, Ostrov Amerika-Kuba-Aryta or Ostrov Kuba-Aryta, was named after the island of Cuba during Soviet times. It is on the northern edge of the delta.[9]\n\n\n\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n\n* Alexander von Bunge & Eduard von Toll (1887), *The Expedition to the New Siberian Islands and the Yana country, equipped by the Imperial Academy of Sciences*.\n* Jeffrey Tayler (2006), *River of No Reprieve: Descending Siberia's Waterway of Exile, Death, and Destiny*\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lena Cheeks\n* Lena Pillars\n* Lena Plateau\n* List of rivers of Russia\n* List of longest undammed rivers\n* Tukulan\n* William Barr, writer of *The First Soviet Convoy to the Mouth of the Lena*.\n* ![](image) Siberia portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Stadnyk, Tricia A.; Tefs, A.; Broesky, M.; D\u00e9ry, S.

It is the chief tributary of the Ob and is also the longest tributary river in the world.\n\n\nThe river's source lies in the Mongolian Altai in Dzungaria (the northern part of Xinjiang, China) close to the border with Mongolia. \n\n\nThe Irtysh's main tributaries include the Tobol, Demyanka and the Ishim. The Ob-Irtysh system forms a major drainage basin in Asia, encompassing most of Western Siberia and the Altai Mountains.\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map including the lower reaches of the Irtysh River\n![](image)The Irtysh in Omsk\n![](image)The Irtysh near Pavlodar in Kazakhstan\nFrom its origins as the *Kara-Irtysh* (Vast Irtysh, kara means Vast in Turkic languages but also black. But in the context and geographic terms usually refers vast) in the Mongolian Altay mountains in Xinjiang, China, the Irtysh flows northwest through Lake Zaysan in Kazakhstan, meeting the Ishim and Tobol rivers before merging with the Ob near Khanty-Mansiysk in western Siberia, Russia after 4,248 kilometres (2,640\u00a0mi).\n\n\nThe name **Black Irtysh** (*Kara-Irtysh* in Kazakh, or *Cherny Irtysh* in Russian) is applied by some authors, especially in Russia and Kazakhstan, to the upper course of the river, from its source entering Lake Zaysan. The term **White Irtysh**, in opposition to the Black Irtysh, was occasionally used in the past to refer to the Irtysh below lake Zaysan;[3] now this usage is largely obsolete.\n\n\n\n### Main tributaries[edit]\n\n\nThe largest tributaries of the Irtysh are, from source to mouth:\n\n\n\n* Kelan (right)\n* Burqin (right)\n* Kalzhyr (right)\n* K\u00fcrshim (right)\n* Naryn (right)\n* Bukhtarma (right)\n* Ulba (right)\n* Uba (right)\n* Chagan (left)\n* Om (right)\n* Tara (right)\n* Uy (right)\n* Osha (left)\n* Shish (right)\n* Ishim (left)\n* Tobol (left)\n* Noska (left)\n* Demyanka (right)\n* Konda (left)\n\n## Economic use[edit]\n\n\nIn Kazakhstan and Russia, tankers, passenger and Cargo ships navigate the river during the ice-free season, between April and October. Omsk, home to the headquarters of the state-owned Irtysh River Shipping Company, functions as the largest river port in Western Siberia.\n\n\nOn the Kazakhstan section of the river there are presently three major hydroelectric plants, namely at Bukhtarma, Ust-Kamenogorsk and Shulbinsk. The world's deepest lock, with a drop of 42 metres (138\u00a0ft), allows river traffic to by-pass the dam at Ust-Kamenogorsk.[4] Plans exist for the construction of several more dams.\n\n\n\n![](image)Tobolsk river wharves in 1912\nThree dams have been constructed on the Chinese section of the Irtysh as well:\nthe Keketuohai (\u53ef\u53ef\u6258\u6d77) Dam (47\u00b010\u203251\u2033N 89\u00b042\u203235\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff47.18083\u00b0N 89.70972\u00b0E\ufeff / 47.18083; 89.70972),\nthe Kalasuke (\u5580\u814a\u5851\u514b) Dam (47\u00b008\u203214\u2033N 88\u00b053\u203215\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff47.13722\u00b0N 88.88750\u00b0E\ufeff / 47.13722; 88.88750),[5][6] and\nthe Project 635 Dam. There are also the Burqin Chonghu'er Dam and the Burqin Shankou Dam on the Irtysh's right tributary, the Burqin River and the Jilebulake Dam and Haba River Shankou Dam on another right tributary, the Haba River.\n\n\nThe Northern river reversal proposals, widely discussed by the USSR planners and scientists in the 1960s and 1970s, would send some of the Irtysh's (and possibly Ob's) water to the water-deficient regions of central Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Some versions of this project would have seen the direction of flow of the Irtysh reversed in its section between the mouth of the Tobol (at Tobolsk) and the confluence of the Irtysh with the Ob at Khanty-Mansiysk, thus creating an \"Anti-Irtysh\".[7]\nWhile these gigantic interbasin transfer schemes were not implemented, a smaller Irtysh\u2013Karaganda Canal was built between 1962 and 1974 to supply water to the dry Kazakh steppes and to one of the country's main industrial center, Karaganda. In 2002, pipelines were constructed to supply water from the canal to the Ishim and Kazakhstan's capital, Nur-Sultan.\n\n\nIn China, a short canal was constructed in 1987 (water intake at 47\u00b026\u203231\u2033N 87\u00b034\u203211\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff47.44194\u00b0N 87.56972\u00b0E\ufeff / 47.44194; 87.56972) to divert some of the Irtysh water to the endorrheic Lake Ulungur, whose level had been falling precipitously due to the increasing irrigation use of the lake's main affluent, the Ulungur River.[8] In the last years of the 20th century and the early 2000s, a much more major project, the Irtysh\u2013Karamay\u2013Ur\u00fcmqi Canal was completed. Increased water use in China has caused significant concerns among Kazakh and Russian environmentalists.[9][10]\nAccording to a report published by Kazakhstan fishery researchers in 2013, the total Irtysh water use in China is about 3 cubic kilometres (0.7\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) per year; as a result, only about 2/3 of what would be the river's \"natural\" flow (6\u00a0km3 out of 9\u00a0km3) reach the Kazakh border.[11]\n\n\n\n## Cities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An aerial view of the Irtysh in Omsk\nMajor cities along the Irtysh, from source to mouth, include:\n\n\n\n* in China: Fuyun, Beitun, Burqin\n* in Kazakhstan: Oskemen, Semey, Aksu, Pavlodar\n* in Russia: Omsk, Tara, Tobolsk, Khanty-Mansiysk\n\n\n## Bridges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sixty Years of Victory Bridge in Omsk. (The name commemorates the 60th anniversary of the V-E Day)\nSeven railway bridges span the Irtysh. They are located in the following cities:\n\n\n\n* About 15\u00a0km downstream from Serebryansk (on the dead-end branch line from Oskemen to Zyryanovsk)\n* Oskemen\n* Semey, on the Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway\n* Pavlodar, on the South Siberian rail line (Nur-Sultan to Barnaul)\n* near Cherlak, on the Middle Siberian rail line (\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c)\n* Omsk, on the Trans-Siberian Railway. Opened in 1896, this is the oldest bridge on the river.\n* Tobolsk, on the Tyumen-Surgut line\n\n\nAs the Kuytun\u2013Beitun Railway in China's Xinjiang is being extended toward Altay City, a railway bridge over the Irtysh at Beitun will need to be constructed as well.\n\n\nNumerous highway bridges over the Irtysh exist in China, Kazakhstan, and Russia.\n\n\nThe last bridge downstream on the Irtysh, a highway bridge opened in 2004, can be found at Khanty-Mansiysk, right before the river's confluence with Ob.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Irtysh River landscape in Burqin County, China\nA number of Mongol and Turkic peoples occupied the river banks for many centuries. In 657, Tang Dynasty general Su Dingfang defeated Ashina Helu, qaghan of the Western Turkic Khaganate, at the Battle of Irtysh River, ending the Tang campaign against the Western Turks.[12] Helu's defeat ended the Khaganate, strengthened Tang control of Xinjiang, and led to Tang suzerainty over the western Turks.[13]\n\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries the lower and middle courses of the Irtysh lay within the Tatar Khanate of Sibir; its capital, Qashliq (also known as Sibir) was located on the Irtysh a few kilometres upstream from the mouth of the Tobol (where today's Tobolsk is situated).\n\n\nThe Khanate of Sibir was conquered by the Russians in the 1580s. The Russians started building fortresses and towns next to the sites of former Tatar towns; one of the first Russian towns in Siberia (after Tyumen) was Tobolsk, founded in 1587 at the fall of the Tobol into the Irtysh, downstream from the former Qashliq.[14]\nFarther east, Tara was founded in 1594, roughly at the border of the taiga belt (to the north) and the steppe to the south.[15]\n\n\nIn the 17th century the Dzungar Khanate, formed by the Mongol Oirat people, became Russia's southern neighbor, and controlled the upper Irtysh.[16] As a result of Russia's confrontation with the Dzungars in the Peter the Great's era,[17] the Russians founded the cities of Omsk in 1716, Semipalatinsk in 1718, Ust-Kamenogorsk in 1720, and Petropavlovsk in 1752.\n\n\nThe Chinese Qing Empire conquered Dzungaria in the 1750s. This prompted an increase in the Russian authorities' attention to their borderland; in 1756, the Orenburg Governor Ivan Neplyuyev even proposed the annexation of the Lake Zaysan region, but this project was forestalled by Chinese successes.[18] Concerns were raised in Russia (1759) about the (theoretical) possibility of a Chinese fleet sailing from Lake Zaysan down the Irtysh and into Western Siberia. A Russian expedition visited Lake Zaysan in 1764, and concluded that such a riverine invasion would not be likely. Nonetheless, a chain of Russian pickets was established on the Bukhtarma River, north of Lake Zaysan.[19] Thus the border between the two empires in the Irtysh basin became roughly delineated, with a (sparse) chain of guard posts on both sides.\n\n\nThe situation in the borderlands in the mid-19th century is described in a report by A. Abramof (ru; 1865). Even though the Zaysan region was recognized by both parties as part of the Qing empire, it had been annually used, by fishing expeditions sent by the Siberian Cossack Host. The summer expeditions started in 1803, and in 1822\u201325 their range was expanded through the entire Lake Zaysan and to the mouth of the Black Irtysh. Through the mid-19th century, the Qing presence on the upper Irtysh was mostly limited to the annual visit of the Qing *amban* from Chuguchak to one of the Cossacks' fishing stations (*Batavski Piket*).[20]\n\n\nThe border between the Russian and the Qing empires in the Irtysh basin was established along the line fairly similar to China's modern border with Russia and Kazakhstan by the Convention of Peking of 1860.[21] The actual border line pursuant to the convention was drawn by the Protocol of Chuguchak (1864), leaving Lake Zaysan on the Russian side.[22][23] The Qing empire's military presence in the Irtysh basin crumbled during the 1862\u201377 Dungan Revolt. After the fall of the rebellion and the reconquest of Xinjiang by Zuo Zongtang, the border between the Russian and the Qing empires in the Irtysh basin was further slightly readjusted, in Russia's favor, by the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881).\n\n\n\n## Cultural references[edit]\n\n\nThe Irtysh River serves as a backdrop in the epilogue of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's 1866 novel *Crime and Punishment*.

The Yellow River's basin is often regarded as the birthplace of ancient Chinese civilization.[5][6]\n\n\nThe yellow sediments were carried downstream from the Loess Plateau.[7] There are frequent devastating floods and course changes produced by the continual elevation of the river bed, sometimes above the level of its surrounding farm fields.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe Yellow River (\u9ec3\u6cb3, *Hu\u00e1ng H\u00e9*, Beijing Mandarin: [xu\u032f\u0251\u014b\u02e7\u02e5 x\u0264\u02e7\u02e5] \u24d8) was not always yellow. When the river was still clear, it was simply referred to as \"the River\" (\u6cb3, Old Chinese: \\*g\u00e2i).[8] Observations made at Yumenkou indicated the river changed from clear to muddy sometime between 367 BC and AD 165, according to chronicles\u2019 records.[9] Alternative names \"Murky River\" (\u6fc1\u6cb3, Old Chinese: \\*dr\u00f4k-g\u00e2i)[8] and \"Yellow River\" (\u9ec3\u6cb3, Old Chinese: \\*gw\u00e2\u014b-g\u00e2i)[8] were attested in 145 BC[10][11] and in AD 429 respectively.[a] The name Yellow River edges out Murky River by the end of Tang dynasty, for unclear reasons.[b]\n\n\nIn the Shaanxi loess plateau, it is referred to as \"River, my lord/master\" in Jin Chinese language (\u8001\u723a\u6cb3, [lo\u02e6\u02e9\u02e8 i\u02e7 x\u0264u\u032f\u02e7]).[18][19]\n\n\nIn Mongolian, it is called *\u0160ar M\u00f6r\u00f6n* (\u0428\u0430\u0440 \u043c\u04e9\u0440\u04e9\u043d, \"Yellow River\")[20] or *Khatan Gol* (\u0425\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043d \u0433\u043e\u043b, \"Queen River\").\"[21] The river is mentioned in the Kul Tigin stele as the \"Green River\" (Old Turkic\u00a0: *ya\u0161\u00efl \u00fcg\u00fcz*, \ud803\udc16\ud803\udc41\ud803\udc1e\ud803\udc3d\ud803\udc3a\ud803\udc0d).[22]\n\n\nThe Tibetan name is \"River of the Peacock\" (Tibetan: \u0f62\u0fa8\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f74, Wylie: *rma.chu*, THL: *Ma Chu*; simplified Chinese: \u739b\u66f2; traditional Chinese: \u746a\u66f2; pinyin: *M\u01ce Q\u01d4*).\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of natural disasters by death toll\n\n### Yellow River Civilization[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yellow River civilization\n\n### Dynamics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*The Yellow River Breaches its Course* by Ma Yuan (1160\u20131225, Song dynasty). Flooding of the river has been the cause of millions of deaths.\nSee also: Yellow River floods\n\nThe Yellow River first formed between 56 million and 34 million years ago during the Eocene epoch,[7] while the familiar shape appeared around 7 thousand years ago.[7]\n\n\nThe river has long been critical to the development of northern China, and is regarded by scholars as one cradle of civilization. Flooding of the river has also caused much destruction, including multiple floods that have resulted in the deaths of over one million people. Among the deadliest were the 1332\u201333 flood during the Yuan dynasty, the 1887 flood during the Qing dynasty which killed anywhere from 900,000 to 2 million people, and a Republic of China era 1931 flood (part of a massive number of floods that year) that killed 1\u20134 million people.[23]\n\n\nThe cause of the floods is the large amount of fine-grained loess carried by the river from the Loess Plateau, which is continuously deposited along the bottom of its channel. The sedimentation causes natural dams to slowly accumulate. These subaqueous dams are unpredictable and generally undetectable. Eventually, the enormous amount of water needs to find a new way to the sea, forcing it to take the path of least resistance. When this happens, it bursts out across the flat North China Plain, sometimes taking a new channel and inundating most farmland, cities or towns in its path.\n\n\nThe traditional Chinese response of building higher and higher levees along the banks sometimes also contributed to the severity of the floods: When flood water did break through the levees, it could no longer drain back into the river bed as it would after a normal flood, as the river bed was sometimes now higher than the surrounding countryside. These changes could cause the river's mouth to shift as much as 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi), sometimes reaching the ocean to the north of Shandong Peninsula and sometimes to the south.[24]\n\n\nAnother historical source of devastating floods is the collapse of upstream ice dams in Inner Mongolia with an accompanying sudden release of vast quantities of impounded water. There have been 11 such major floods in the past century, each causing tremendous loss of life and property. Nowadays, explosives dropped from aircraft are used to break the ice dams before they become dangerous.[25]\n\n\nBefore modern dams appeared in China, the Yellow River used to be extremely prone to flooding. In the 2,540 years from 595 BC to 1946 AD, the Yellow River has been reckoned to have flooded 1,593 times, shifting its course 26 times noticeably and nine times severely.[26] These floods include some of the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded. Before modern disaster management, when floods occurred, some of the population might initially die from drowning and many more would suffer later from the ensuing famine and spread of diseases.[27]\n\n\n\n### Ancient times[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Yellow River as depicted in a Qing dynasty illustrated map (sections)\n![](image)Historical courses of the Yellow River\n![](image)Historical courses of the Yellow River\nIn Chinese mythology, the giant Kua Fu drained the Yellow River and the Wei River to quench his burning thirst as he pursued the Sun.[28] Historical documents from the Spring and Autumn period[29] and Qin dynasty[30] indicate that the Yellow River at that time flowed considerably north of its present course. These accounts show that after the river passed Luoyang, it flowed along the border between Shanxi and Henan Provinces, then continued along the border between Hebei and Shandong before emptying into Bohai Bay near present-day Tianjin. Another outlet followed essentially the present course.[26]\n\n\nThe river left these paths in 602 BC and shifted several hundred kilometers to the east.[29][31] Sabotage of dikes, canals, and reservoirs and deliberate flooding of rival states became a standard military tactic during the Warring States period.[32] As the Yellow River valley was the major entryway to the Guanzhong area and the state of Qin from the North China Plain, Qin heavily fortified the Hangu Pass; it saw numerous battles and was also an important chokepoint protecting the Han capitals of Chang'an and Luoyang. Major flooding in AD 11 is credited with the downfall of the short-lived Xin dynasty, and another flood in AD 70 returned the river north of Shandong on essentially its present course.[26]\n\n\n\n### Imperial times[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Yellow River and Huai surrounding Sizhou and the Ming Zuling in the *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries* edition of Pan Jixun's *Overview of River Maintenance*. By the time of the Qing-era edition, both had been entirely lost during the 1680 flood.\nFrom around the beginning of the 3rd century, the importance of the Hangu Pass was reduced, with the major fortifications and military bases moved upriver to Tongguan. In AD 923, the desperate Later Liang general Duan Ning again broke the dikes, flooding 1,000 square miles (2,600\u00a0km2) in a failed attempt to protect his realm's capital from the Later Tang. A similar proposal from the Song engineer Li Chun concerning flooding the lower reaches of the river to protect the central plains from the Khitai was overruled in 1020: the Chanyuan Treaty between the two states had expressly forbidden the Song from establishing new moats or changing river courses.[33]\n\n\nBreaches occurred regardless: one at Henglong in 1034 divided the course in three and repeatedly flooded the northern regions of Dezhou and Bozhou.[33] The Song worked for five years futilely attempting to restore the previous course\u00a0\u2013 using over 35,000 employees, 100,000 conscripts, and 220,000 tons of wood and bamboo in a single year[33]\u00a0\u2013 before abandoning the project in 1041. The more sluggish river then occasioned a breach at Shanghu that sent the main outlet north towards Tianjin in 1048[26]\n\n\nIn 1128, Song troops under the Kaifeng governor Du Chong (\u675c\u5145, *D\u00f9 Ch\u014dng*, d.\u00a01141) breached the southern dikes of the Yellow River in an effort to stop the advancing Jin army. The resulting major river avulsion allowed the Yellow to capture the Si and other tributaries of the Huai River.[34] For the first time in recorded history, the Yellow River shifted completely south of Shandong Peninsula and flowed into the Yellow Sea. By 1194, the mouth of the Huai had been blocked.[35] The buildup of silt deposits was such that even after the Yellow River later shifted its course, the Huai could no longer flow along its historic course, but instead, its water pools into Hongze Lake and then runs southward toward the Yangtze River.[36]\n\n\nA flood in 1344 returned the Yellow River south of Shandong. The Yuan dynasty was waning, and the emperor forced enormous teams to build new embankments for the river. The terrible conditions helped to fuel rebellions that led to the founding of the Ming dynasty.[24] The course changed again in 1391 when the river flooded from Kaifeng to Fengyang in Anhui. It was finally stabilized by the eunuch Li Xing during the public works projects following the 1494 flood.[37] The river flooded many times in the 16th century, including in 1526, 1534, 1558, and 1587. Each flood affected the river's lower course.[37]\n\n\nThe 1642 flood was man-made, caused by the attempt of the Ming governor of Kaifeng to use the river to destroy the peasant rebels under Li Zicheng who had been besieging the city for the past six months.[38] He directed his men to break the dikes in an attempt to flood the rebels, but destroyed his own city instead: the flood and the ensuing famine and plague are estimated to have killed 300,000 of the city's previous population of 378,000.[39] The once-prosperous city was nearly abandoned until its rebuilding under the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing dynasty.\n\n\nThe question of how aggressively flooding should be controlled, and whether it should be steered back to its original channels when it migrated, was a topic of controversy in the imperial court. Rival cliques made arguments based on budgetary, technical and strategic criteria. Geographer Charles Greer identifies two competing schools of thought on how to control the Yellow River. One, which he identifies as Confucian, advocated containing the river between higher levees, thus maximizing the amount of river basin land that could be cultivated. The other, which he associates with Taoism, favored lower levees separated by as much as 5-10 kilometers.[40] In one particular long-running debate during the 11th century reigns of the Renzong and Shenzong emperors, when the river repeatedly broke its levees and migrated north and west, officials battled over whether expensive measures should be taken to return the river to its former channels. The Shenzong emperor ultimately decreed that the river be allowed to remain in its new course.[41]\n\n\nTraditional flood control techniques made use of levees, revetments to absorb the energy of the water, overflow basins, drainage canals and polders.[42] Treatises on traditional flood control techniques were written by officials such as Pan Jixun,[43] who argued that joining branches of the river increased the water's power and this in turn increased its ability to flush sediment.[44] The difficult situation around the confluence of the Yellow River, the Huai, and the Grand Canal, however, still led to a major flood of the regional center Sizhou and Pan's dismissal from court. Subsequently, the river's 1680 flood entirely submerged Sizhou and the nearby Ming Zuling tombs beneath Hongze Lake for centuries until modern irrigation and flood control lowered the water level enough to permit their excavation and the tombs' restoration.\n\n\n\n### Recent times[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chinese Nationalist Army soldiers during the 1938 Yellow River flood.\nBetween 1851 and 1855,[26][35][37] the Yellow River returned to the north amid the floods that provoked the Nien and Taiping Rebellions. The 1887 flood has been estimated to have killed between 900,000 and 2 million people,[45] and is the second-worst natural disaster in history (excluding famines and epidemics). The Yellow River more or less adopted its present course during the 1897 flood.[35][46]\n\n\nThe 1931 flood killed an estimated 1,000,000 to 4,000,000,[45] and is the worst natural disaster recorded (excluding famines and epidemics).\n\n\nOn 9 June 1938, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Nationalist troops under Chiang Kai-shek broke the levees holding back the river near the village of Huayuankou in Henan, causing what has been called by Canadian historian, Diana Lary, a \"war-induced natural disaster\". The goal of the operation was to stop the advancing Japanese troops by following a strategy of \"using water as a substitute for soldiers\" (\u4ee5\u6c34\u4ee3\u5175 *yishui daibing*). The 1938 flood of an area covering 54,000\u00a0km2 (20,800\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) took some 500,000 to 900,000 Chinese lives, along with an unknown number of Japanese soldiers. The flood prevented the Japanese Army from taking Zhengzhou, on the southern bank of the Yellow River, but did not stop them from reaching their goal of capturing Wuhan, which was the temporary seat of the Chinese government and straddles the Yangtze River.[47]\n\n\nIn 1954, the People's Republic of China announced its General Plan to Fundamentally Control Yellow River Flood Disasters and Develop Yellow River Waterworks.[48]:\u200a111\u2013113 It sought to address both flooding risks and to convert rainfall-fed fields of the North China Plain to irrigated agriculture.[48]:\u200a114 Construction began in earnest in 1957.[48]:\u200a114\n\n\nFrom the 1970s to the 1990s, the dry-up trends accelerated, with the Yellow River failing to reach its mouth for an average of approximately 180 days per year in the 1990s.[48]:\u200a168 In 1997, the Yellow River did not reach the sea for 226 consecutive days.[48]:\u200a168\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Its total drainage area is about 795,000 square kilometers (307,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\n\n\nAccording to the China Exploration and Research Society,[49] the source of the Yellow River is at 34\u00b029\u203231\u2033N 96\u00b020\u203225\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff34.49194\u00b0N 96.34028\u00b0E\ufeff / 34.49194; 96.34028 in the Bayan Har Mountains near the eastern edge of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The source tributaries drain into Gyaring Lake and Ngoring Lake on the western edge of Golog Prefecture high in the Bayan Har Mountains of Qinghai. In the Zoige Basin along the boundary with Gansu, the Yellow River loops northwest and then northeast before turning south, creating the \"Ordos Loop\", and then flows generally eastward across the North China Plain to the Gulf of Bohai, draining a basin of 752,443 square kilometers (290,520\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) which nourishes 140 million people with drinking water and irrigation.[50]\n\n\nThe Yellow River passes through seven present-day provinces and two autonomous regions, namely (from west to east) Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong. Major cities along the present course of the Yellow River include (from west to east) Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Wuhai, Baotou, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Jinan. The current mouth of the Yellow River is located at Kenli County, Shandong.\n\n\nThe river is commonly divided into three stages. These are roughly the northeast of the mountainous Tibetan Plateau, the Ordos Loop and Loess Plateau, and the North China Plain.[51] However, different scholars have different opinions on how the three stages are divided.[*citation needed*] This article mainly adopts the division used by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission.[52]\n\n\nThe Yellow River derived sediments have been transported out of the Bohai Sea, all way to the North Yellow Sea and South Yellow Sea, and formed a Distal Depocenter around the Shandong Peninsula.[53]\n\n\n\n### Upper reaches[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

This segment has a total length of 3,472 kilometers (2,157\u00a0mi) and total basin area of 386,000 square kilometers (149,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), 51.4% of the total basin area. Along this length, the elevation of the Yellow River drops 3,496 meters (11,470\u00a0ft), with an average grade of 0.10%.\n\n\nThe source section flows mainly through pastures, swamps, and knolls between the Bayan Har Mountains, and the Anemaqen (Amne Machin) Mountains in Qinghai. The river water is clear and flows steadily. Crystal clear lakes are characteristic of this section. The two main lakes along this section are Lake Gyaring (Zhaling) and Lake Ngoring (Eling), with capacities of 4.7\u00a0billion and 10.8\u00a0billion m3 (166 and 381 billion ft3), respectively. At elevations over 4,290\u00a0m (14,070\u00a0ft) above sea level they are the two largest plateau freshwater lakes nationwide. A significant amount of land in the Yellow River's source area has been designated as the Sanjiangyuan (\"'Three Rivers' Sources\") National Nature Reserve, to protect the source region of the Yellow River, the Yangtze, and the Mekong.\n\n\nFlowing east at the eastern edge of the Amne Machin Mountains, the Yellow River enters Maqu County in Gansu. Here, the river skirts through the high-altitude peat bog known as the Zoig\u00ea Wetlands and makes a sharp turn towards the northwest forming the border between Maqu and Zoig\u00ea County in Sichuan. Flowing now along the northern edge of Amne Machin, the river reenters Qinghai and gradually curves north towards the Longyang Gorge at Xinghai.\n\n\nThe valley section stretches from Longyang Gorge in Qinghai to Qingtong Gorge in Gansu. Steep cliffs line both sides of the river. The water bed is narrow and the average drop is large, so the flow in this section is extremely turbulent and fast. There are 20 gorges in this section, the most famous of these being the Longyang, Jishi, Liujia, Bapan, and Qingtong gorges. The flow conditions in this section makes it the best location for hydroelectric plants. The Yellow River exits Qinghai for the second and final time in these gorges and enters Gansu for the second time just before Liujia Gorge. Downstream from the Yanguo Gorge, the provincial capital of Lanzhou is built upon the Yellow River's banks. The Yellow River flows northeasterly out of Gansu and into Ningxia before the Qingtong Gorge.\n\n\nAfter emerging from the Qingtong Gorge, the river comes into a section of vast alluvial plains, the Yinchuan Plain and Hetao Plain. In this section, the regions along the river are mostly deserts and grasslands, with very few tributaries. The flow is slow. The Hetao Plain has a length of 900\u00a0km (560\u00a0mi) and width of 30 to 50\u00a0km (19 to 31\u00a0mi). It is historically the most important irrigation plain along the Yellow River.\n\n\n\n### Middle reaches[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ordos Loop and Hetao\n\n![](image)At Lanzhou, Gansu\n![](image)At Shapotou, Ningxia\n![](image)Qiankun bend in Yonghe County\n![](image)At Luoyang, Henan\nThe Ordos Loop formed by an enormous twist of the Yellow River, beginning at Zhongning County in Ningxia and ending with a drastic eastward turn at its confluence with the Wei at Tongguan in Shaanxi. However, the official division for the middle reaches of the river run from Hekou in Togtoh County, Inner Mongolia, to Zhengzhou, Henan. The middle reaches are 1,206\u00a0km (749\u00a0mi) long, with a basin area of 344,000 square kilometers (133,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), 45.7% of the total, with a total elevation drop of 890\u00a0m (2,920\u00a0ft), an average drop of 0.074%. There are 30 large tributaries along the middle reaches, and the water flow is increased by 43.5% on this stage. The middle reaches contribute 92% of the river's silts.\n\n\nThe middle stream of the Yellow River passes through the Loess Plateau, where substantial erosion takes place. The large amount of mud and sand discharged into the river makes the Yellow River the most sediment-laden river in the world. The highest recorded annual level of silts discharged into the Yellow River is 3.91\u00a0billion tons in 1933. The highest silt concentration level was recorded in 1977 at 920\u00a0kg/m3 (57.4\u00a0lb/ft3). These sediments later deposit in the slower lower reaches of the river, elevating the river bed and creating the famous \"river above ground\". From Hekou to Yumenkou, the river passes through the longest series of continuous valleys on its main course, collectively called the Jinshan Valley. The abundant hydrodynamic resources stored in this section make it the second most suitable area to build hydroelectric power plants. The famous Hukou Waterfall is in the lower part of this valley on the border of Shanxi and Shaanxi.\n\n\n\n### Lower reaches[edit]\n\n\nIn the lower reaches, from Zhengzhou, Henan to its mouth, a distance of 786\u00a0km (488\u00a0mi), the river is confined to a levee-lined course as it flows to the northeast across the North China Plain before emptying into the Bohai Sea. The basin area in this stage is only 23,000 square kilometers (8,900\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), a mere 3% of the total, because few tributaries add to the flow in this stage; nearly all rivers to the south drain into the Huai River, whereas those to the north drain into the Hai River. The Huai River Basin, for example, is separated from the Yellow River Basin by the south dike of the Yellow River.[54] The total drop in elevation of the lower reaches is 93.6\u00a0m (307\u00a0ft), with an average grade of 0.012%.\n\n\nThe silts received from the middle reaches form sediments here, elevating the river bed. Excessive sediment deposits have raised the riverbed several meters above the surrounding ground. That is why this part of the river is called the 'Earth Suspended River'. At Kaifeng, Henan, the Yellow River is 10 meters (33\u00a0ft) above the ground level.[55]\n\n\n\n### Tributaries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The mouth of the Daxia River (coming from bottom right), flowing into the Yellow River's Liujiaxia Reservoir in Linxia Prefecture, Gansu\nTributaries of the Yellow River listed from its source to its mouth include:\n\n\n\n* White River\n* Daxia River\n* Tao River\n* Huang Shui\n\t+ Datong River\n* Zhuanglang River\n* Zuli River\n* Qingshui River\n* Dahei River\n* Kuye River\n* Wuding River\n* Fen River\n* Wei River (the Wei River is the largest of these tributaries)\n* Luo River\n* Qin River\n* Dawen River\n\n\nThe lower reaches of the Yellow River have no tributaries.[48]:\u200a168\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

If it is running to the sea with sufficient volume, 1.4 billion tons are carried to the sea per year.[*citation needed*] One estimate gives 34 kilograms of silt per cubic meter as opposed to 10 for the Colorado and 1 for the Nile.[26]\n\n\nIts average discharge is said to be 2,110 cubic meters per second (32,000 for the Yangtze), with a maximum of 25,000 and minimum of 245. However, since 1972, it often runs dry before it reaches the sea. The low volume is due to increased agricultural irrigation, increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river as of 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated 74,000\u00a0km2 (48,572\u00a0mi2) of land.[50] The Yellow River delta totals 8,000 square kilometers (3,090\u00a0mi2). However, with the decrease in silt reaching the sea, it has been reported to be shrinking slightly each year since 1996 through erosion.[56]\n\n\nThe highest volume occurs during the rainy season from July to October, when 60% of the annual volume of the river flows. Maximum demand for irrigation is needed between March and June. In order to capture excess water for use when needed and for flood control and electricity generation, several dams have been built, but their expected life is limited due to the high silt load. A proposed South\u2013North Water Transfer Project involves several schemes to divert water from the Yangtze River: one in the western headwaters of the rivers where they are closest to one another, another from the upper reaches of the Han River, and a third using the route of the old Grand Canal.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDue to its heavy load of silt the Yellow River is a depositing stream\u00a0\u2013 that is, it deposits part of its carried burden of soil in its bed in stretches where it is flowing slowly. These deposits elevate the riverbed which flows between natural levees in its lower reaches. Should a flood occur, the river may break out of the levees into the surrounding lower flood plain and take\na new channel. Historically this has occurred about once every hundred years. In modern times, considerable effort has been made to strengthen levees and control floods.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Hydroelectric power dams[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Liujiaxia Dam, Gansu\n![](image)Sanmenxia Dam, Henan\nBelow is the list of hydroelectric power stations built on the Yellow River, arranged according to the first year of operation (in brackets):\n\n\n\n* Sanmenxia Dam (1960; Sanmenxia, Henan)\n* Sanshenggong Dam (1966)\n* Qingtong Gorge hydroelectric power station (1968; Qingtongxia, Ningxia)\n* Liujiaxia Dam (Liujia Gorge) (1974; Yongjing County, Gansu)\n* Lijiaxia Dam (1997) (Jainca County, Qinghai)\n* Yanguoxia Dam (Yanguo Gorge) hydroelectric power station (1975; Yongjing County, Gansu)\n* Tianqiao Dam (1977)\n* Bapanxia Dam (Bapan Gorge) (1980; Xigu District, Lanzhou, Gansu)\n* Longyangxia Dam (1992; Gonghe County, Qinghai)\n* Da Gorge hydroelectric power station (1998)\n* Li Gorge hydroelectric power station (1999)\n* Wanjiazhai Dam (1999; Pianguan County, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia)\n* Xiaolangdi Dam (2001) (Jiyuan, Henan)\n* Laxiwa Dam (2010) (Guide County, Qinghai)\n* Yangqu Dam (2016) (Xinghai County, Qinghai)\n* Maerdang Dam (2018) (Maq\u00ean County, Qinghai)\n\n\nAs reported in 2000, the 7 largest hydro power plants (Longyangxia, Lijiaxia, Liujiaxia, Yanguoxia, Bapanxia, Daxia and Qinglongxia) had the total installed capacity of 5,618 MW.[57]\n\n\n\n## Crossings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Major cities along the Yellow River\n![](image)Pontoon bridge (Luokou Pontoon Bridge simplified Chinese: \u6d1b\u53e3\u6d6e\u6865; traditional Chinese: \u6d1b\u53e3\u6d6e\u6a4b; pinyin: *Lu\u00f2k\u01d2u F\u00faqi\u00e1o*) over the Yellow River in Jinan, Shandong\nThe main bridges and ferries by the province names in the order of downstream to upstream are:[*citation needed*]\n\n\nShandong\n\n\n\n* Dongying Yellow River Bridge\n* Shengli Yellow River Bridge (Dongying)\n* Lijin Yellow River Bridge (Dongying)\n* Binzhou Yellow River Road-Railway Bridge\n* Binzhou Yellow River Highway Bridge\n* Binzhou\u2013Laiwu Expressway Binzhou Yellow River Bridge (Binzhou\u2013Zibo)\n* Huiqing Yellow River Bridge (Binzhou\u2013Zibo)\n* Jiyang Yellow River Bridge (Jinan)\n* G20 Qingdao\u2013Yinchuan Expressway Jinan Yellow River Bridge (Jinan)\n* Jinan Yellow River Bridge\n* Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge (Jinan)\n* Jinan Jianbang Yellow River Bridge\n* Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-speed Railway Jinan Yellow River Bridge (Jinan\u2013Dezhou)\n* Beijing\u2013Taipei Expressway Jinan Yellow River Bridge (Jinan\u2013Dezhou)\n* Beijing\u2013Shanghai Railway Jinan Yellow River New Bridge (Jinan\u2013Dezhou)\n* Pingyin Yellow River Bridge (Jinan-Liaocheng)\n\n\nShandong\u2013Henan\n\n\n\n* Beijing\u2013Kowloon Railway Sunkou Yellow River Bridge (Jining\u2013Puyang)\n* Juancheng Yellow River Highway Bridge (Heze\u2013Puyang)\n* Dongming Yellow River Highway Bridge (Heze\u2013Puyang)\n\n\nHenan\n\n\n\n* Kaifeng Yellow River Bridge (Kaifeng)\n* Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge (Zhengzhou)\n\n\nShanxi\u2013Henan\n\n\n\n* Sanmen Yellow River Bridge (Sanmenxia)\n\n\nShaanxi\u2013Henan\n\n\n\n* Hancheng Yumenkou Yellow River Bridge\n\n\nNingxia\n\n\n\n* Yinchuan Yellow River Bridge (Yinchuan)\n\n\nInner Mongolia\n\n\n\n* Baotou Yellow River Bridge (Baotou)\n\n\nGansu\n\n\n\n* Lanzhou Yellow River Bridge\n* Zhongshan Bridge (Lanzhou)\n\n\nQinghai\n\n\n\n* Dari Yellow River Bridge\n\n\n## Fauna[edit]\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The paradise fish is well known in the aquarium hobby and it originates from East Asian river basins, including the Yellow River\nThe Yellow River basin is rich in fish, being the home of more than 160 native species in 92 genera and 28 families, including 19 species found nowhere else in the world (endemic).[58][51] However, due to habitat loss, pollution, introduced species and overfishing many of the natives have declined or disappeared entirely; several are recognized as threatened on China's Red List.[58][59] Dams and their reservoirs have increased the habitat for species of slow-moving and static waters, while it excluded species of flowing waters and prevented the up- and down-stream breeding migration of others.[58][59] In the 2000s, only 80 native fish in 63 genera and 18 families were recorded in the Yellow River basin.[58] In contrast, introduced fish have risen in both abundance and number of species; only one introduced fish species was recorded in the 1960s when ichthyologist Li Sizhong published his original survey of fish fauna of the region, but by the 2000s there were 26.[58]\n\n\nAs typical of Asian rivers, Cyprinidae is by far the most diverse family in the Yellow River basin. More than 85 cyprinids have been recorded in this basin, including species that still are present and species that no longer are present. Other highly diverse families are the stone loaches (more than 20 species), gobies (c. 15 species), true loaches (c. 10 species) and bagrid catfish (c. 10 species).[58] Although there are species found throughout much of the river, several have a more restricted range. For example, the uppermost, highest parts on the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau has relatively few native species, notably snowtrout and allies (*Gymnocypris*, *Gymnodiptychus*, *Platypharodon* and *Schizopygopsis*), and *Triplophysa* loaches.[60] Of the 18 endemics in the Yellow River basin, 12 are (or were) found in the upper part.[58] These in particular have become threatened and the fish fauna in many headwaters are now dominated by introduced salmonids.[58][60] In contrast, the lowermost part of the river and its delta are home to many brackish water or euryhaline species, like gobies (although there are also true freshwater gobies in the Yellow River), Asian seabasses, flatfish and *Takifugu* pufferfish.[58]\n\n\nFishing remains an important activity, but catches have declined. In 2007, it was noted that 40% fewer fish were caught in the Yellow River compared to earlier catches.[59] Large cyprinids (Asian carp, predatory carp, Wuchang bream and Mongolian redfin) and large catfish (Amur and Lanzhou catfish) are still present, but the largest species, the Chinese paddlefish, kaluga sturgeon and Yangtze sturgeon, have not been reported from the Yellow River basin in about 50 years.[58][51][61] Other species that support important fisheries include white Amur bream, ayu, mandarin fish, *Protosalanx* icefish, northern snakehead, Asian swamp eel and others.[58]\n\n\nAnnual fishing ban has been implemented since 2018, covering the entire Yellow River basin from 1 April to 30 June each year.[62] A total ban of fishing of natural fishes is being implemented in the upper reaches of the Yellow River starting 1 April 2022, covering Qinghai, Sichuan and Gansu provinces, until the end of 2025. For the rest of the basin, the annual ban is extended to a period from 1 April to 31 July.[63]\n\n\n\n### Aquaculture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Chinese pond turtle (shown) and Chinese softshell turtle are both native to the Yellow River, but also farmed in large numbers\nThe Yellow River is generally less suitable for aquaculture than the rivers of central and southern China, such as the Yangtze or the Pearl River, but aquaculture is also practiced in some areas along the Yellow River. An important aquaculture area is the riverside plain in Xingyang City, upstream from Zhengzhou. Since the development of fish ponds started in Xingyang's riverside Wangcun Town in 1986, the pond systems in Wangcun have grown to the total size of 15,000 *mu* (10\u00a0km2), making the town the largest aquaculture center in North China.[64]\n\n\nTwo turtle species are native to the Yellow River basin: the Chinese pond turtle and Chinese softshell turtle.[65] Both species\u2014but especially the softshell\u2014are widely farmed for food.[66] A variety of the Chinese softshell turtle popular in Chinese gourmets is called the Yellow River turtle (\u9ec4\u6cb3\u9cd6). Nowadays most of the Yellow River turtles eaten in China's restaurants comes from turtle farms, which may or may not be near the Yellow River.\nIn 2007, construction started in Wangcun, Henan on a large farm for raising this turtle variety. With the capacity for raising 5 million turtles a year, the facility was expected to become Henan's largest farm of this kind.[67]\n\n\nThe huge, entirely aquatic Chinese giant salamander, a species that has declined drastically due primarily to persecution for food and traditional medicine, is native to the Yellow River and other Chinese rivers. It is farmed in large numbers in several parts of China and genetic studies have revealed that the captive stock mostly is of Yellow River origin. As these often are released back into the wild, the Yellow River type of the Chinese giant salamander has spread to other parts of China, which represents a problem to the other types.[68]\n\n\n\n## Pollution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Water pollution in China\n\nOn 25 November 2008, Tania Branigan of *The Guardian* filed a report \"China's Mother River: the Yellow River\", claiming that severe pollution has made one-third of China's Yellow River unusable even for agricultural or industrial use, due to factory discharges and sewage from fast-expanding cities.[69] After reaching the first major city, Xining, the river is heavily polluted.[70] The Yellow River Conservancy Commission had surveyed more than 8,384\u00a0mi (13,493\u00a0km) of the river in 2007 and said 33.8% of the river system registered worse than \"level five\" according to the criteria used by the UN Environment Program.[*dubious \u2013 discuss*] Level five is unfit for drinking, aquaculture, industrial use, or even agriculture. The report said waste and sewage discharged into the system last year totaled 4.29b tons. Industry and manufacturing made up 70% of the discharge into the river with households accounting for 23% and just over 6% coming from other sources.[*which?*]\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Qikou town along Yellow River in Shanxi Province\nIn ancient times, it was believed that the Yellow River flowed from Heaven as a continuation of the Milky Way. In a Chinese legend, Zhang Qian is said to have been commissioned to find the source of the Yellow River. After sailing up-river for many days, he saw a girl spinning and a cow herd. Upon asking the girl where he was, she presented him with her shuttle with instructions to show it to the astrologer Yan Junping (\u56b4\u541b\u5e73). When he returned, the astrologer recognized it as the shuttle of the Weaving Girl (Vega), and, moreover, said that at the time Zhang received the shuttle, he had seen a wandering star interpose itself between the Weaving Girl and the cow herd (Altair).[71]\n\n\nThe provinces of Hebei and Henan derive their names from the Yellow River. Their names mean, respectively, \"North of the River\" and \"South of the River\", although the border between them historically has never been stable, and currently the border between Hebei and Henan is not the Yellow River, but the Zhang River instead.\n\n\n\nMother river, China's Sorrow, and cradle of Chinese civilization.\nTraditionally, it is believed that the Chinese civilization originated in the Yellow River basin. The Chinese refer to the river as \"the Mother River\" and \"the cradle of the Chinese civilization\".\nDuring the long history of China, the Yellow River has been considered a blessing as well as a curse and has been nicknamed both \"China's Pride\" and \"China's Sorrow\".[72]\n\n\n\nRiver of disaster\nDespite Yellow River having a central role in the development of Chinese civilization on North China Plain, flooding and constant rerouting of the river have also caused many great disaster to population along the river for long, hence it is also known as a River of disaster (Chinese: \u707e\u96be\u6cb3), with the disaster brought by the River said as history of disaster in the development of Chinese civilization, and the management of Yellow River have been a great political trouble to various Chinese dynasties throughout the history since ancient time.[73][74]\n\n\n\nWhen the Yellow River flows clear\nSometimes the Yellow River is poetically called the \"Muddy Flow\" (\u6fc1\u6d41; \u6d4a\u6d41; *Zhu\u00f3 Li\u00fa*). The Chinese idiom \"when the Yellow River flows clear\" is used to refer to an event that will never happen and is similar to the English expression \"when pigs fly\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\"The Yellow River running clear\" was reported as a good omen during the reign of the Yongle Emperor, along with the appearance of such auspicious legendary beasts as *qilin* (an African giraffe brought to China by a Bengal embassy aboard Zheng He's ships in 1414) and *zouyu* (not positively identified) and other strange natural phenomena.[75]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Central Plain (China)\n* Geography of China\n* He Bo\n* List of rivers in China\n* North China Plain\n* North China University of Water Conservancy and Electric Power\n* Water resources of China\n* Yellow River Cantata\n* Yellow River floods\n* Yellow River Map\n* Yellow River Piano Concerto\n* Yellow Sea\n* Red River (disambiguation)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Clapp, Frederick G.

This misled some scholars to believe the annotation existed in the first edition in the 1st century.[12] Li (2004) and Hargett (2021) propose that the earliest attestation of the Yellow River is the line \u5c01\u7235\u4e4b\u8a93\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u4f7f**\u9ec3\u6cb3**\u5982\u5e36\uff0c\u6cf0\u5c71\u82e5\u53b2\u3002\u570b\u4ee5\u6c38\u5be7\uff0c\u7230\u53ca\u82d7\u88d4\u3002\u300din vol. 16 of *Han Shu*;[12][13] yet Qing philologist Wang Niansun stated that the letter \u9ec3 was a later interpolation and did not exist in the first edition in the 1st century.[14] Excluding these problematic attestations in *Han Shu*, the two earliest attestations cited by Li (2004) came in 429 and 488.[12] In 429,[15] Pei Songzhi mentioned Yellow River twice in the chapter of \u8881\u7d39\u50b3 (Yuan Shao's biography) in \u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u6ce8 (*Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms*), \"\u300a\u9b4f\u6c0f\u6625\u79cb\u300b\u8f09\u7d39\u6a84\u5dde\u90e1\u6587\u66f0\uff1a\u300c...\u9a01\u826f\u5f13\u52c1\u5f29\u4e4b\u52e2\uff0c\u5e76\u5dde\u8d8a\u592a\u884c\uff0c\u9752\u5dde\u6d89\u6fdf\u3001\u6f2f\uff0c\u5927\u8ecd\u6c4e**\u9ec3\u6cb3**\u4ee5\u89d2\u5176\u524d...\u300d\", and \"\u737b\u5e1d\u50b3\u66f0\uff1a\u7d39\u5c07\u6fdf\u6cb3\uff0c\u6cae\u6388(Ju Shou)\u8aeb\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u52dd\u8ca0\u8b8a\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4e0d\u8a73\u3002\u4eca\u5b9c\u7559\u5c6f\u5ef6\u6d25\uff0c\u5206\u5175\u5b98\u6e21\uff0c\u82e5\u5176\u514b\u7372\uff0c\u9084\u8fce\u4e0d\u665a\uff0c\u8a2d\u5176\u6709\u96e3\uff0c\u8846\u5f17\u53ef\u9084\u3002\u300d\u7d39\u5f17\u5f9e\u3002\u6388\u81e8\u6fdf\u6b4e\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u4e0a\u76c8\u5176\u5fd7\uff0c\u4e0b\u52d9\u5176\u529f\uff0c\u60a0\u60a0**\u9ec3\u6cb3**\uff0c\u543e\u5176\u53cd\u4e4e\uff1f\u300d\" In 488,[16] Shen Yue mentioned Yellow River in the chapter \u7d22\u865c, volume \u5377\u4e5d\u5341\u4e94\u5217\u50b3\u7b2c\u4e94\u5341\u4e94 of \u5b8b\u66f8 (*Book of Song*), \"\u4e8c\u5341\u4e5d\u5e74[\u5b8b\u5143\u5609\u4e8c\u5341\u4e5d\u5e74, \u516c\u5143452\u5e74]\uff0c\u592a\u7956\u66f4\u9063\u5f35\u6c38\u3001\u738b\u7384\u8b28\u53ca\u723d\u7b49\u5317\u4f10\uff0c\u9752\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\u5289\u8208\u7956\u5efa\u8b70\u4f10\u6cb3\u5317\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u300c...\u611a\u8b02\u5b9c\u9577\u9a45\u4e2d\u5c71\uff0c\u64da\u5176\u95dc\u8981\u3002\u5180\u5dde\u5df2\u5317\uff0c\u6c11\u4eba\u5c1a\u8c50\uff0c\u517c\u9ea5\u5df2\u5411\u719f\uff0c\u8cc7\u56e0\u70ba\u6613\u3002\u5411\u7fa9\u4e4b\u5f92\uff0c\u5fc5\u61c9\u97ff\u8d74\uff0c\u82e5\u4e2d\u5dde\u9707\u52d5\uff0c**\u9ec3\u6cb3**\u4ee5\u5357\uff0c\u81ea\u7576\u6d88\u6f70\u3002\u300d\".\n2. **^** Deng (2015) proposes that the name \"Yellow River\" was favoured by Tang dynasty literati because there was a folk-etymological connection between \u9ec3 (\"yellow\") and \u5ee3 (\"wide\"), \u6a6b (\"broad\"), \u9404 (\"large bell\") and \u6f62 (\"large cistern\").[9] However, Schuessler (2007) proposes cognacy between \u9ec3 (\"yellow\") and Burmese \u101d\u1004\u103a\u1038 (*wang:*, \u201cbright\u201d) and \u101d\u102b (*wa*, \u201cyellow\u201d); meanwhile he states that \u5ee3 (\"wide\")'s etymology is uncertain: he relates it either to Mizo **vang** \u201cto be large, extensive\u201d and **v\u00e2ng** \u201cbreadth, width, broad, wide\u201d, or to Tibetan: \u0f61\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f54, Wylie: *yangs pa*, or to Thai \u0e01\u0e27\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07 *kw\u00e2a\u014b* \u201cto be broad, wide\u201d (< \u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07 *w\u00e2a\u014b* \u201cto be free, at leisure; to be vacant, unoccupied\u201d). He also cites Baxter & Sagart (1998: 60)'s opinion on a possible relation between \u5ee3 and \u5bec *ku\u0101n* \u201cwide\u201d; and that \u5ee3 is perhaps related to root \\**wa* of \u6cc1 *ku\u00e0ng*.[17]\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nLook up ***Yellow River***, ***China's Sorrow***, ***Huang He***, ***Huang Ho***, or ***Hwang Ho*** in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Yellow River.\n\n* The DELIGHT Project, Delta Information System for Geoenvironmental and Human Habitat Transition\n* Listen to the *Yellow River Ballade* from the Yellow River Cantata\n* First raft descent Archived 17 April 2009 at the Wayback Machine of the Yellow River from its source in Qinghai to its mouth (1987)\n* Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Strategies in the Yellow River Basin \u2013 UNESCO report\n\n\nWorks from the National Central Library about the Yellow River\n* \"Illustrations of Guarding the Yellow River\". *wdl.org*.

simplified Chinese: \u957f\u6c5f; traditional Chinese: \u9577\u6c5f; pinyin: *Ch\u00e1ng Ji\u0101ng*; lit. 'long river') is the longest river in Eurasia, the third-longest in the world, and the longest in the world to flow entirely within one country. It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows 6,300\u00a0km (3,915\u00a0mi) in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea.[8] It is the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world. Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China, and is home to nearly one-third of the country's population.[9]\n\n\nThe Yangtze has played a major role in the history, culture, and economy of China. For thousands of years, the river has been used for water, irrigation, sanitation, transportation, industry, boundary-marking, and war. The prosperous Yangtze Delta generates as much as 20% of China's GDP. The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world that is in use.[10][11] In mid-2014, the Chinese government announced it was building a multi-tier transport network, comprising railways, roads and airports, to create a new economic belt alongside the river.[12]\n\n\nThe Yangtze flows through a wide array of ecosystems and is habitat to several endemic and threatened species including the Chinese alligator, the narrow-ridged finless porpoise, and also was the home of the now extinct Yangtze river dolphin (or *baiji*) and Chinese paddlefish, as well as the Yangtze sturgeon, which is extinct in the wild. In recent years, the river has suffered from industrial pollution, plastic pollution,[13] agricultural runoff, siltation, and loss of wetland and lakes, which exacerbates seasonal flooding. Some sections of the river are now protected as nature reserves. A stretch of the upstream Yangtze flowing through deep gorges in western Yunnan is part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n### Chinese[edit]\n\n\n*Ch\u00e1ng Ji\u0101ng* (\u957f\u6c5f; \u9577\u6c5f) or \"**Long River**\" is the official name for the Yangtze in Mandarin Chinese. However, the Chinese have given different names to the upstream sections of the river up to its confluence with the Min River at Yibin, Sichuan.[14][15] Jinsha River (\"Gold Sands River\") refers to the 2,308\u00a0km (1,434\u00a0mi) of the Yangtze from Yibin upstream to the confluence with the Batang River near Yushu in Qinghai, while the Tongtian River (\"River that leads to Heaven\") describes the 813\u00a0km (505\u00a0mi) section from Yushu up to the confluence of the Tuotuo River and the Dangqu River.\n\n\nIn Old Chinese, the Yangtze was simply called *Jiang/Kiang* \u6c5f,[16] a character of phono-semantic compound origin, combining the water radical \u6c35 with the homophone \u5de5 (now pronounced *g\u014dng*, but *\\*k\u02e4o\u014b* in Old Chinese[17]). *Kong* was probably a word in the Austroasiatic language of local peoples such as the Yue. Similar to *\\*krong* in Proto-Vietnamese and *krung* in Mon, all meaning \"river\", it is related to modern Vietnamese *s\u00f4ng* (river) and Khmer *krung* (city on riverside), whence Thai *krung* (\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07 capital city), not *k\u00f4ngkea* (water) which is from the Sanskrit root *g\u00e1\u1e45g\u0101*.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)The \"Great River\" (\u5927\u6c5f) with its entrance to the East China Sea marked as the \"Mouth of the Yangtze\" (\u63da\u5b50\u6c5f\u53e3) on the Jiangnan map in the 1754 *Provincial Atlas of the Qing Empire*\nBy the Han dynasty, *Ji\u0101ng* had come to mean *any* river in Chinese, and this river was distinguished as the \"Great River\" \u5927\u6c5f (*D\u00e0ji\u0101ng*). The epithet \u9577 (simplified version \u957f), means \"long\", was first formally applied to the river during the Six Dynasties period.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nVarious sections of the Yangtze have local names. From Yibin to Yichang, the river through Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality is also known as the *Chu\u0101n Ji\u0101ng* (\u5ddd\u6c5f) or \"Sichuan River.\" In Hubei, the river is also called the *J\u012bng Ji\u0101ng* (\u8346\u6c5f; \u834a\u6c5f) or the \"Jing River\" after Jingzhou, one of the Nine Provinces of ancient China. In Anhui, the river takes on the local name *W\u01cen Ji\u0101ng* after the shorthand name for Anhui, *w\u01cen* (\u7696). And *Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0 Ji\u0101ng* (\u63da\u5b50\u6c5f; \u626c\u5b50\u6c5f) or the \"Yangzi River\", from which the English name Yangtze is derived, is the local name for the Lower Yangtze in the region of Yangzhou. The name likely comes from an ancient ferry crossing called *Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0* or *Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0j\u012bn* (\u63da\u5b50 / \u63da\u5b50\u6d25).[19] Europeans who arrived in the Yangtze River Delta region applied this local name to the whole river.[14] The dividing site between upstream and midstream is considered to be at Yichang and that between midstream and downstream at Hukou (Jiujiang).[20]\n\n\n\n### English[edit]\n\n\n\nThe river was called **Quian** (\u6c5f) and **Quianshui** (\u6c5f\u6c34) by Marco Polo[21] and appeared on the earliest English maps as **Kian** or **Kiam**,[22][23] which derives from Cantonese, all recording dialects which preserved forms of the Middle Chinese pronunciation of \u6c5f as *K\u00e6wng*.[16] By the mid-19th century, these romanizations had standardized as **Kiang**; *Dajiang*, e.g., was rendered as \"Ta-Kiang.\" \"Keeang-Koo,\"[24] \"Kyang Kew,\"[25] \"Kian-ku,\"[26] and related names derived from mistaking the Chinese term for the mouth of the Yangtze (\u6c5f\u53e3, p\u00a0*Ji\u0101ngk\u01d2u*) as the name of the river itself.\n\n\nThe name **Blue River** began to be applied in the 18th century,[22] apparently owing to a former name of the Dam Chu[28] or Min[30] and to analogy with the Yellow River,[31][32] but it was frequently explained in early English references as a 'translation' of *Jiang*,[33][34] *Jiangkou*,[24] or *Yangzijiang*.[35] Very common in 18th- and 19th-century sources, the name fell out of favor due to growing awareness of its lack of *any* connection to the river's Chinese names[36][37] and to the irony of its application to such a muddy waterway.[37][38]\n\n\nMatteo Ricci's 1615 Latin account included descriptions of the \"Ian\u017fu\" and \"Ian\u017fuchian.\"[39] The posthumous account's translation of the name as **Fils de la Mer** (\"Son of the Ocean\")[39][40] shows that Ricci, who by the end of his life was fluent in literary Chinese, was introduced to it as the homophonic \u6d0b\u5b50\u6c5f rather than the usual \u63da\u5b50\u6c5f. Further, although railroads and the Shanghai concessions subsequently turned it into a backwater, **Yang**zhou was the lower river's principal port for much of the Qing dynasty, directing Liangjiang's important salt monopoly and connecting the Yangtze with the Grand Canal to Beijing. (That connection also made it one of the Yellow River's principal ports between the floods of 1344 and the 1850s, during which time the Yellow River ran well south of Shandong and discharged into the ocean a mere few hundred kilometers from the mouth of the Yangtze.[36][26])\n\n\nBy 1800, English cartographers such as Aaron Arrowsmith had adopted the French style of the name[41] as **Yang-tse** or **Yang-tse\u00a0Kiang**.[42] The British diplomat Thomas Wade emended this to **Yang-tzu Chiang** as part of his formerly popular romanization of Chinese, based on the Beijing dialect instead of Nanjing's and first published in 1867. The spellings **Yangtze** and **Yangtze\u00a0Kiang** was a compromise between the two methods adopted at the 1906 Imperial Postal Conference in Shanghai, which established postal romanization. Hanyu Pinyin was adopted by the PRC's First Congress in 1958, but it was not widely employed in English outside mainland China prior to the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and the PRC in 1979; since that time, the spelling **Yangzi** has also been used.\n\n\n\n### Tibetan[edit]\n\n\n\nThe source and upper reaches of the Yangtze are located in ethnic Tibetan areas of Qinghai.[43] In Tibetan, the Tuotuo headwaters are the *Machu* (Tibetan: \u0f62\u0fa8\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f74\u0f0b, Wylie: *rma-chu*, lit. \"Red Water\").

This source is found at 33\u00b025\u203244\u2033N 91\u00b010\u203257\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff33.42889\u00b0N 91.18250\u00b0E\ufeff / 33.42889; 91.18250 and while not the furthest source of the Yangtze, it is the highest source at 5,342\u00a0m (17,526\u00a0ft) above sea level. The true source of the Yangtze, hydrologically the longest river distance from the sea, is at Jari Hill at the head of the Dam Qu tributary, approximately 325\u00a0km (202\u00a0mi) southeast of Geladandong.[44] This source was only discovered in the late 20th century and lies in wetlands at 32\u00b036\u203214\u2033N 94\u00b030\u203244\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff32.60389\u00b0N 94.51222\u00b0E\ufeff / 32.60389; 94.51222 and 5,170\u00a0m (16,960\u00a0ft) above sea level just southeast of Chadan Township in Zadoi County, Yushu Prefecture, Qinghai.[45] As the historical spiritual source of the Yangtze, the Geladandong source is still commonly referred to as the source of the Yangtze since the discovery of the Jari Hill source.[44]\n\n\nThese tributaries join and the river then runs eastward through Qinghai (Tsinghai), turning southward down a deep valley at the border of Sichuan (Szechwan) and Tibet to reach Yunnan. In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above 5,000\u00a0m (16,000\u00a0ft) to less than 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). Thus, over the first 2,600\u00a0km (1,600\u00a0mi) of its length, the river has fallen more than 5,200\u00a0m (17,000\u00a0ft).[46]\n\n\nIt enters the basin of Sichuan at Yibin. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through Mount Wushan bordering Chongqing and Hubei to create the famous Three Gorges. Eastward of the Three Gorges, Yichang is the first city on the Yangtze Plain.\n\n\nAfter entering Hubei province, the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes. The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake, which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At Wuhan, it receives its biggest tributary, the Han River, bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi.\n\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi province, Lake Poyang, the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai.\n\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.\n\n\nThe origin of the Yangtze River has been dated by some geologists to about 45\u00a0million years ago in the Eocene,[47] but this dating has been disputed.

Based on studies of sedimentation rates, however, it is unlikely that the present discharge site predates the late Miocene (c.\u200911 Ma).[51] Prior to this, its headwaters drained south into the Gulf of Tonkin along or near the course of the present Red River.[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Afternoon in the jagged mountains rising from the Yangtze River gorge\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Baiyue, state of Wu, state of Yue, state of Chu, Yangtze civilization, and Southward expansion of the Han Dynasty\n\nThe Yangtze River is important to the cultural origins of southern China and Japan.[53] Human activity has been verified in the Three Gorges area as far back as 27,000 years ago,[54] and by the 5th millennium\u00a0BC, the lower Yangtze was a major population center occupied by the Hemudu and Majiabang cultures, both among the earliest cultivators of rice. By the 3rd millennium\u00a0BC, the successor Liangzhu culture showed evidence of influence from the Longshan peoples of the North China Plain.[55] What is now thought of as Chinese culture developed along the more fertile Yellow River basin; the \"Yue\" people of the lower Yangtze possessed very different traditions \u2013 blackening their teeth, cutting their hair short, tattooing their bodies, and living in small settlements among bamboo groves[56] \u2013 and were considered barbarous by the northerners.\n\n\nThe Central Yangtze valley was home to sophisticated Neolithic cultures.[57] Later it became the earliest part of the Yangtze valley to be integrated into the North Chinese cultural sphere. (Northern Chinese were active there since the Bronze Age).[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)A map of the Warring States around 350 BC, showing the former coastline of the Yangtze delta\nIn the lower Yangtze, two Yue tribes, the *Gouwu* in southern Jiangsu and the *Yuyue* in northern Zhejiang, display increasing Zhou (i.e., North Chinese) influence starting in the 9th century\u00a0BC. Traditional accounts[59] credit these changes to northern refugees (Taibo and Zhongyong in Wu and Wuyi in Yue) who assumed power over the local tribes, though these are generally assumed to be myths invented to legitimate them to other Zhou rulers. As the kingdoms of Wu and Yue, they were famed as fishers, shipwrights, and sword-smiths. Adopting Chinese characters, political institutions, and military technology, they were among the most powerful states during the later Zhou. In the middle Yangtze, the state of Jing seems to have begun in the upper Han River valley a minor Zhou polity, but it adapted to native culture as it expanded south and east into the Yangtze valley. In the process, it changed its name to Chu.[60]\n\n\nWhether native or nativizing, the Yangtze states held their own against the northern Chinese homeland: some lists credit them with three of the Spring and Autumn period's Five Hegemons and one of the Warring States' Four Lords. They fell in against themselves, however. Chu's growing power led its rival Jin to support Wu as a counter. Wu successfully sacked Chu's capital Ying in 506\u00a0BC, but Chu subsequently supported Yue in its attacks against Wu's southern flank. In 473\u00a0BC, King Goujian of Yue fully annexed Wu and moved his court to its eponymous capital at modern Suzhou. In 333\u00a0BC, Chu finally united the lower Yangtze by annexing Yue, whose royal family was said to have fled south and established the Minyue kingdom in Fujian. Qin was able to unite China by first subduing Ba and Shu on the upper Yangtze in modern Sichuan, giving them a strong base to attack Chu's settlements along the river.\n\n\nThe state of Qin conquered the central Yangtze region, previous heartland of Chu, in 278 BC, and incorporated the region into its expanding empire. Qin then used its connections along the Yangtze River the Xiang River to expand China into Hunan, Jiangxi and Guangdong, setting up military commanderies along the main lines of communication. At the collapse of the Qin Dynasty, these southern commanderies became the independent Nanyue Empire under Zhao Tuo while Chu and Han vied with each other for control of the north.\n\n\nSince the Han dynasty, the region of the Yangtze River grew ever more important to China's economy. The establishment of irrigation systems (the most famous one is Dujiangyan, northwest of Chengdu, built during the Warring States period) made agriculture very stable and productive, eventually exceeding even the Yellow River region. The Qin and Han empires were actively engaged in the agricultural colonization of the Yangtze lowlands, maintaining a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods.[61] By the Song dynasty, the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country, especially in the lower reaches of the river. Early in the Qing dynasty, the region called Jiangnan (that includes the southern part of Jiangsu, the northern part of Zhejiang, and the southeastern part of Anhui) provided 1\u20443\u20131\u20442 of the nation's revenues.\n\n\nThe Yangtze has long been the backbone of China's inland water transportation system, which remained particularly important for almost two thousand years, until the construction of the national railway network during the 20th century. The Grand Canal connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the Jiangnan region south of the river (Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou) and with northern China (all the way from Yangzhou to Beijing). The less well known ancient Lingqu Canal, connecting the upper Xiang River with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the Pearl River Delta.[62]\n\n\nHistorically, the Yangtze became the political boundary between north China and south China several times (see History of China) because of the difficulty of crossing the river. This occurred notably during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and the Southern Song. Many battles took place along the river, the most famous being the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 AD during the Three Kingdoms period.\n\n\nThe Yangtze was the site of naval battles between the Song dynasty and Jurchen Jin during the Jin\u2013Song wars. In the Battle of Caishi of 1161, the ships of the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang clashed with the Song fleet on the Yangtze. Song soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulfur using trebuchets at the Jurchen warships. The battle was a Song victory that halted the invasion by the Jin.[63][64] The Battle of Tangdao was another Yangtze naval battle in the same year.\n\n\nPolitically, Nanjing was the capital of China several times, although most of the time its territory only covered the southeastern part of China, such as the Wu kingdom in the Three Kingdoms period, the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and during the Southern and Northern Dynasties and Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms periods. Only the Ming occupied most parts of China from their capital at Nanjing, though it later moved the capital to Beijing. The ROC capital was located in Nanjing in the periods 1911\u201312, 1927\u201337, and 1945\u201349.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n*Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River*, a Ming dynasty landscape painting\n\n### Age of steam[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China Station\n\nThe *Jardine*, the first steamship to sail the river, was built for Jardine, Matheson & Co. in 1835. This small vessel was to carry passengers and mail between Lintin Island, Macao, and Huangpu. However, the Chinese, draconian in their application of the rules relating to foreign vessels, were unhappy about a \"fire-ship\" steaming up the Canton River. The acting Viceroy of Liangguang issued an edict warning that she would be fired on if she attempted the trip.[65] On the *Jardine's* first trial run from Lintin Island the forts on both sides of the Bogue opened fire and she was forced to turn back. The Chinese authorities issued a further warning insisting that the ship leave Chinese waters. The *Jardine* in any case needed repairs and was sent to Singapore.[66]  \nSubsequently, Lord Palmerston, the Foreign Secretary decided mainly on the \"suggestions\" of William Jardine to declare war on China. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannonball fired at a British ship, the *Royal Saxon*, the British started the first of the Opium Wars. Royal Navy warships destroyed numerous shore batteries and Chinese warships, laying waste to several coastal forts along the way. Eventually, they pushed their way up north close enough to threaten the Imperial Palace in Beijing itself.[65]\n\n\nThe China Navigation Company was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in London, initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after, and in 1883 a regular service to Australia was initiated.[65]\n\n\n\nYangtze River steam boats filmed in 1937\n![](image)USS *Luzon*\n### Navigation on the upper river[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yangtze in 1915\n![](image)Cruise boats on Yangtze\n![](image)A vehicle carrier on Yangtze\n![](image)A container carrier on Yangtze\nSteamers came late to the upper river, the section stretching from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But summer was better navigationally and the three gorges, described as a \"150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass,\" posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 \u2013 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70\u201380 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver through some of the most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges.[67] Achibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the Chefoo Convention opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built *Kuling* but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties, competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their crafts caused by steamship wakes. *Kuling* was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service. In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade as long as it was restricted to native crafts. In 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade. Little took up residence in Chongqing and built *Leechuan*, to tackle the gorges in 1898. In March *Leechuan* completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers. *Leechuan* was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot.[68] In 1898, Little persuaded Captain Samuel Cornell Plant to come out to China to lend his expertise. Captain Plant had just completed navigation of Persia's Upper Karun River and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on *Leechuan* at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had SS *Pioneer* built with Plant in command. In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing. *Pioneer* was sold to Royal Navy after its first run due to threat from the Boxer Rebellion and renamed HMS *Kinsha*. Germany's steamship effort that same year on SS *Suixing* ended in catastrophe. On *Suixing's* maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze. In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing. Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS *Shutung* and SS *Shuhun*. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too. Plant was appointed by Chinese Maritime Customs Service as First Senior River Inspector in 1915. In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems. He also wrote *Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River*, a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction. Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze. Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield and Swire and Standard Oil added their own steamers on the river between 1917 and 1919. Between 1918 and 1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business.[69] *Shutung* was commandeered by warlords and *Shuhun* was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping.[70] In 1921, when Captain Plant died at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation. The largest shipping companies in service, Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil, Mackenzie & Co., Asiatic Petroleum, Robert Dollar, China Merchants S.N. Co. and British-American Tobacco Co., contributed alongside international friends and Chinese pilots. In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners. One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English. Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.[71][72]\n\n\nStandard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, which were collectively destroyed on December 12, 1937, when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.[73]\n\n\n\n### Navy ships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Imperial Japanese Navy armored cruiser *Izumo* in Shanghai in 1937. She sank riverboats on the Yangtze in 1941.\nSee also: USS Asheville (PG-21), Yangtze Patrol, and Yangtze Incident\n\n### Contemporary events[edit]\n\n\nChinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong took staged swims in the river in 1956 and 1966 at Wuhan in publicity stunts to demonstrate his health, also starting a swimming craze through party propaganda.[74][75]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Welsh adventurer Ash Dykes became the first person to complete the 4,000-mile (6,437\u00a0km) trek along the course of the river, walking for 352 days from its source to its mouth.[76]\n\n\n\n## Hydrology[edit]\n\n\n### Periodic floods[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of deadliest floods\n\nTens of millions of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes. The floods large enough to overflow the dikes have caused great distress to those who live and farm there. Floods of note include those of 1931, 1954, and 1998.\n\n\nThe 1931 Central China floods or the Central China floods of 1931 were a series of floods that occurred in the Republic of China. The floods are generally considered among the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded, and almost certainly the deadliest of the 20th century (when pandemics and famines are discounted). Estimates of the total death toll range from 145,000 to between 3.7\u00a0million and 4\u00a0million.[77][78] The Yangtze again flooded in 1935, causing great loss of life.\n\n\nFrom June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan. The number of dead from this flood was estimated at 33,000, including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\n\nThe 1998 Yangtze River floods were a series of major floods that lasted from middle of June to the beginning of September 1998 along the Yangtze.[79]\nIn the summer of 1998, China experienced massive flooding of parts of the Yangtze River, resulting in 3,704 dead, 15\u00a0million homeless and $26\u00a0billion in economic loss.[80] Other sources report a total loss of 4150 people, and 180\u00a0million people were affected.[81] A staggering 25\u00a0million acres (100,000\u00a0km2) were evacuated, 13.3\u00a0million houses were damaged or destroyed. The floods caused $26\u00a0billion in damages.[81]\n\n\nThe 2016 China floods caused US$22\u00a0billion in damages.\n\n\nIn 2020, the Yangtze river saw the heaviest rainfall since 1961, with a 79% increase in June and July compared to the average for the period over the previous 41 years. A new theory suggested that abrupt reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, caused by shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, was a key cause of the intense downpours. Over the past decades rainfall had decreased due to increase of aerosols in the atmosphere, and lower greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 caused the opposite effect \u2013 a major increase in rain. Such a dramatic reduction of aerosols caused a dramatic change in the various components of the climate system, but such sudden change of the climate system would be very different from changes in response to continuous but gradual policy-driven emissions reductions.[82]\n\n\n\n### Degradation of the river[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Water resources in China \u00a7\u00a0Water quality\n\n![](image)Barges on the river\nBeginning in the 1950s, dams and dikes were built for flood control, land reclamation, irrigation, and control of diseases vectors such as blood flukes that caused Schistosomiasis. More than a hundred lakes were thusly cut off from the main river.[83] There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction.[84] Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, Baidang Lake shrunk from 100 square kilometers (39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in the 1950s to 40 square kilometers (15\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in 2005. Zhangdu Lake dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of carp who thrived in eutrophic water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage.[83][85] In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution.[86] The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable \"iron barrier\" that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the baiji dolphin, narrow-ridged finless porpoise and the Yangtze alligator. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.[87]\n\n\nIn 2020, a sweeping law was passed by the Chinese government to protect the ecology of the river. The new laws include strengthening ecological protection rules for hydropower projects along the river, banning chemical plants within 1 kilometer of the river, relocating polluting industries, severely restricting sand mining as well as a complete fishing ban on all the natural waterways of the river, including all its major tributaries and lakes.[88]\n\n\n\n### Contribution to ocean pollution[edit]\n\n\nThe Yangtze River produces more ocean plastic pollution than any other, according to The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch environmental research foundation that focuses on ocean pollution. 10 Rivers transport 90% of all the plastic that reaches the oceans, the Yangtze river being the biggest polluter by far.[89][90]\n\n\n\n### Reconnecting lakes[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002 a pilot program was initiated to reconnect lakes to the Yangtze with the objective to increase biodiversity and to alleviate flooding. The first lakes to be reconnected in 2004 were Zhangdu Lake, Honghu Lake, and Tian'e-Zhou in Hubei on the middle Yangtze. In 2005 Baidang Lake in Anhui was also reconnected.[85]\n\n\nReconnecting the lakes improved water quality and fish were able to migrate from the river into the lake, replenishing their numbers and genetic stock. The trial also showed that reconnecting the lake reduced flooding. The new approach also benefitted the farmers economically. Pond farmers switched to natural fish feed, which helped them breed better-quality fish that can be sold for more, increasing their income by 30%. Based on the successful pilot project, other provincial governments emulated the experience and also reestablished connections to lakes that had previously been cut off from the river. In 2005 a Yangtze Forum has been established bringing together 13 riparian provincial governments to manage the river from source to sea.[91] In 2006 China's Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes. As of 2010, provincial governments in five provinces and Shanghai set up a network of 40 effective protected areas, covering 16,500\u00a0km2 (6,400\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). As a result, populations of 47 threatened species increased, including the critically endangered Yangtze alligator. In the Shanghai area, reestablished wetlands now protect drinking water sources for the city. It is envisaged to extend the network throughout the entire Yangtze to eventually cover 102 areas and 185,000\u00a0km2 (71,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The mayor of Wuhan announced that six huge, stagnating urban lakes including the East Lake (Wuhan) would be reconnected at the cost of US$2.3\u00a0billion creating China's largest urban wetland landscape.[83][92]\n\n\n\n## Major cities along the river[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Populated places on the Yangtze River\n\n![](image)Map of the Yangtze river (facing west) showing the major settlements along its banks\n* Yushu\n* Panzhihua\n* Yibin\n* Luzhou\n* Hejiang\n* Chongqing\n* Fuling\n* Fengdu\n* Wanzhou\n* Yichang\n* Yidu\n* Jingzhou\n* Shashi\n* Shishou\n* Yueyang\n* Xianning\n* Wuhan\n* Ezhou\n* Huangshi\n* Huanggang\n* Chaohu\n* Chizhou\n* Jiujiang\n* Anqing\n* Tongling\n* Wuhu\n* Chuzhou\n* Ma'anshan\n* Taizhou\n* Yangzhou\n* Zhenjiang\n* Nanjing\n* Changzhou\n* Nantong\n* Shanghai\n\n## Crossings[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bridges and tunnels across the Yangtze River and Yangtze River power line crossings\n\n**Map all coordinates in \"Yangtze River bridges and tunnels\" using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\nUntil 1957, there were no bridges across the Yangtze River from Yibin to Shanghai. For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry. On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the *Zhong'anlun* disaster (October 15, 1945).\n\n\nThe river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China. In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at Hanyang and Pukou, and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train from Wuchang or Nanjing West.\n\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Soviet engineers assisted in the design and construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, a dual-use road-rail bridge, built from 1955 to 1957. It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River. The second bridge across the river that was built was a single-track railway bridge built upstream in Chongqing in 1959. The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze, in Nanjing. It was built after the Sino-Soviet Split and did not receive foreign assistance. Road-rail bridges were then built in Zhicheng (1971) and Chongqing (1980).\n\n\nBridge-building slowed in the 1980s before resuming in the 1990s and accelerating in the first decade of the 21st century. The Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge was built in 1992 as part of the Beijing-Jiujiang Railway. A second bridge in Wuhan was completed in 1995. By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai. These include some of the longest suspension and cable-stayed bridges in the world on the Yangtze Delta: Jiangyin Suspension Bridge (1,385 m, opened in 1999), Runyang Bridge (1,490 m, opened 2005), Sutong Bridge (1,088 m, opened 2008). The rapid pace of bridge construction has continued. The city of Wuhan now has six bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze.\n\n\nA number of power line crossings have also been built across the river.\n\n\n\n* ![Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the first bridge crossing Yangtze, was completed in 1957.](image)\n\nWuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the first bridge crossing Yangtze, was completed in 1957.\n* ![The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, a beam bridge, was completed in 1968.](image)\n\nThe Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, a beam bridge, was completed in 1968.\n* ![The Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge, an arch bridge, was completed in 1992.](image)\n\nThe Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge, an arch bridge, was completed in 1992.\n* ![The Yichang Yangtze Highway Bridge, a suspension bridge near the Gezhouba Dam lock, was completed in 1996.](image)\n\nThe Yichang Yangtze Highway Bridge, a suspension bridge near the Gezhouba Dam lock, was completed in 1996.\n* ![The Sutong Yangtze River Bridge, between Nantong and Suzhou, was one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in the world when it was completed in 2008.](image)\n\nThe Sutong Yangtze River Bridge, between Nantong and Suzhou, was one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in the world when it was completed in 2008.\n* ![The Caiyuanba Bridge, an arch bridge in Chongqing, was completed in 2007.](image)\n\nThe Caiyuanba Bridge, an arch bridge in Chongqing, was completed in 2007.\n* ![The cable-stayed Anqing Yangtze River Bridge at Anqing, was completed in 2005.](image)\n\nThe cable-stayed Anqing Yangtze River Bridge at Anqing, was completed in 2005.\n* ![Wuhan Metro Line 2 is the first underground rail line crossing the Yangtze River.](image)\n\nWuhan Metro Line 2 is the first underground rail line crossing the Yangtze River.\n\n\n## Dams[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Three Gorges Dam in 2006\n![](image)Diagram showing dams planned for the upper reaches of the Yangtze River\nAs of 2007, there are two dams built on the Yangtze river: Three Gorges Dam and Gezhouba Dam. The Three Gorges Dam is the largest power station in the world by installed capacity, at 22.5 GW. Several dams are operating or are being constructed on the upper portion of the river, the Jinsha River. Among them, the Xiluodu Dam is the third largest power station in the world, and the Baihetan Dam, planned to be commissioned in 2021, will be the second largest after the Three Gorges Dam.\n\n\n\n## Tributaries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A shipyard on the banks of the Yangtze building commercial river freight boats\nThe Yangtze River has over 700 tributaries. The major tributaries (listed from upstream to downstream) with the locations of where they join the Yangtze are:\n\n\n\n* Yalong River (Panzhihua, Sichuan)\n* Min River (Yibin, Sichuan)\n* Tuo River (Luzhou, Sichuan)\n* Chishui River (Hejiang, Sichuan)\n* Jialing River (Chongqing)\n* Wu River (Fuling, Chongqing)\n* Qing River (Yidu, Hubei)\n* Yuan River (via Dongting Lake)\n* Lishui River (via Dongting Lake)\n* Zi River (via Dongting Lake)\n* Xiang River (Yueyang, Hunan)\n* Han River (Wuhan, Hubei)\n* Gan River (near Jiujiang, Jiangxi)\n* Shuiyang River (Dangtu, Anhui)\n* Qingyi River (Wuhu, Anhui)\n* Chao Lake water system (Chaohu, Anhui)\n* Lake Tai water system (Shanghai)\n\n\nThe Huai River flowed into the Yellow Sea until the 20th century, but now primarily discharges into the Yangtze.\n\n\n\n* ![Gan River in Jiangxi](image)\n\nGan River in Jiangxi\n* ![Han River in Hubei](image)\n\nHan River in Hubei\n* ![Lake Dongting and the Yuan, Zi, Li, and Xiang Rivers in Hunan](image)\n\nLake Dongting and the Yuan, Zi, Li, and Xiang Rivers in Hunan\n* ![Wu River in Guizhou](image)\n\nWu River in Guizhou\n* ![Jialing River in eastern Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality](image)\n\nJialing River in eastern Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality\n* ![Min River in central Sichuan](image)\n\nMin River in central Sichuan\n* ![Yalong River in western Sichuan](image)\n\nYalong River in western Sichuan\n\n\n## Protected areas[edit]\n\n\n* Sanjiangyuan (\"Three Rivers' Sources\") National Nature Reserve in Qinghai\n* Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan\n\n\n## Wildlife[edit]\n\n\nThe Yangtze River has a high species richness, including many endemics. A high percentage of these are seriously threatened by human activities.[93]\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The two sturgeon species in the Yangtze (here Chinese sturgeon) are both seriously threatened.\nAs of 2011[update], 416 fish species are known from the Yangtze basin, including 362 that strictly are freshwater species. The remaining are also known from salt or brackish waters, such as the river's estuary or the East China Sea. This makes it one of the most species-rich rivers in Asia and by far the most species-rich in China (in comparison, the Pearl River has almost 300 fish species and the Yellow River 160).[93] 178 fish species are endemic to the Yangtze River Basin.[93] Many are only found in some section of the river basin and especially the upper reach (above Yichang, but below the headwaters in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) is rich with 279 species, including 147 Yangtze endemics and 97 strict endemics (found only in this part of the basin). In contrast, the headwaters, where the average altitude is above 4,500\u00a0m (14,800\u00a0ft), are only home to 14 highly specialized species, but 8 of these are endemic to the river.[93] The largest orders in the Yangtze are Cypriniformes (280 species, including 150 endemics), Siluriformes (40 species, including 20 endemics), Perciformes (50 species, including 4 endemics), Tetraodontiformes (12 species, including 1 endemic) and Osmeriformes (8 species, including 1 endemic). No other order has more than four species in the river and one endemic.[93]\n\n\nMany Yangtze fish species have declined drastically and 65 were recognized as threatened in the 2009 Chinese red list.[94] Among these are three that are considered entirely extinct (Chinese paddlefish, *Anabarilius liui liui* and *Atrilinea macrolepis*), two that are extinct in the wild (*Anabarilius polylepis*, *Schizothorax parvus*), four that are critically endangered *Euchiloglanis kishinouyei*, *Megalobrama elongata*, *Schizothorax longibarbus* and *Leiocassis longibarbus*).[94][95] Additionally, both the Yangtze sturgeon and Chinese sturgeon are considered critically endangered by the IUCN. The survival of these two sturgeon may rely on the continued release of captive bred specimens.[96][97] Although still listed as critically endangered rather than extinct by both the Chinese red list and IUCN, recent reviews have found that the Chinese paddlefish is extinct.[98][99] Surveys conducted between 2006 and 2008 by ichthyologists failed to catch any, but two probable specimens were recorded with hydroacoustic signals.[100] The last definite record was an individual that was accidentally captured near Yibin in 2003 and released after having been radio tagged.[95] The Chinese sturgeon is the largest fish in the river and among the largest freshwater fish in the world, reaching a length of 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft); the extinct Chinese paddlefish reputedly reached as much as 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft), but its maximum size is labeled with considerable uncertainty.[101][102][103]\n\n\n\n![](image)The silver carp is native to the river, but has (like other Asian carp) been spread through large parts of the world with aquaculture.\nThe largest threats to the Yangtze native fish are overfishing and habitat loss (such as building of dams and land reclamation), but pollution, destructive fishing practices (such as fishing with dynamite or poison) and introduced species also cause problems.[93] About 2\u20443 of the total freshwater fisheries in China are in the Yangtze Basin,[104] but a drastic decline in size of several important species has been recorded, as highlighted by data from lakes in the river basin.[93] In 2015, some experts recommend a 10-year fishing moratorium to allow the remaining populations to recover,[105] and in January 2020 China imposed a 10-year fishing moratorium on 332 sites along the Yangtze.[106] Dams present another serious problem, as several species in the river perform breeding migrations and most of these are non-jumpers, meaning that normal fish ladders designed for salmon are ineffective.[93] For example, the Gezhouba Dam blocked the migration of the paddlerfish and two sturgeon,[96][97][102] while also effectively splitting the Chinese high fin banded shark population into two[107] and causing the extirpation of the Yangtze population of the Japanese eel.[108] In an attempt of minimizing the effect of the dams, the Three Gorges Dam has released water to mimic the (pre-dam) natural flooding and trigger the breeding of carp species downstream.[109] In addition to dams already built in the Yangtze basin, several large dams are planned and these may present further problems for the native fauna.[109]\n\n\nWhile many fish species native to the Yangtze are seriously threatened, others have become important in fish farming and introduced widely outside their native range. A total of 26 native fish species of the Yangtze basin are farmed.[105] Among the most important are four Asian carp: grass carp, black carp, silver carp and bighead carp. Other species that support important fisheries include northern snakehead, Chinese perch, *Takifugu* pufferfish (mainly in the lowermost sections) and predatory carp.[93]\n\n\n\n### Other animals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The critically endangered Chinese alligator is one of the smallest crocodilians, reaching a maximum length of about 2\u00a0m (7\u00a0ft).[110]\nDue to commercial use of the river, tourism, and pollution, the Yangtze is home to several seriously threatened species of large animals (in addition to fish): the narrow-ridged finless porpoise, baiji (Yangtze river dolphin), Chinese alligator, Yangtze giant softshell turtle and Chinese giant salamander. This is the only other place besides the United States that is native to an alligator and paddlefish species. In 2010, the Yangtze population of finless porpoise was 1000 individuals. In December 2006, the Yangtze river dolphin was declared functionally extinct after an extensive search of the river revealed no signs of the dolphin's inhabitance.[111] In 2007, a large, white animal was sighted and photographed in the lower Yangtze and was tentatively presumed to be a *baiji*.[112] However, as there have been no confirmed sightings since 2004, the *baiji* is presumed to be functionally extinct at this time.[113] \"Baijis were the last surviving species of a large lineage dating back seventy million years and one of only six species of freshwater dolphins.\" It has been argued that the extinction of the Yangtze river dolphin was a result of the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, a project that has affected many species of animals and plant life found only in the gorges area.[114]\n\n\nNumerous species of land mammals are found in the Yangtze valley, but most of these are not directly associated with the river. Three exceptions are the semi-aquatic Eurasian otter, water deer and P\u00e8re David's deer.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)The entirely aquatic Chinese giant salamander is the world's largest amphibian, reaching up to 1.8\u00a0m (5.9\u00a0ft) in length.[116]\nIn addition to the very large and exceptionally rare Yangtze giant softshell turtle, several smaller turtle species are found in the Yangtze basin, its delta and valleys. These include the Chinese box turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Pan's box turtle, Yunnan box turtle, yellow pond turtle, Chinese pond turtle, Chinese stripe-necked turtle and Chinese softshell turtle, which all are considered threatened.[117]\n\n\nMore than 160 amphibian species are known from the Yangtze basin, including the world's largest, the critically endangered Chinese giant salamander.[118] It has declined drastically due to hunting (it is considered a delicacy), habitat loss and pollution.[116] The polluted Dian Lake, which is part of the upper Yangtze watershed (via Pudu River), is home to several highly threatened fish, but was also home to the Yunnan lake newt. This newt has not been seen since 1979 and is considered extinct.[119][120] In contrast, the Chinese fire belly newt from the lower Yangtze basin is one of the few Chinese salamander species to remain common and it is considered least concern by the IUCN.[120][121][122]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Chinese mitten crab is a commercially important species in the Yangtze,[123] but invasive in other parts of the world.[124]\nThe Yangtze basin contains a large number of freshwater crab species, including several endemics.[125] A particularly rich genus in the river basin is the potamid *Sinopotamon*.[126] The Chinese mitten crab is catadromous (migrates between fresh and saltwater) and it has been recorded up to 1,400\u00a0km (870\u00a0mi) up the Yangtze, which is the largest river in its native range.[124] It is a commercially important species in its native range where it is farmed,[123] but the Chinese mitten crab has also been spread to Europe and North America where considered invasive.[124]\n\n\nThe freshwater jellyfish *Craspedacusta sowerbii*, now an invasive species in large parts of the world, originates from the Yangtze.[127]\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\nThe Yangtze River cruise, also called the \"Three Gorges cruise\", is a popular tourist attraction.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Category: Tributaries of the Yangtze River\n* List of rivers in China\n* Northern and Southern China, traditionally divided by the Huai River but sometimes considered to separate at the Yangtze\n* *Rediscovering the Yangtze River*\n* Ship lifts in China\n* South-North Water Transfer Project\n* Steamboats on the Yangtze River\n* Yangtze River Crossing\n* Yangtze Service Medal\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Yangtze River http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110538/Yangtze-River Archived August 21, 2008, at the Wayback Machine\n2. **^** Zhang Zengxin; Tao Hui; Zhang Qiang; Zhang Jinchi; Forher, Nicola; H\u00f6rmann, Georg (2009). \"Moisture budget variations in the Yangtze River Basin, China, and possible associations with large-scale circulation\". *Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment*. **24** (5): 579\u2013589. doi:10.1007/s00477-009-0338-7.

It is the world's twelfth-longest river and the third-longest in Asia[1] with an estimated length of 4,909\u00a0km (3,050\u00a0mi)[1] and a drainage area of 795,000\u00a0km2 (307,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), discharging 475\u00a0km3 (114\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) of water annually.[2]\nFrom its headwaters in the Tibetan Plateau, the river runs through Southwest China (where it is officially called the **Lancang River**), Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and southern Vietnam. The extreme seasonal variations in flow and the presence of rapids and waterfalls in the Mekong make navigation difficult. Even so, the river is a major trade route between Tibet and Southeast Asia. The construction of hydroelectric dams along the Mekong in recent decades causes serious problems for the river's ecosystem, including the exacerbation of drought.[3][4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\nThe Mekong was originally called *Mae Nam Khong* from a contracted form of Tai shortened to *Mae Khong*.[6] In Thai and Lao, *Mae Nam* (\"Mother of Water[s]\") is used for large rivers and *Khong* is the proper name referred to as \"River Khong\". However, *Khong* is an archaic word meaning \"river\", loaned from Austroasiatic languages, such as Vietnamese *s\u00f4ng* (from \\**krong*) and Mon *kru\u014b* \"river\", which led to Chinese \u6c5f whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as /\\*k\u02e4ro\u014b/[7] and which long served as the proper name of the Yangtze before becoming a generic word for major rivers. To the early European traders, the Mekong River was also known as *Mekon River*, *May-Kiang River* and *Cambodia River*.[8]\n[9][10]\n[11][12]\n\n\nThe local names for the river include:\n\n\n\n1.

It originates in the \"three rivers source area\" on the Tibetan Plateau in the Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve. The reserve protects the headwaters of, from north to south, the Yellow (Huang He), the Yangtze, and the Mekong Rivers.[2] It flows through the Tibetan Autonomous Region and then southeast into Yunnan Province, and then the Three Parallel Rivers Area in the Hengduan Mountains, along with the Yangtze to its east and the Salween River (Nu Jiang in Chinese) to its west.\n\n\nThen the Mekong meets the China\u2013Myanmar border and flows about 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) along that border until it reaches the tripoint of China, Myanmar and Laos. From there it flows southwest and forms the border of Myanmar and Laos for about 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) until it arrives at the tripoint of Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand. This is also the point of confluence between the Ruak River (which follows the Thai\u2013Myanmar border) and the Mekong. The area of this tripoint is sometimes termed the Golden Triangle, although the term also refers to the much larger area of those three countries that was notorious as a drug producing region.\n\n\nFrom the Golden Triangle tripoint, the Mekong turns southeast to briefly form the border of Laos with Thailand.\n\n\nKhon Pi Long is a series of rapids along a 1.6-kilometre section of the Mekong River dividing Chiang Rai and Bokeo Province in Laos. The name of the rapids means 'where the ghost lost its way'.[13] It then turns east into the interior of Laos, flowing first east and then south for some 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) before meeting the border with Thailand again. Once more, it defines the Laos-Thailand border for some 850\u00a0km (530\u00a0mi) as it flows first east, passing the capital of Laos, Vientiane, then turns south. A second time, the river leaves the border and flows east into Laos soon passing the city of Pakse. Thereafter, it turns and runs more or less directly south, crossing into Cambodia.\n\n\nAt Phnom Penh the river is joined on the right bank by the river and lake system the Tonl\u00e9 Sap. When the Mekong is low, the Tonle Sap is a tributary: water flows from the lake and river into the Mekong. When the Mekong floods, the flow reverses: the floodwaters of the Mekong flow up the Tonle Sap.\n\n\nImmediately after the Sap River joins the Mekong by Phnom Penh, the Bassac River branches off the right (west) bank. The Bassac River is the first and main distributary of the Mekong. This is the beginning of the Mekong Delta. The two rivers, the Bassac to the west and the Mekong to the east, enter Vietnam shortly after this. In Vietnam, the Bassac is called the H\u1eadu River (S\u00f4ng H\u1eadu or H\u1eadu Giang); the main, eastern, branch of the Mekong is called the Ti\u1ec1n River or Ti\u1ec1n Giang. In Vietnam, distributaries of the eastern (main, Mekong) branch include the M\u1ef9 Tho River, the Ba Lai River, the H\u00e0m Lu\u00f4ng River, and the C\u1ed5 Chi\u00ean River.\n\n\n\n## Drainage basin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mekong River south of Chamdo.\n![](image)The Mekong from Phou si\n![](image)The confluence of the Mekong and the Nam Ou Rivers, Laos\nThe Mekong Basin can be divided into two parts: the \"upper Mekong basin\" in Tibet, and the \"lower Mekong basin\" from Yunnan downstream from China to the South China Sea.[14] From the point where it rises to its mouth, the most precipitous drop in the Mekong occurs in the upper Mekong basin, a stretch of some 2,200\u00a0km (1,400\u00a0mi). Here, it drops 4,500\u00a0m (14,800\u00a0ft) before it enters the lower basin where the borders of Thailand, Laos, China, and Myanmar come together in the Golden Triangle. Downstream from the Golden Triangle, the river flows for a further 2,600\u00a0km (1,600\u00a0mi) through Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia before entering the South China Sea via a complex delta system in Vietnam.[14]\n\n\n\n### Upper basin[edit]\n\n\nThe upper basin makes up 24% of the total area and contributes 15\u201320% of the water that flows into the Mekong River. The catchment here is steep and narrow with Soil erosion being a major problem and as a result of this, approximately 50% of the sediment in the river comes from the upper basin.\n\n\nIn Yunnan Province in China, the river and its tributaries are confined by narrow, deep gorges. The tributary river systems in this part of the basin are small. Only 14 have catchment areas that exceed 1,000\u00a0km2 (390\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), yet the greatest amount of loss of forest cover in the entire river system per square kilometer has occurred in this region due to heavy unchecked demand for natural resources. In the south of Yunnan, in Simao and Xishuangbanna Prefectures, the river changes as the valley opens out, the floodplain becomes wider, and the river becomes wider and slower.\n\n\n\n### Lower basin[edit]\n\n\nMajor tributary systems develop in the lower basin. These systems can be separated into two groups: tributaries that contribute to the major wet season flows, and tributaries that drain low relief regions of lower rainfall. The first group are left bank tributaries that drain the high rainfall areas of Laos. The second group are those on the right bank, mainly the Mun and Chi Rivers, that drain a large part of northeast Thailand.\n\n\nLaos lies almost entirely within the lower Mekong basin. Its climate, landscape and land use are the major factors shaping the hydrology of the river. The mountainous landscape means that only 16% of the country is farmed under lowland terrace or upland shifting cultivation.[14] With upland shifting agriculture (slash and burn), soils recover within 10 to 20 years but the vegetation does not. Shifting cultivation is common in the uplands of northern Laos and is reported to account for as much as 27% of the total land under rice cultivation.[14] As elsewhere in the basin, forest cover has been steadily reduced during the last three decades by shifting agriculture and permanent agriculture. The cumulative impacts of these activities on the river regime have not been measured. However, the hydrological impacts of land cover changes induced by the Vietnam War were quantified in two sub-catchments of the lower Mekong River basin.[15]\n\n\nLoss of forest cover in the Thai areas of the lower basin has been the highest of all the lower Mekong countries over the past 60 years. On the Khorat Plateau, which includes the Mun and Chi tributary systems, forest cover was reduced from 42% in 1961 to 13% in 1993.[14] Although this part of northeast Thailand has an annual rainfall of more than 1,000\u00a0mm, a high evaporation rate means it is classified as a semi-arid region. Consequently, although the Mun and Chi basins drain 15% of the entire Mekong basin, they only contribute 6% of the average annual flow.[14] Sandy and saline soils are the most common soil types, which makes much of the land unsuitable for wet rice cultivation. In spite of poor fertility, however, agriculture is intensive. Glutinous rice, maize, and cassava are the principal crops.[14] Drought is by far the major hydrological hazard in this region.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Floating homes on the Mekong, Cambodia\nAs the Mekong enters Cambodia, over 95% of its flows have already joined the river.[14] From here on downstream the terrain is flat and water levels rather than flow volumes determine the movement of water across the landscape. The seasonal cycle of changing water levels at Phnom Penh results in the unique \"flow reversal\" of water into and out of the Great Lake via the Tonle Sap River. Phnom Penh also marks the beginning of the delta system of the Mekong River. Here the mainstream begins to break up into an increasing number of branches.[14]\n\n\nIn Cambodia, wet rice is the main crop and is grown on the flood plains of the Tonle Sap, Mekong, and Bassac (the Mekong delta distributary known as the H\u1eadu in Vietnam) Rivers.[14] More than half of Cambodia remains covered with mixed evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest, but forest cover has decreased from 73% in 1973 to 63% in 1993.[14] Here, the river landscape is flat. Small changes in water level determine the direction of water movement, including the large-scale reversal of flow into and out of the Tonle Sap basin from the Mekong River.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mekong Delta, Vietnam\nThe Mekong Delta in Vietnam is farmed intensively and has little natural vegetation left. Forest cover is less than 10%. In the Central Highlands of Vietnam, forest cover was reduced from over 95% in the 1950s to around 50% in the mid-1990s.[14] Agricultural expansion and population pressure are the major reasons for land use and landscape change. Both drought and flood are common hazards in the Delta, which many people believe is the most sensitive to upstream hydrological change.[14]\n\n\n\n### Water flow along its course[edit]\n\n\n**Table 1: Country share of Mekong River Basin (MRB) and water flows**[14]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | China | Myanmar | Laos | Thailand | Cambodia | Vietnam | Total\n |\n| Basin area (km2) | 165,000 | 24,000 | 202,000 | 184,000 | 155,000 | 65,000 | 795,000\n |\n| Catchment as\u00a0% of MRB | 21 | 3 | 25 | 23 | 20 | 8 | 100\n |\n| Flow as\u00a0% of MRB | 16 | 2 | 35 | 18 | 18 | 11 | 100\n |\n\n\nBy taking into account hydrological regimes, physiography land use, and existing, planned and potential resource developments, the Mekong is divided into six distinct reaches:[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Mekong in Laos\n*Reach 1: Lancang Jiang or Upper Mekong River in China*. In this part of the river, the major source of water flowing into the river comes from melting snow on the Tibetan plateau. This volume of water is sometimes called the \"Yunnan component\" and plays an important role in the low-flow hydrology of the lower mainstream. Even as far downstream as Kratie, the Yunnan component makes up almost 30% of the average dry season flow. A major concern is that the ongoing and planned expansion of dams and reservoirs on the Mekong mainstream in Yunnan could have a significant effect on the low-flow regime of the lower Mekong basin system.[14][16][17]\n\n\n*Reach 2: Chiang Saen to Vientiane and Nong Khai*. This reach is almost entirely mountainous and covered with natural forest although there has been widespread slash and burn agriculture. Although this reach cannot be termed \"unspoiled\", the hydrological response is perhaps the most natural and undisturbed of all the lower basin. Many hydrological aspects of the lower basin start to change rapidly at the downstream boundary of this reach.[14]\n\n\nOn 19 July 2019 this reach of the river dropped to its lowest level in a century. Officials are particularly concerned as July is in the wet season, when mainstream flows are abundant historically. Locals are blaming low water on the newly constructed Xayaburi Dam, as it enters its test phase prior to the start of commercial operation in October 2019.[18]\n\n\n*Reach 3: Vientiane and Nong Khai to Pakse*. The boundary between Reach 2 and 3 is where the Mekong hydrology starts to change. Reach 2 is dominated in both wet and dry seasons by the Yunnan Component. Reach 3 is increasingly influenced by contributions from the large left bank tributaries in Laos, namely the Nam Ngum, Nam Theun, Nam Hinboun, Se Bang Fai, Se Bang Hieng and Se Done Rivers. The Mun-Chi river system from the right bank in Thailand enters the mainstream within this reach.[14]\n\n\n*Reach 4: Pakse to Kratie*. The main hydrological contributions to the mainstream in this reach come from the Se Kong, Se San, and Sre Pok catchments. Together, these rivers make up the largest hydrological sub-component of the lower basin. Over 25% of the mean annual flow volume to the mainstream at Kratie comes from these three river basins. They are the key element in the hydrology of this part of the system, especially to the Tonle Sap flow reversal.[14]\n\n\n*Reach 5: Kratie to Phnom Penh*. This reach includes the hydraulic complexities of the Cambodian floodplain, the Tonle Sap and the Great Lake. By this stage, over 95% of the total flow has entered the Mekong system. The focus turns from hydrology and water discharge to the assessment of water level, over- bank storage and flooding and the hydrodynamics that determine the timing, duration and volume of the seasonal flow reversal into and out of the Great Lake.[14]\n\n\n*Reach 6: Phnom Penh to the South China Sea*. Here the mainstream divides into a complex and increasingly controlled and artificial system of branches and canals. Key features of flow behaviour are tidal influences and salt water intrusion. Every year, 35\u201350% of this reach is flooded during the rainy season. The impact of road embankments and similar infrastructure developments on the movement of this flood water is an increasingly important consequence of development.[14]\n\n\nTable 2 summarises the mean annual flows along the mainstream. The mean annual flow entering the lower Mekong from China is equivalent to a relatively modest 450\u00a0mm depth of runoff. Downstream of Vientiane this increases to over 600\u00a0mm as the principal left bank tributaries enter the mainstream, mainly the Nam Ngum and Nam Theun. The flow level falls again, even with the right bank entry of the Mun-Chi system from Thailand. Although the Mun\u2013Chi basin drains 20% of the lower system, average annual runoff is only 250\u00a0mm. Runoff in the mainstream increases again with the entry from the left bank of the Se Kong from southern Laos and Se San and Sre Pok from Vietnam and Cambodia.\n\n\n\n![](image)Floating market, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1, Mekong delta\n![](image)C\u1ea7u kh\u1ec9 (monkey bridge) and small *n\u01b0\u1edbc m\u1eafm* (fish sauce) workshop on the bank of the Ti\u1ec1n River (branch of Mekong), Binh Dai District, Ben Tre Province, Vietnam\n![](image)Hamlet, Ti\u1ec1n River, Binh Dai District, Ben Tre Province, Vietnam\n**Table 2: Lower Mekong Mainstream annual flow (1960 to 2004) at selected sites.**[14]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mainstream site | Catchment area (km2) | Mean annual flow |  |  | as\u00a0% total Mekong\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | Discharge m3/s | Volume km3 | Runoff (mm) |  |\n| Chiang Saen | 189,000 | 2,700 | 85 | 450 | 19\n |\n| Luang Prabang | 268,000 | 3,900 | 123 | 460 | 27\n |\n| Chiang Khan | 292,000 | 4,200 | 133 | 460 | 29\n |\n| Vientiane | 299,000 | 4,400 | 139 | 460 | 30\n |\n| Nong Khai | 302,000 | 4,500 | 142 | 470 | 31\n |\n| Nakhon Phanom | 373,000 | 7,100 | 224 | 600 | 49\n |\n| Mukdahan | 391,000 | 7,600 | 240 | 610 | 52\n |\n| Pakse | 545,000 | 9,700 | 306 | 560 | 67\n |\n| Stung Treng | 635,000 | 13,100 | 413 | 650 | 90\n |\n| Krati\u00e9 | 646,000 | 13,200 | 416 | 640 | 91\n |\n| Basin Total | 760,000 | 14,500 | 457 | 600 | 100\n |\n\n\nFlows at Chiang Saen entering the lower basin from Yunnan make up about 15% of the wet season flow at Kratie. This rises to 40% during the dry season, even this far downstream. During the wet season, the proportion of average flow coming from Yunnan rapidly decreases downstream of Chiang Saen, from 70% to less than 20% at Kratie. The dry season contribution from Yunnan is much more significant. The major portion of the balance comes from Laos, which points to a major distinction in the low-flow hydrology of the river. One fraction comes from melting snow in China and Tibet and the rest from over-season catchment storage in the lower basin. This has implications for the occurrence of drought conditions. For example, if runoff from melting snow in any given year is very low, then flows upstream of Vientiane-Nong Khai would be lower.[14]\n\n\nIn a large river system like the Mekong, seasonal flows can be quite variable from year to year. Although the pattern of the annual hydrograph is fairly predictable, its magnitude is not. The average monthly flows along the mainstream are listed in Table 3, providing an indication of their range and variability from year to year. At Pakse, for example, flood season flows during August would exceed 20,000 cubic metres per second nine years out of ten, but exceed 34,000 m3/s only one year in ten.[14]\n\n\n**Table 3: Mekong Mainstream monthly discharge, 1960\u20132004 (m3/s).**[14]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Month | Chiang Saen | Luang Prabang | Vientiane | Nakhon Phanom | Mukdahan | Pakse | Kratie\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jan | 1,150 | 1,690 | 1,760 | 2,380 | 2,370 | 2,800 | 3,620\n |\n| Feb | 930 | 1,280 | 1,370 | 1,860 | 1,880 | 2,170 | 2,730\n |\n| Mar | 830 | 1,060 | 1,170 | 1,560 | 1,600 | 1,840 | 2,290\n |\n| Apr | 910 | 1,110 | 1,190 | 1,530 | 1,560 | 1,800 | 2,220\n |\n| May | 1,300 | 1,570 | 1,720 | 2,410 | 2,430 | 2,920 | 3,640\n |\n| Jun | 2,460 | 3,110 | 3,410 | 6,610 | 7,090 | 8,810 | 11,200\n |\n| Jul | 4,720 | 6,400 | 6,920 | 12,800 | 13,600 | 16,600 | 22,200\n |\n| Aug | 6,480 | 9,920 | 11,000 | 19,100 | 20,600 | 26,200 | 35,500\n |\n| Sep | 5,510 | 8,990 | 10,800 | 18,500 | 19,800 | 26,300 | 36,700\n |\n| Oct | 3,840 | 5,750 | 6,800 | 10,200 | 10,900 | 15,400 | 22,000\n |\n| Nov | 2,510 | 3,790 | 4,230 | 5,410 | 5,710 | 7,780 | 10,900\n |\n| Dec | 1,590 | 2,400 | 2,560 | 3,340 | 3,410 | 4,190 | 5,710\n |\n\n\nThere is little evidence from the last 45 years of data of any systematic changes in the hydrological regime of the Mekong.[14]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe internal drainage patterns of the Mekong are unusual when compared to those of other large rivers.[2] Most large river systems that drain the interiors of continents, such as the Amazon, Congo, and Mississippi, have relatively simple dendritic tributary networks that resemble a branching tree.[19]\n\n\nTypically, such patterns develop in basins with gentle slopes where the underlying geological structure is fairly homogeneous and stable, exerting little or no control on river morphology.[20] In marked contrast, the tributary networks of the Salween, Yangtze, and particularly the Mekong, are complex with different sub-basins often exhibiting different, and distinct, drainage patterns. These complex drainage systems have developed in a setting where the underlying geological structure is heterogeneous and active, and is the major factor controlling the course of rivers and the landscapes they carve out.[21]\n\n\nThe elevation of the Tibetan Plateau during the Tertiary period was an important factor in the genesis of the south-west monsoon,[22] which is the dominant climatic control influencing the hydrology of the Mekong Basin. Understanding the nature and timing of the elevation of Tibet (and the Central Highlands of Vietnam) therefore helps explain the provenance of sediment reaching the delta and the Tonle Sap Great Lake today. Studies of the provenance of sediments in the Mekong delta reveal a major switch in the source of sediments about eight million years ago (Ma).[23][24] From 36 to 8 Ma the bulk (76%) of the sediments deposited in the delta came from erosion of the bedrock in the Three Rivers Area. From 8 Ma to the present, however, the contribution from the Three Rivers Area fell to 40%, while that from the Central Highlands rose from 11 to 51%. One of the most striking conclusions of provenance studies is the small contribution of sediment from the other parts of the Mekong basin, notably the Khorat Plateau, the uplands of northern Laos and northern Thailand, and the mountain ranges south of the Three Rivers area.\n\n\nThe last glacial period came to an abrupt end about 19,000 years ago (19 ka) when sea levels rose rapidly, reaching a maximum of about 4.5 m above present levels in the early Holocene about 8 ka.[25] At this time the shoreline of the South China Sea almost reached Phnom Penh and cores recovered from near Angkor Borei contained sediments deposited under the influence of tides, and salt marsh and mangrove swamp deposits.[25] Sediments deposited in the Tonle Sap Great Lake about this time (7.9\u20137.3 ka) also show indications of marine influence, suggesting a connection to the South China Sea.[26] Although the hydraulic relationships between the Mekong and the Tonle Sap Great Lake systems during the Holocene are not well understood, it is clear that between 9,000 and 7,500 years ago the confluence of the Tonle Sap and the Mekong was in proximity to the South China Sea.\n\n\nThe present river morphology of the Mekong Delta developed over the last 6,000 years.[2] During this period, the delta advanced 200\u00a0km over the continental shelf of the South China Sea, covering an area of more than 62,500\u00a0km2. From 5.3 to 3.5 ka the delta advanced across a broad embayment formed between higher ground near the Cambodian border and uplands north of Ho Chi Minh City. During this phase of its development the delta was sheltered from the wave action of long-shore currents and was constructed largely through fluvial and tidal processes.[27] At this time the delta was advancing at a rate of 17\u201318 m per year. After 3.5 ka, however, the delta had built out beyond the embayment and became subject to wave action and marine currents. These deflected deposition south-eastwards in the direction of the C\u00e0 Mau Peninsula, which is one of the most recent features of the delta.\n\n\nFor much of its length the Mekong flows through bedrock channels, i.e., channels that are confined or constrained by bedrock or old alluvium in the bed and riverbanks.[2] Geomorphologic features normally associated with the alluvial stretches of mature rivers, such as meanders, oxbow lakes, cut-offs, and extensive floodplains are restricted to a short stretch of the mainstream around Vientiane and downstream of Kratie where the river develops alluvial channels that are free of control exerted by the underlying bedrock.\n\n\nThe Mekong basin is not normally considered a seismically active area as much of the basin is underlain by the relatively stable continental block. Nonetheless, the parts of the basin in northern Laos, northern Thailand, Myanmar and China do experience frequent earthquakes and tremors. The magnitude of these earthquakes rarely exceeds 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale and is unlikely to cause material damage.[28][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)19th century map showing the Mekong river as the \"Mei-Kong\" river\nThe difficulty of navigating the river has meant that it has divided, rather than united, the people who live near it. The earliest known settlements date to 210 BCE, with Ban Chiang being an excellent example of early Iron Age culture. The earliest recorded civilization was the 1st century Indianised-Khmer culture of Funan, in the Mekong delta. Excavations at Oc Eo, near modern An Giang, have found coins from as far away as the Roman Empire. This was succeeded by the Khmer culture Chenla state around the 5th century. The Khmer empire of Angkor was the last great Indianized state in the region. From around the time of the fall of the Khmer empire, the Mekong was the front line between the emergent states of Siam and Tonkin (North Vietnam), with Laos and Cambodia, then on the coast, torn between their influence.\n\n\nThe first European to encounter the Mekong was the Portuguese Ant\u00f3nio de Faria in 1540. A European map of 1563 depicts the river, although even by then little was known of the river upstream of the delta. European interest was sporadic: the Spanish and Portuguese mounted some missionary and trade expeditions, while the Dutch Gerrit van Wuysthoff led an expedition up the river as far as Vientiane in 1641\u201342.\n\n\nThe French invaded the region in the mid-19th century, capturing Saigon in 1861, and establishing a protectorate over Cambodia in 1863.\n\n\n\n![](image)Members of the Mekong expedition of 1866\u20131868\nThe first systematic European exploration began with the French Mekong Expedition led by Ernest Doudard de Lagr\u00e9e and Francis Garnier, which ascended the river from its mouth to Yunnan between 1866 and 1868. Their chief finding was that the Mekong had too many falls and rapids to ever be useful for navigation. The river's source was found by Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov in 1900.\n\n\nFrom 1893, the French extended their control of the river into Laos, establishing French Indochina by the first decade of the 20th century. This lasted until the First and Second Indochina Wars expelled French from its former colony and defeated US-supported governments.\n\n\nDuring the wars in Indochina in the 1970s, a significant quantity of explosives (sometimes, entire barges loaded with military ordnance) sank in the Cambodian section of the Mekong (as well as in the country's other waterways). Besides being a danger for fishermen, unexploded ordnance also creates problems for bridge and irrigation systems construction. As of 2013, Cambodian volunteers are being trained, with the support of the Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement within the US State Department Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, to conduct underwater explosive removal.[29]\n\n\nThe many maps of the river basin produced throughout recorded history reflect the region's changing human geography and politics.[30]\n\n\nIn 1995, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam established the Mekong River Commission (MRC) to manage and coordinate the use and care of the Mekong. In 1996 China and Myanmar became \"dialogue partners\" of the MRC and the six countries now work together in a cooperative framework. In 2000, the governments of China, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar signed a *Agreement on Commercial Navigation on Lancang-Mekong River among the Governments of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, the Union of Myanmar and the Kingdom of Thailand* which is the mechanism for cooperation with regard to riverine trade on the upper stretches of the Mekong.[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Natural history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Extirpated from most of its pan-Asian range, Cantor's giant softshell turtle can still be found along a stretch of the Mekong in Cambodia (Khmer called \"Kanteay\")\nThe Mekong basin is one of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world. Only the Amazon boasts a higher level of bio-diversity.[2] Biota estimates for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) include 20,000 plant species, 430 mammals, 1,200 birds, 800 reptiles and amphibians,[33] and an estimated 850 freshwater fish species (excluding euryhaline species mainly found in salt or brackish water, as well as introduced species).[34] The most species rich orders among the freshwater fish in the river basin are cypriniforms (377 species) and catfish (92 species).[35]\n\n\nNew species are regularly described from the Mekong. In 2009, 145 species previously unknown to science were described from the region, including 29 fish species, two bird species, 10 reptiles, five mammals, 96 plants, and six amphibians.[36] Between 1997 and 2015, an average of two new species per week were discovered in the region.[37] The Mekong Region contains 16 WWF Global 200 ecoregions, the greatest concentration of ecoregions in mainland Asia.[2]\n\n\nNo other river is home to so many species of very large fish.[38] The biggest include three species of *Probarbus* barbs, which can grow up to 1.5\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft) and weigh 70\u00a0kg (150\u00a0lb),[39] the giant freshwater stingray (*Himantura polylepis*, syn. *H. chaophraya*), which can reach at least 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) in length and 1.9\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) in width,[40] the giant pangasius (*Pangasius sanitwongsei*), giant barb (*Catlocarpio siamensis*) and the endemic Mekong giant catfish (*Pangasianodon gigas*). The last three can grow up to about 3\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) in length and weigh 300\u00a0kg (660\u00a0lb).[38] All of these have declined drastically because of dams, flood control, and overfishing.[38]\n\n\nOne species of freshwater dolphin, the Irrawaddy dolphin (*Orcaella brevirostris*), was once common in the whole of the lower Mekong but is now very rare, with only 85 individuals remaining.[41]\n\n\nAmong other wetland mammals that have been living in and around the river are the smooth-coated otter (*Lutra perspicillata*) and fishing cat (*Prionailurus viverrinus*).\n\n\nThe endangered Siamese crocodile (*Crocodylus siamensis*) occurs in small isolated pockets within the northern Cambodian and Laotian portions of the Mekong River. The saltwater crocodile (*Crocodylus porosus*) once ranged from the Mekong Delta up the river into Tonle Sap and beyond but is now extinct in the river, along with being extinct in all of Vietnam and possibly even Cambodia.\n\n\n\n### Protected areas[edit]\n\n\n* The headwaters of the Mekong in Zadoi County, Qinghai, China, are protected in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve. The name Sanjiangyuan means \"the sources of the Three Rivers\". The reserve also includes the headwaters of the Yellow River and the Yangtze.\n* The section of the river flowing through deep gorges in Yunnan Province is part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n* The Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve in Cambodia contains the largest lake in Southeast Asia. It is a UNESCO Biosphere reserve.\n\n\n![](image)Bank erosion on the Song Tien, a Mekong branch, Binh Dai District, Ben Tre Province, Vietnam.\n### Natural phenomena[edit]\n\n\nThe low tide level of the river in Cambodia is lower than the high tide level out at sea, and the flow of the Mekong inverts with the tides throughout its stretch in Vietnam and up to Phnom Penh. The very flat Mekong delta area in Vietnam is thus prone to flooding, especially in the provinces of An Giang and Dong Thap (\u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p), near the Cambodian border.\n\n\n\n## Fisheries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fish Farming on Mekong branch, Song Tien, \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province, Vietnam\nAquatic biodiversity in the Mekong River system is the second highest in the world after the Amazon.[42][43]\nThe Mekong boasts the most concentrated biodiversity per hectare of any river.[44] The largest recorded freshwater fish, a 300\u00a0kg giant freshwater stingray in 2022 and previously a 293\u00a0kg Mekong giant catfish in 2005, were both caught in the Mekong River.[45]\n\n\nThe commercially valuable fish species in the Mekong are generally divided between \"black fish\", which inhabit low oxygen, slow moving, shallow waters, and \"white fish\", which inhabit well oxygenated, fast moving, deeper waters.[46] People living within the Mekong River system generate many other sources of food and income from what are often termed \"other aquatic animals\" (OAAs) such as freshwater crabs, shrimp, snakes, turtles, and frogs.\n\n\nOAAs account for about 20% of the total Mekong catch.[2] When fisheries are discussed, catches are typically divided between the wild capture fishery (i.e., fish and other aquatic animals caught in their natural habitat), and aquaculture (fish reared under controlled conditions). Wild capture fisheries play the most important role in supporting livelihoods. Wild capture fisheries are largely open access fisheries, which poor rural people can access for food and income.\n\n\nBroadly, there are three types of fish habitats in the Mekong: i) the river, including all the main tributaries, rivers in the major flood zone, and the Tonle Sap, which altogether yield about 30% of wild catch landings; ii) rain-fed wetlands outside the river-floodplain zone, including mainly rice paddies in formerly forested areas and usually inundated to about 50\u00a0cm, yielding about 66% of wild catch landings; and iii) large water bodies outside the flood zone, including canals and reservoirs yielding about 4% of wild catch landings.[2]\n\n\nThe Mekong Basin has one of the world's largest and most productive inland fisheries.[42][47][48][49] An estimated two million tonnes of fish are landed a year, in addition to almost 500,000 tonnes of other aquatic animals.[50] Aquaculture yields about two million tonnes of fish a year.[46] Hence, the lower Mekong basin yields about 4.5 million tonnes of fish and aquatic products annually. The total economic value of the fishery is between US$3.9 and US$7 billion a year.[2] Wild capture fisheries alone have been valued at US$2 billion a year.[48] This value increases considerably when the multiplier effect is included, but estimates vary widely.\n\n\nAn estimated 2.56 million tonnes of inland fish and other aquatic animals are consumed in the lower Mekong every year.[46] Aquatic resources make up between 47 and 80% of animal protein in rural diets for people who live in the Lower Mekong Basin.[48][51][52] Fish are the cheapest source of animal protein in the region and any decline in the fishery is likely to significantly impact nutrition, especially among the poor.[42][51][53][54] Fish are the staple of the diet in Laos and Cambodia, with around 80% of the Cambodian population's annual protein intake coming from fish caught in the Mekong River system, with no alternative source to replace it. An MRC report claims that dam projects on the Mekong River will reduce aquatic life by 40% by 2020, and predicted that 80% of fish will be depleted by 2040. Thailand will be impacted, as its fish stocks in the Mekong will decline by 55%, Laos will be reduced by 50%, Cambodia by 35%, and Vietnam by 30%.[55]\n\n\nIt is estimated that 40 million rural people, more than two-thirds of the rural population in the lower Mekong basin, are engaged in the wild capture fishery.[2] Fisheries contribute significantly to a diversified livelihood strategy for many people, particularly the poor, who are highly dependent on the river and its resources for their livelihoods.[47][48][52] They provide a principal form of income for numerous people and act as a safety net and coping strategy in times of poor agricultural harvests or other difficulties.[47][48][52] In Laos alone, 71% of rural households (2.9 million people) rely on fisheries for either subsistence or additional cash income. Around the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia, more than 1.2 million people live in fishing communes and depend almost entirely on fishing for their livelihoods.[2]\n\n\n\n## Dams[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hydropower in the Mekong River Basin\n\nAs of at least 2016, the Mekong has the fastest-growing hydropower construction of any large river basin worldwide.[56] China built ten[57] or eleven[58] cascade dams on the Mekong mainstream between 1995 and mid-2019, leaving Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand without same amount of water as before investment.[59] As part of China's Great Western Development program, China's five large state-owned hydropower companies planned, underwrote, and built the majority of dams on the river and its tributaries.[60]:\u200a220\n\n\nThe Lao government has also prioritized hydropower development on the river and its tributaries, describing itself as the \"Battery of Asia.\"[60]:\u200a220\u2013221 Hydropower has brought in significant foreign exchange to Laos.[60]:\u200a221 Much of the Lao hydropower has been exported to Thailand, which in turn has benefited from Lao hydropower in developing its poorer areas, especially in Thailand's northeast.[60]:\u200a221\n\n\nThe Jinghong Dam, as of January 2020[update] the nearest Chinese dam upstream of the Thai border, has caused huge fluctuations in river levels, affecting people's livelihoods downstream by disrupting the river's natural cycle. It is impacting the ecosystem, disturbing the migratory patterns of fish as well as riverbank plants and local agriculture downstream.[61]\n\n\nDownstream countries Vietnam and Cambodia generate some hydropower, but primarily experience negative ecological and social effects of upstream hydropower development.[60]:\u200a221\n\n\n\n## Navigation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mekong ferry, Neak Loeung, Cambodia\n![](image)Slow cruise boats, Pakbeng, Laos\nFor thousands of years the Mekong River has been an important conduit for people and goods between the many towns on its banks. Traditional forms of trade in small boats linking communities continue today, however the river is also becoming an important link in international trade routes, connecting the six Mekong countries to each other, and also to the rest of the world.[2] The Mekong is still a wild river and navigation conditions vary greatly along its length. Broadly, navigation of the river is divided between upper and lower Mekong, with the \"upper\" part of the river defined as the stretch north of the Khone Falls in southern Laos and the \"lower\" part as the stretch below these falls.\n\n\nNarrower and more turbulent sections of water in the upstream parts of the Mekong River, coupled with large annual water level variations continue to present a challenge to navigation. The seasonal variations in water level directly affect trade in this section of the river. Volumes of trade being shipped decrease by more than 50%, primarily due to the reduced draughts available during the low water season (June\u2013January).[2] Despite these difficulties, the Mekong River is already an important link in the transit chain between Kunming and Bangkok with about 300,000 tonnes of goods shipped via this route each year.[2] The volume of this trade is expected to increase by 8\u201311% per year. Port infrastructure is being expanded to accommodate the expected growth in traffic, with new facilities planned for Chiang Saen port.[2]\n\n\nIn Laos, 50 and 100 DWT vessels are operated for regional trade. Cargos carried are timber, agricultural products, and construction materials.[2] Thailand imports a wide variety of products from China, including vegetables, fruit, agricultural products, and fertilisers. The main exports from Thailand are dried longan, fish oil, rubber products, and consumables. Nearly all the ships carrying cargo to and from Chiang Saen Port are 300 DWT Chinese flag vessels.[2]\n\n\nWaterborne trade in the lower Mekong countries of Vietnam and Cambodia has grown significantly, with trends in container traffic at Phnom Penh port and general cargo through Can Tho port both showing steady increases until 2009 when a decrease in cargo volumes can be attributed to the global financial crisis and a subsequent decline in demand for the export of garments to the US.[2] In 2009, Mekong trade received a significant boost with the opening of a new deep-water port at Cai Mep in Vietnam. This new port has generated a renewed focus on the Mekong River as a trade route. The Cai Mep container terminals can accommodate vessels with a draught of 15.2 m, equivalent to the largest container ships in the world. These mother vessels sail directly to Europe or the United States, which means that goods can be shipped internationally to and from Phnom Penh with only a single transshipment at Cai Mep.[2]\n\n\nAs an international river, a number of agreements exist between the countries that share the Mekong to enable trade and passage between them. The most important of these, which address the full length of the river, are:[2]\n\n\n\n* Agreement between China and Lao PDR on Freight and Passenger Transport along the Lancang\u2013Mekong River, adopted in November 1994.\n* Agreement on the Cooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin, Article 9, Freedom of Navigation, 5 April 1995, Chiang Rai.\n* Hanoi Agreement between Cambodia and Viet Nam on Waterway Transportation, 13 December 1998.\n* Agreement between and among the Governments of the Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam for Facilitation of Cross border Transport of Goods and People, (amended at Yangon, Myanmar), signed in Vientiane, 26 November 1999.\n* Agreement on Commercial Navigation on Lancang\u2013Mekong River among the governments of China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, adopted at Tachileik, 20 April 2000.\n* Phnom Penh Agreement between Cambodia and Vietnam on the Transit of Goods, 7 September 2000.\n* New Agreement on Waterway Transportation between Vietnam and Cambodia, signed in Phnom Penh, 17 December 2009.\n\n\nIn December 2016, the Thai cabinet of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha agreed \"in principle\" to a plan to dredge stretches of the Mekong and demolish rocky outcrops that are hindrances to easy navigation. The international Lancang-Mekong River navigation improvement plan for 2015\u20132025, conceived by China, Myanmar, Lao, and Thailand, aims to make the river more navigable for 500-tonne cargo vessels sailing the river from Yunnan to Luang Prabang, a distance of 890 kilometres.[62] China has been the driving force behind the demolition plan as it aims to expand trade in the area.[63] The plan is split into two phases. The first phase, from 2015 to 2020, involves a survey, a design, and an assessment of the environmental and social impacts of the project. These have to be approved by the four countries involved: China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand. The second phase (2020\u20132025) involves navigational improvements from Simao in China to 243 border posts in China and Myanmar, a distance of 259\u00a0km.[62] Local groups have countered that native inhabitants already operate their boats year-round and that the plan to blast the rapids is not about making life better for local people, but about enabling year-round traffic of large Chinese commercial boats.[64]\n\n\nOn 4 February 2020, the Thai Cabinet voted to stop the project to blast and dredge 97\u00a0km of the river bed after Beijing failed to stump up the money for further surveys of the affected area.[65]\n\n\n\n## Bridges[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of crossings of the Mekong River\n\n![](image)Kizuna Bridge cross Mekong at Kampong Cham\nConstruction of Myanmar\u2013Laos Friendship Bridge started on 19 February 2013. The bridge will be 691.6\u00a0m (2,269\u00a0ft) long and have an 8.5\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft) wide two-lane motorway.[66]\n\n\nThe Thai\u2013Lao Friendship Bridge (Thai: \u0e2a\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e19\u0e21\u0e34\u0e15\u0e23\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e \u0e44\u0e17\u0e22-\u0e25\u0e32\u0e27, RTGS:\u00a0*Saphan Mittraphap Thai-Lao*) connects Nong Khai city with Vientiane in Laos. The 1,170\u00a0m-long (3,840\u00a0ft) bridge opened on 8 April 1994. It has two 3.5\u00a0m-wide (11\u00a0ft) lanes with a single railway line in the middle. On 20 March 2004, the Thai and Lao governments agreed to extend the railway to Tha Nalaeng in Laos. This extension has since been completed.\n\n\nThe Second Thai\u2013Lao Friendship Bridge connects Mukdahan to Savannakhet. The two-lane, 12\u00a0m-wide (39\u00a0ft), 1,600\u00a0m-long (5,200\u00a0ft) bridge opened to the public on 9 January 2007.\n\n\nThe Third Thai\u2013Lao Friendship Bridge opened for traffic on 11 November 2011, connecting Nakhon Phanom Province (Thailand) and Thakhek (Laos), as part of Asian Highway 3. The Chinese and Thai governments agreed to build the bridge and share the estimated US$33 million cost.\n\n\nThe Fourth Thai\u2013Lao Friendship Bridge opened to traffic on 11 December 2013.[67] It links Chiang Rai Province, Thailand with Ban Houayxay, Laos.\n\n\nThere is one bridge over the Mekong entirely within Laos. Unlike the Friendship Bridges, it is not a border crossing. It is at Pakse in Champasak Province. It is 1,380\u00a0m (4,528\u00a0ft) long, and was completed in 2000. 15\u00b06\u203219.95\u2033N 105\u00b048\u203249.51\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff15.1055417\u00b0N 105.8137528\u00b0E\ufeff / 15.1055417; 105.8137528\ufeff (Pakxe)).\n\n\nThe Kizuna Bridge is in Cambodia, in the city of Kampong Cham, on the road linking Phnom Penh with the remote provinces of Ratanakiri and Mondolkiri, and Laos. The bridge opened for traffic on 11 December 2001.\n\n\nThe Prek Tamak Bridge, 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) north of Phnom Penh opened in 2010.\n\n\nPhnom Penh itself has no bridge under construction yet, although two new bridges have recently opened on the Tonle Sap, and the main bridge on the highway to Ho Chi Minh was duplicated in 2010.\n\n\nAnother new bridge was built at Neak Leung on the Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh Highway 1 with Japanese government assistance, and opened in 2015.\n\n\nIn Vietnam, since the year 2000 M\u1ef9 Thu\u1eadn Bridge crosses the first channel\u2014the left, main branch of the Mekong, the S\u00f4ng Ti\u1ec1n or Ti\u1ec1n Giang\u2014near V\u0129nh Long and since 2008 R\u1ea1ch Mi\u1ec5u Bridge crosses it near M\u1ef9 Tho, between the provinces of Ti\u1ec1n Giang and B\u1ebfn Tre.\n\n\nC\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 Bridge crosses the second channel\u2014the right, main distributary of the Mekong, the Bassac (Song Hau). Inaugurated in 2010, it is the longest main span cable-stayed bridge in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n## Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nDrought linked to a changing climate and dozens of hydroelectric dams are damaging the Mekong ecosystem.[68][69][70] When drought ends and the inevitable floods begin, the effects of Mekong dams on flood pulse dynamics over the entire Lower Mekong are poorly understood.[71]\n\n\nSewage treatment is rudimentary in towns and urban areas throughout much of the Mekong's length, such as Vientiane in Laos. Water pollution impacts the river's ecological integrity as a result.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMuch of the 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic present on earth[72] makes its way to the oceans. Ninety percent of plastic in the oceans is flushed there by just 10 rivers. The Mekong is one of them.[73]\n\n\nA growing number of academics, NGOs, and scientists have urged the international community and the Mekong River Commission to reduce the use of hydropower, giving concerns of long-term sustainability. Some of them have urged an immediate moratorium on new construction of hydropower projects and a shift to solar and other forms of renewable energy, which are becoming more competitive and faster to install.[74]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Rivers portal\n\n\n* Greater Mekong Subregion\n* Greater Mekong Sub-region Academic and Research Network\n* GMS Environment Operations Center\n* Indochina\n* Sekong River\n* Mekong River Basin Hydropower\n* Mekong River massacre 2011 killings on Mekong river\n* Stung Sen River\n* Mekong Expedition of 1866-1868\n* Fair river sharing\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** S.

It is the chief tributary of the Ob and is also the longest tributary river in the world.\n\n\nThe river's source lies in the Mongolian Altai in Dzungaria (the northern part of Xinjiang, China) close to the border with Mongolia. \n\n\nThe Irtysh's main tributaries include the Tobol, Demyanka and the Ishim. The Ob-Irtysh system forms a major drainage basin in Asia, encompassing most of Western Siberia and the Altai Mountains.\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map including the lower reaches of the Irtysh River\n![](image)The Irtysh in Omsk\n![](image)The Irtysh near Pavlodar in Kazakhstan\nFrom its origins as the *Kara-Irtysh* (Vast Irtysh, kara means Vast in Turkic languages but also black. But in the context and geographic terms usually refers vast) in the Mongolian Altay mountains in Xinjiang, China, the Irtysh flows northwest through Lake Zaysan in Kazakhstan, meeting the Ishim and Tobol rivers before merging with the Ob near Khanty-Mansiysk in western Siberia, Russia after 4,248 kilometres (2,640\u00a0mi).\n\n\nThe name **Black Irtysh** (*Kara-Irtysh* in Kazakh, or *Cherny Irtysh* in Russian) is applied by some authors, especially in Russia and Kazakhstan, to the upper course of the river, from its source entering Lake Zaysan. The term **White Irtysh**, in opposition to the Black Irtysh, was occasionally used in the past to refer to the Irtysh below lake Zaysan;[3] now this usage is largely obsolete.\n\n\n\n### Main tributaries[edit]\n\n\nThe largest tributaries of the Irtysh are, from source to mouth:\n\n\n\n* Kelan (right)\n* Burqin (right)\n* Kalzhyr (right)\n* K\u00fcrshim (right)\n* Naryn (right)\n* Bukhtarma (right)\n* Ulba (right)\n* Uba (right)\n* Chagan (left)\n* Om (right)\n* Tara (right)\n* Uy (right)\n* Osha (left)\n* Shish (right)\n* Ishim (left)\n* Tobol (left)\n* Noska (left)\n* Demyanka (right)\n* Konda (left)\n\n## Economic use[edit]\n\n\nIn Kazakhstan and Russia, tankers, passenger and Cargo ships navigate the river during the ice-free season, between April and October. Omsk, home to the headquarters of the state-owned Irtysh River Shipping Company, functions as the largest river port in Western Siberia.\n\n\nOn the Kazakhstan section of the river there are presently three major hydroelectric plants, namely at Bukhtarma, Ust-Kamenogorsk and Shulbinsk. The world's deepest lock, with a drop of 42 metres (138\u00a0ft), allows river traffic to by-pass the dam at Ust-Kamenogorsk.[4] Plans exist for the construction of several more dams.\n\n\n\n![](image)Tobolsk river wharves in 1912\nThree dams have been constructed on the Chinese section of the Irtysh as well:\nthe Keketuohai (\u53ef\u53ef\u6258\u6d77) Dam (47\u00b010\u203251\u2033N 89\u00b042\u203235\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff47.18083\u00b0N 89.70972\u00b0E\ufeff / 47.18083; 89.70972),\nthe Kalasuke (\u5580\u814a\u5851\u514b) Dam (47\u00b008\u203214\u2033N 88\u00b053\u203215\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff47.13722\u00b0N 88.88750\u00b0E\ufeff / 47.13722; 88.88750),[5][6] and\nthe Project 635 Dam. There are also the Burqin Chonghu'er Dam and the Burqin Shankou Dam on the Irtysh's right tributary, the Burqin River and the Jilebulake Dam and Haba River Shankou Dam on another right tributary, the Haba River.\n\n\nThe Northern river reversal proposals, widely discussed by the USSR planners and scientists in the 1960s and 1970s, would send some of the Irtysh's (and possibly Ob's) water to the water-deficient regions of central Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Some versions of this project would have seen the direction of flow of the Irtysh reversed in its section between the mouth of the Tobol (at Tobolsk) and the confluence of the Irtysh with the Ob at Khanty-Mansiysk, thus creating an \"Anti-Irtysh\".[7]\nWhile these gigantic interbasin transfer schemes were not implemented, a smaller Irtysh\u2013Karaganda Canal was built between 1962 and 1974 to supply water to the dry Kazakh steppes and to one of the country's main industrial center, Karaganda. In 2002, pipelines were constructed to supply water from the canal to the Ishim and Kazakhstan's capital, Nur-Sultan.\n\n\nIn China, a short canal was constructed in 1987 (water intake at 47\u00b026\u203231\u2033N 87\u00b034\u203211\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff47.44194\u00b0N 87.56972\u00b0E\ufeff / 47.44194; 87.56972) to divert some of the Irtysh water to the endorrheic Lake Ulungur, whose level had been falling precipitously due to the increasing irrigation use of the lake's main affluent, the Ulungur River.[8] In the last years of the 20th century and the early 2000s, a much more major project, the Irtysh\u2013Karamay\u2013Ur\u00fcmqi Canal was completed. Increased water use in China has caused significant concerns among Kazakh and Russian environmentalists.[9][10]\nAccording to a report published by Kazakhstan fishery researchers in 2013, the total Irtysh water use in China is about 3 cubic kilometres (0.7\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) per year; as a result, only about 2/3 of what would be the river's \"natural\" flow (6\u00a0km3 out of 9\u00a0km3) reach the Kazakh border.[11]\n\n\n\n## Cities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An aerial view of the Irtysh in Omsk\nMajor cities along the Irtysh, from source to mouth, include:\n\n\n\n* in China: Fuyun, Beitun, Burqin\n* in Kazakhstan: Oskemen, Semey, Aksu, Pavlodar\n* in Russia: Omsk, Tara, Tobolsk, Khanty-Mansiysk\n\n\n## Bridges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sixty Years of Victory Bridge in Omsk. (The name commemorates the 60th anniversary of the V-E Day)\nSeven railway bridges span the Irtysh. They are located in the following cities:\n\n\n\n* About 15\u00a0km downstream from Serebryansk (on the dead-end branch line from Oskemen to Zyryanovsk)\n* Oskemen\n* Semey, on the Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway\n* Pavlodar, on the South Siberian rail line (Nur-Sultan to Barnaul)\n* near Cherlak, on the Middle Siberian rail line (\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c)\n* Omsk, on the Trans-Siberian Railway. Opened in 1896, this is the oldest bridge on the river.\n* Tobolsk, on the Tyumen-Surgut line\n\n\nAs the Kuytun\u2013Beitun Railway in China's Xinjiang is being extended toward Altay City, a railway bridge over the Irtysh at Beitun will need to be constructed as well.\n\n\nNumerous highway bridges over the Irtysh exist in China, Kazakhstan, and Russia.\n\n\nThe last bridge downstream on the Irtysh, a highway bridge opened in 2004, can be found at Khanty-Mansiysk, right before the river's confluence with Ob.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Irtysh River landscape in Burqin County, China\nA number of Mongol and Turkic peoples occupied the river banks for many centuries. In 657, Tang Dynasty general Su Dingfang defeated Ashina Helu, qaghan of the Western Turkic Khaganate, at the Battle of Irtysh River, ending the Tang campaign against the Western Turks.[12] Helu's defeat ended the Khaganate, strengthened Tang control of Xinjiang, and led to Tang suzerainty over the western Turks.[13]\n\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries the lower and middle courses of the Irtysh lay within the Tatar Khanate of Sibir; its capital, Qashliq (also known as Sibir) was located on the Irtysh a few kilometres upstream from the mouth of the Tobol (where today's Tobolsk is situated).\n\n\nThe Khanate of Sibir was conquered by the Russians in the 1580s. The Russians started building fortresses and towns next to the sites of former Tatar towns; one of the first Russian towns in Siberia (after Tyumen) was Tobolsk, founded in 1587 at the fall of the Tobol into the Irtysh, downstream from the former Qashliq.[14]\nFarther east, Tara was founded in 1594, roughly at the border of the taiga belt (to the north) and the steppe to the south.[15]\n\n\nIn the 17th century the Dzungar Khanate, formed by the Mongol Oirat people, became Russia's southern neighbor, and controlled the upper Irtysh.[16] As a result of Russia's confrontation with the Dzungars in the Peter the Great's era,[17] the Russians founded the cities of Omsk in 1716, Semipalatinsk in 1718, Ust-Kamenogorsk in 1720, and Petropavlovsk in 1752.\n\n\nThe Chinese Qing Empire conquered Dzungaria in the 1750s. This prompted an increase in the Russian authorities' attention to their borderland; in 1756, the Orenburg Governor Ivan Neplyuyev even proposed the annexation of the Lake Zaysan region, but this project was forestalled by Chinese successes.[18] Concerns were raised in Russia (1759) about the (theoretical) possibility of a Chinese fleet sailing from Lake Zaysan down the Irtysh and into Western Siberia. A Russian expedition visited Lake Zaysan in 1764, and concluded that such a riverine invasion would not be likely. Nonetheless, a chain of Russian pickets was established on the Bukhtarma River, north of Lake Zaysan.[19] Thus the border between the two empires in the Irtysh basin became roughly delineated, with a (sparse) chain of guard posts on both sides.\n\n\nThe situation in the borderlands in the mid-19th century is described in a report by A. Abramof (ru; 1865). Even though the Zaysan region was recognized by both parties as part of the Qing empire, it had been annually used, by fishing expeditions sent by the Siberian Cossack Host. The summer expeditions started in 1803, and in 1822\u201325 their range was expanded through the entire Lake Zaysan and to the mouth of the Black Irtysh. Through the mid-19th century, the Qing presence on the upper Irtysh was mostly limited to the annual visit of the Qing *amban* from Chuguchak to one of the Cossacks' fishing stations (*Batavski Piket*).[20]\n\n\nThe border between the Russian and the Qing empires in the Irtysh basin was established along the line fairly similar to China's modern border with Russia and Kazakhstan by the Convention of Peking of 1860.[21] The actual border line pursuant to the convention was drawn by the Protocol of Chuguchak (1864), leaving Lake Zaysan on the Russian side.[22][23] The Qing empire's military presence in the Irtysh basin crumbled during the 1862\u201377 Dungan Revolt. After the fall of the rebellion and the reconquest of Xinjiang by Zuo Zongtang, the border between the Russian and the Qing empires in the Irtysh basin was further slightly readjusted, in Russia's favor, by the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881).\n\n\n\n## Cultural references[edit]\n\n\nThe Irtysh River serves as a backdrop in the epilogue of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's 1866 novel *Crime and Punishment*.
