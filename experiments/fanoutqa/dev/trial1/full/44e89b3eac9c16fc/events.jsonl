Some Pokémon in this generation were introduced in animated adaptations of the franchise before *Gold* and *Silver*, such as Ho-Oh in the first episode of the *Pokémon* anime series in 1998 and 1999, Togepi, which was a recurring character in the anime owned by Misty, Donphan in the Pokémon first movie in 1998, Snubbull in the first Pikachu short movie in 1998, and Marill, which also debuted in that short film and was a recurring character in the anime owned by Tracey Sketchit in 1998 and 1999. Elekid, Bellossom, Ledyba, and Hoothoot debuted in Pikachu's Rescue Adventure and Lugia and Slowking debuted in Pokémon 2000.\n\n\nThe following list details the 100 Pokémon of Generation II in order of their National Pokédex number. The first Pokémon, Chikorita, is number 152 and the last, Celebi, is number 251. Alternate forms that result in type changes are included for convenience. Mega evolutions and regional forms are included on the pages for the generation in which they were introduced.\n\n\n\n\n## Table of Dexes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Dex name | No. of Pokemon in Dex | No. in National Dex | percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Johto Dex [Gold, Silver and Crystal]\n | 251\n | 251\n | 100%  100%\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n |\n\n\n## Design and development[edit]\n\n\nTwo new types were introduced in *Pokémon Gold* and *Silver* – namely the \"Dark\" and \"Steel\" types – which were intended to better balance the gameplay of Pokémon battles. Dark and Steel types fare well against \"Psychic\" attacks, which was a dominant type in *Red* and *Blue*. The concept of breeding was introduced in the second generation of *Pokémon* games as well, which allows players to manipulate the skills of their Pokémon to a greater degree.[1] Some of the new Pokémon introduced in *Gold* and *Silver* are pre-evolutions of other Pokémon, such as Pichu and Igglybuff. These baby Pokémon are only available by breeding their evolved forms.\n\n\n*Pokémon Gold* and *Silver* were first revealed at Nintendo Space World in 1997. At this point, the game had a massively larger world map than the final game and this prototype featured around 40 Pokémon designs that were removed and replaced when the games were released in 1999.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## List of Pokémon[edit]\n\n\nPokémon\n\n* Chikorita\n* Bayleef\n* Meganium\n* Cyndaquil\n* Quilava\n* Typhlosion\n* Totodile\n* Croconaw\n* Feraligatr\n* Sentret\n* Furret\n* Hoothoot\n* Noctowl\n* Ledyba\n* Ledian\n* Spinarak\n* Ariados\n* Crobat\n* Chinchou\n* Lanturn\n* Pichu\n* Cleffa\n* Igglybuff\n* Togepi\n* Togetic\n* Natu\n* Xatu\n* Mareep\n* Flaaffy\n* Ampharos\n* Bellossom\n* Marill\n* Azumarill\n* Sudowoodo\n* Politoed\n* Hoppip\n* Skiploom\n* Jumpluff\n* Aipom\n* Sunkern\n* Sunflora\n* Yanma\n* Wooper\n* Quagsire\n* Espeon\n* Umbreon\n* Murkrow\n* Slowking\n* Misdreavus\n* Unown\n* Wobbuffet\n* Girafarig\n* Pineco\n* Forretress\n* Dunsparce\n* Gligar\n* Steelix\n* Snubbull\n* Granbull\n* Qwilfish\n* Scizor\n* Shuckle\n* Heracross\n* Sneasel\n* Teddiursa\n* Ursaring\n* Slugma\n* Magcargo\n* Swinub\n* Piloswine\n* Corsola\n* Remoraid\n* Octillery\n* Delibird\n* Mantine\n* Skarmory\n* Houndour\n* Houndoom\n* Kingdra\n* Phanpy\n* Donphan\n* Porygon2\n* Stantler\n* Smeargle\n* Tyrogue\n* Hitmontop\n* Smoochum\n* Elekid\n* Magby\n* Miltank\n* Blissey\n* Raikou\n* Entei\n* Suicune\n* Larvitar\n* Pupitar\n* Tyranitar\n* Lugia\n* Ho-Oh\n* Celebi\n\n\n\nList of Pokémon species introduced in Generation II (1999)[nb 1]\n| Name\n | National Pokédexnumber\n | Type(s) | Evolves from\n | Evolves into\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese\n | Primary\n | Secondary\n |\n| Chikorita\n | *Chikorita* (チコリータ)[4] | 0152 | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Bayleef (#153) | A small quadrupedal green Pokémon with a large lime green leaf on its head.

Ash Ketchum has a Bayleef in the anime.\n |\n| Meganium\n | *Meganium* (メガニウム)[7] | 0154 | Grass\n | Bayleef (#153) | End of evolution\n | It is based on the *Sauropod*.

These games were accompanied by the television series Pokémon Advanced, which aired from November 1, 2002, until August 28, 2003 in Japan.\n\n\nThe following list details the 135 Pokémon of Generation III in order of their National Pokédex number. The first Pokémon, Treecko, is number 252 and the last, Deoxys, is number 386. Alternate forms that result in type changes are included for convenience. Mega evolutions and regional forms are included on the pages for the generation in which they were introduced.\n\n\n\n\n## Design and development[edit]\n\n\n*Nintendo Life* noted in a retrospective that the third generation of *Pokémon* has a very different \"feel\" from the two generations that came before it because almost all of its 135 new Pokémon – save for Azurill and Wynaut – have no relation to those of the previous generations. *Ruby* and *Sapphire* features two \"Mythical Pokémon\" – Jirachi and Deoxys – both of which became available to coincide with their respective anime movies.[1]\n\n\n*Pokémon Ruby* and *Sapphire* significantly increased the amount of \"Dark\" and \"Steel\"-type Pokémon in the series, as only a few Pokémon in previous generations used these typings. *Hardcore Gamer* also noted that many of the new Pokémon made use of \"dual typing\", where Pokémon have both a primary and a secondary type; this was not nearly as common in *Red* and *Blue* or *Gold* and *Silver*.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Table of Dexes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Dex name | No. of Pokemon in Dex | No. in National Dex | percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hoenn Dex [Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald]\n | 202\n | 386\n | 52.33%  52.33%\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n |\n| Kanto Dex [FireRed and LeafGreen]\n | 151\n | 386\n | 39.12%  39.12%\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n |\n\n\n## List of Pokémon[edit]\n\n\nPokémon\n\n* Treecko\n* Grovyle\n* Sceptile\n* Torchic\n* Combusken\n* Blaziken\n* Mudkip\n* Marshtomp\n* Swampert\n* Poochyena\n* Mightyena\n* Zigzagoon\n* Linoone\n* Wurmple\n* Silcoon\n* Beautifly\n* Cascoon\n* Dustox\n* Lotad\n* Lombre\n* Ludicolo\n* Seedot\n* Nuzleaf\n* Shiftry\n* Taillow\n* Swellow\n* Wingull\n* Pelipper\n* Ralts\n* Kirlia\n* Gardevoir\n* Surskit\n* Masquerain\n* Shroomish\n* Breloom\n* Slakoth\n* Vigoroth\n* Slaking\n* Nincada\n* Ninjask\n* Shedinja\n* Whismur\n* Loudred\n* Exploud\n* Makuhita\n* Hariyama\n* Azurill\n* Nosepass\n* Skitty\n* Delcatty\n* Sableye\n* Mawile\n* Aron\n* Lairon\n* Aggron\n* Meditite\n* Medicham\n* Electrike\n* Manectric\n* Plusle\n* Minun\n* Volbeat\n* Illumise\n* Roselia\n* Gulpin\n* Swalot\n* Carvanha\n* Sharpedo\n* Wailmer\n* Wailord\n* Numel\n* Camerupt\n* Torkoal\n* Spoink\n* Grumpig\n* Spinda\n* Trapinch\n* Vibrava\n* Flygon\n* Cacnea\n* Cacturne\n* Swablu\n* Altaria\n* Zangoose\n* Seviper\n* Lunatone\n* Solrock\n* Barboach\n* Whiscash\n* Corphish\n* Crawdaunt\n* Baltoy\n* Claydol\n* Lileep\n* Cradily\n* Anorith\n* Armaldo\n* Feebas\n* Milotic\n* Castform\n* Kecleon\n* Shuppet\n* Banette\n* Duskull\n* Dusclops\n* Tropius\n* Chimecho\n* Absol\n* Wynaut\n* Snorunt\n* Glalie\n* Spheal\n* Sealeo\n* Walrein\n* Clamperl\n* Huntail\n* Gorebyss\n* Relicanth\n* Luvdisc\n* Bagon\n* Shelgon\n* Salamence\n* Beldum\n* Metang\n* Metagross\n* Regirock\n* Regice\n* Registeel\n* Latias\n* Latios\n* Kyogre\n* Groudon\n* Rayquaza\n* Jirachi\n* Deoxys\n\n\n\nList of Pokémon species introduced in Generation III (2002)[nb 1]\n| Name\n | National Pokédexnumber\n | Type(s) | Evolves from\n | Evolves into\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese\n | Primary\n | Secondary\n |\n| Treecko\n | *Kimori* (キモリ)[4] | 0252 | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Grovyle (#253) | Treecko has claws at the bottom of its feet so it can scale walls and ceilings. It uses its thick tail to slam foes. Treecko is one of three starters of the Hoenn region.\n |\n| Grovyle\n | *Juputoru* (ジュプトル)[5] | 0253 | Grass\n | Treecko (#252) | Sceptile (#254) | Grovyle is the evolved form of Treecko. A Grovyle played a major role in the plot of the spin-off games *Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time, Darkness*, and Sky.\n |\n| Sceptile\n | *Jukain* (ジュカイン)[6] | 0254 | Grass\n | Grovyle (#253) | Mega Evolution | The final evolution of Treecko and a playable character in *Pokkén Tournament* and its counterpart. It is based on the *Dilophosaurus*. It received a Mega Evolution in *Pokémon Omega Ruby* and *Alpha Sapphire*, which gave it a secondary Dragon typing. It was the first Pokémon capable of learning Leaf Blade.\n |\n| Torchic\n | *Achamo* (アチャモ)[4] | 0255 | Fire\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Combusken (#256) | It can scorch foes black with its stomach-produced fireballs. Its English name is a portmanteau of \"torch\" and \"chick\", the latter alluding to Torchic being based on a baby chicken. During the promotion of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire in America, a special Game Boy Advance with a Torchic theme was released specifically at the New York Pokémon Center back in 2003.[7] Torchic is one of three starters from the Hoenn region. The character May used one in the *Pokémon* anime.\n |\n| Combusken\n | *Wakashamo* (ワカシャモ)[5] | 0256 | Fire\n | Fighting | Torchic (#255) | Blaziken (#257) | It can produce about 100 kicks a second. Combusken became the first of three consecutive Fire and Fighting starter evolutions, eventually ending with Emboar in Pokémon Black & White.\n |\n| Blaziken\n | *Bashāmo* (バシャーモ)[6] | 0257 | Fire\n | Fighting | Combusken (#256) | Mega Evolution | The final evolution of Torchic. It can leap high in the air and deliver amazing fiery kicks. Blaziken has received generally positive reception. IGN readers ranked Blaziken the 50th best Pokémon ever.[8] *Game Informer* ranked it the 36th best Pokémon.[9] In a poll by *Official Nintendo Magazine*'s Tom East, Blaziken was voted the third-best Fire-type Pokémon. They stated, \"A kung fu chicken? What's not to like?\". In a poll of the best Pokémon from *Ruby* and *Sapphire* in celebration of the games having 10 years under their belt, Blaziken was ranked in third place.[10] Another poll of the best Pokémon introduced in *Ruby*, *Sapphire*, and *Emerald* placed Blaziken third.[11] GamesRadar used Blaziken as an example of a human-shaped Pokémon done right.[12] The Escapist's John Funk wrote that Blaziken was an \"awesome\" example of a Pokémon that players who refused to play past *Red* and *Blue* were missing out on.[13] *Game Informer*'s Jeff Marchiafava felt that Blaziken was less cool than other Fire-type Pokémon and stated that it has a 1970s \"vibe\". While he felt that the Mega Evolution was an improvement, he called it a \"Mega Disappointment.\"[14] Kotaku's Eric Jou also felt that it had a weak design and cited it as an example of *Ruby* and *Sapphire*'s weak Pokémon designs.[15] Several critics and websites have noted that Blaziken would be a good choice for a playable character in *Super Smash Bros.*.[16][17][18] It was the first Pokémon capable of knowing Blaze Kick. It received an Ability called Speed Boost in Generation 5, which caused it to be banned to the 'Ubers' tier in the Smogon Competitive Scene.\n |\n| Mudkip\n | *Mizugorō* (ミズゴロウ)[4] | 0258 | Water\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Marshtomp (#259) | The fin on its head acts as a radar for its surroundings. Even in muddy water, Mudkip can sense where it is going. Videos, images and copypastas involving Mudkip began surfacing in 2005, and by 2007, the Pokémon, along with variations of the misspelt phrase \"so i herd u liek mudkipz\", have become internet memes,[19][20] receiving many tribute videos on YouTube.[21] Mudkip is one of three starters from the Hoenn region.\n |\n| Marshtomp\n | *Numakurō* (ヌマクロー)[5] | 0259 | Water\n | Ground\n | Mudkip (#258) | Swampert (#260) | Marshtomp is the evolved form of Mudkip, and gains a secondary Ground typing upon evolution. It was used by the character Brock in the *Pokémon* anime, evolving from a Mudkip.\n |\n| Swampert\n | *Ragurāji* (ラグラージ)[6] | 0260 | Water\n | Ground\n | Marshtomp (#259) | Mega Evolution | Swampert is the final stage of the Mudkip evolution line. They are said to be strong enough that they can swim while towing a large ship, and its arms are hard as rock. It gained a Mega Evolution in *Pokémon Omega Ruby* and *Alpha Sapphire*. It was the first Pokémon capable of knowing Muddy Water.\n |\n| Poochyena\n | *Pochiena* (ポチエナ)[5] | 0261 | Dark | Beginning of evolution\n | Mightyena (#262) | It is based on the hyena. It is the first Generation III Pokémon to be a pure Dark type and the second after Umbreon. Its English name is a portmanteau of \"pooch\" and \"hyena\". Poochyena and its evolved form are frequent Pokémon in their debut games, being frequently used by both villainous teams Team Magma and Team Aqua.\n |\n| Mightyena\n | *Guraena* (グラエナ)[22] | 0262 | Dark | Poochyena (#261) | End of evolution\n | In the wild, Mightyena live in a pack. They never defy their leader's orders. They defeat foes with perfectly coordinated teamwork. Its English name is a portmanteau of \"mighty\" and \"hyena\". It and its pre-evolved form are frequently used by the aforementioned villainous teams Team Magma and Team Aqua with high frequency.\n |\n| Zigzagoon\n | *Jiguzaguma* (ジグザグマ)[5] | 0263 | Normal\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Linoone (#264) | It is interested in everything and walks in a zigzag pattern. In Generation VIII, it gained a new Galarian form, adding a Dark type on top of its Normal type. Its English name is a portmanteau of \"zigzag\" and \"goon\".\n |\n| Linoone\n | *Massuguma* (マッスグマ)[23] | 0264 | Normal\n | Zigzagoon (#263) | End of evolution[nb 2] | It has trouble with gently curving turns since it goes in straight lines. In Generation VIII, it gained a new Galarian form and a Dark type on top of its Normal type. This new form can evolve, unlike its base counterpart.\n |\n| Wurmple\n | *Kemusso* (ケムッソ)[24] | 0265 | Bug\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Silcoon (#266)Cascoon (#268) | It likes the bark off of trees that it pries off with its two stingers. Wurmple will evolve into either Cascoon or Silcoon according to unseen personality values, making its evolution essentially random.\n |\n| Silcoon\n | *Karasarisu* (カラサリス)[23] | 0266 | Bug\n | Wurmple (#265) | Beautifly (#267) | It anchors itself to tree branches using silk and awaits for its own evolution. Silcoon is virtually identical to its counterpart Cascoon, having the same moves and stats as it.\n |\n| Beautifly\n | *Agehanto* (アゲハント)[6] | 0267 | Bug\n | Flying\n | Silcoon (#266) | End of evolution\n | Its favourite food is nectar. Its English name is a portmanteau of \"beauty\" and \"butterfly\". Beautifly was notably used by May in the *Pokémon* anime.\n |\n| Cascoon\n | *Mayurudo* (マユルド)[23] | 0268 | Bug\n | Wurmple (#265) | Dustox (#269) | It attaches dead leaves to its body as camouflage to disguise itself from predators. It is a counterpart of Silcoon, the only difference being its purple hue and eyes.\n |\n| Dustox\n | *Dokukeiru* (ドクケイル)[23] | 0269 | Bug\n | Poison | Cascoon (#268) | End of evolution\n | It is attracted to light, and can strip forests clean. It is considered an alternative version of Beautifly. The character Jessie of Team Rocket uses it in the *Pokémon* anime, before its eventual departure in *Crossing Paths*.\n |\n| Lotad\n | *Hasubō* (ハスボー)[25] | 0270 | Water\n | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Lombre (#271) | Lotad's evolution line is based on Spanish names. In *Pokémon Colosseum* and *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*, multiple Ludicolo are used on the team of the main antagonist, Miror B. A Ludicolo used by Toler Webb was distributed at the Pokémon Spring Regional Championships 2013 as an Event Pokémon. Brock, a character in the *Pokémon* anime, also used a Ludicolo, having evolved from a Lotad and into a Lombre before reaching its final form.\n |\n| Lombre\n | *Hasuburero* (ハスブレロ)[26] | 0271 | Water\n | Grass\n | Lotad (#270) | Ludicolo (#272) |\n| Ludicolo\n | *Runpappa* (ルンパッパ)[27] | 0272 | Water\n | Grass\n | Lombre (#271) | End of evolution\n |\n| Seedot\n | *Tanebō* (タネボー)[23] | 0273 | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Nuzleaf (#274) | It hangs off branches and absorbs nutrients.

Alex Carlson of *Hardcore Gamer* wrote in 2014 that the third generation of *Pokémon* games was not well received by fans of the series, with some people calling the generation the \"worst in the series history\".[2] This was in part because *Ruby* and *Sapphire* did not allow players to transfer in their Pokémon from previous generations and, because of this, many older Pokémon were completely unavailable in the games until *Pokémon FireRed* and *LeafGreen* were released a few years later.[60] Meanwhile, many of the new Pokémon designs, such as those for Torchic, Feebas, Luvdisc, Castform and Clamperl, were criticised for being unoriginal.[2][60][61] Contrastingly, some designs, including Breloom, Aggron, and the aforementioned Castform were praised for their coolness, with the large variety of unique legendary Pokémon also helping the third generation feel fresh and new.[62] While *Ruby* and *Sapphire* were recognized for introducing less memorable designs than their predecessors, designs like Milotic, Salamence, Metagross, Rayquaza, and Blaziken made the overall generation a satisfying supplement to the existing Pokédex.[63]\n\n\nThe third generation has had its share of enduringly popular designs. Eighteen years after the release of *Ruby* and *Sapphire*, Rayquaza and Gardevoir finished eighth and ninth in 2020's Pokémon of the Year vote,[64] with Flygon, Sceptile, and Blaziken also among the top 30.[65] Rayquaza also finished eighth in a 2016 Japanese poll, with Jirachi and Kyogre among the top 25.[66] A popularity vote on the Pokémon subreddit featured Blaziken at 5th, joined in the top 25 by Gardevoir, Absol, Flygon, and Mudkip.[67]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Details on Pokémon names, National Pokédex numbers, types and evolutions are obtained from The Pokémon Company International's online Pokédex.[3]\n2. **^** Only Galarian Linoone (introduced in *Pokémon Sword* and *Shield*) are capable of evolving into Obstagoon.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Starting in *X* and *Y*, Ralts, Kirlia, Gardevoir, Azurill and Mawile all gained the Fairy type.\n4. **^** Only male Kirlia are capable of evolving into Gallade.
