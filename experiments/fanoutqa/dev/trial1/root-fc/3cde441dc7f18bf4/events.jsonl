The first official census took place in 1872. From that year, every 8 years (with some exceptions) the population is counted. The Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica has postponed the next census until 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[10]\n\n\nBrazil is the seventh most populated country in the world.\n\n\n\n* **1550** – 15,000\n* **1600** – 100,000\n* **1660** – 184,000\n* **1700** – 300,000\n* **1766** – 1,500,000\n* **1800** – 3,250,000\n* **1820** – 4,717,000\n* **1850** – 7,256,000\n* **1872** – 9,930,478\n* **1890** – 14,333,915\n* **1900** – 17,438,434\n* **1920** – 30,635,605\n* **1940** – 41,236,315\n* **1950** – 51,944,397\n* **1960** – 70,119,071\n* **1970** – 93,139,037\n* **1980** – 119,070,865\n* **1991** – 146,917,459\n* **1996** – 157,079,573\n* **2000** – 169,544,443\n* **2010** – 192,755,799[11]\n* **2022** – 203,062,512[12]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Brazilian states by population\nPopulation distribution in Brazil is very uneven.

The highest rate was in Acre, with 1.98 children per woman. Other regions with high fertility include Amapá, with 1.87 children per woman, Amazonas, 1.85 in Roraima, 1.84, in Maranhão, 1.82, and Pará, 1.79.\n\n\nOn the other hand, São Paulo is the state with the lowest rate, 1.26 children per woman. Other states with low fertility include Santa Catarina, with 1.28, Rio Grande do Sul, 1.3, in Rio de Janeiro, 1.32 in Paraná and Minas Gerais, 1.33.\n\n\nRegarding race of mothers, between 2015 and 2021, the fertility rate of all racial groups fell below replacement rate. Black fertility fell from 2.01 to 1.76, Pardo/Mixed fertility fell from 1.95 to 1.73 and white fertility fell from 1.90 to 1.55. There was no information regarding Asian fertility rates. Indigenous fertility was calculated at 1.87 children per women in 2010.[22]\n\n\n\n### Childlessness and education[edit]\n\n\nThe color or race of the woman and the level of education has also shown to influence the fact of not having children. In 2013, among white women aged 15 to 55 years, 41.5% had no children, while among black and brown women, the percentage was 35.8%.\n\n\nThe proportional difference is even greater among white women compared to black and brown 25–29 years.

Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of largest cities in Brazil and Largest Cities of Northeast Region, Brazil\nIn Brazil, most important cities are on the coast or close to it. State capitals are also, commonly, the largest city of their states. Notable exceptions to this are Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina.\n\n\nThere are also non-capital metropolitan areas, for example, in São Paulo state (Campinas, Santos, Paraíba Valley, Sorocaba, Ribeirão Preto and Franca), Minas Gerais (Steel Valley), Rio Grande do Sul (Sinos Valley), and Santa Catarina (Itajaí Valley), amongst others.\n\n\nSão Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are far larger than any other Brazilian cities. São Paulo's influence in most economic aspects can be noted in a national (and even international) scale; Rio de Janeiro – partially due to its former status as the national capital – still host various large corporations' headquarters, besides being Brazil's cultural center with respect to film production and other such televised media. Brasília, the capital of Brazil, is its 3rd biggest city.\n\n\n\n## Migration[edit]\n\n\n### Summary[edit]\n\n\nThe United Nations reported in the International Migration Stock that 64 countries had significant emigration or immigration with Brazil in 2020.[26][27] The Migration Policy Institute defines significant migration if 1,000+ people are in the emigration or/and migration group.[28] Venezuela, Haiti, Portugal, Bolivia, and Uruguay have the most positive net migration, while the United States, Japan, Spain, Italy, and France have the most negative net migration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|

etc. Brazil has received the third largest number of immigrants in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\nBrazil's structure, legislation and settlement policies for arriving immigrants were much less organized than in Canada and the United States at the time. Nevertheless, an Immigrant Inn (*Hospedaria dos Imigrantes*) was built in 1886 in São Paulo, and quick admittance and recording routines for the throngs of immigrants arriving by ship at the seaports of Vitória, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Paranaguá, Florianópolis and Porto Alegre were established. The São Paulo State alone processed more than 2.5 million immigrants in its almost 100 years of continuous operation. People of more than 70 different nationalities were recorded.\n\n\nFollowing the trend of several other countries in the Americas, which encouraged immigration from many countries, Brazil quickly became a melting pot of races and nationalities, but being peculiar in the sense of having the highest degree of intermarriage in the world. Immigrants found a strong social and cultural tolerance toward inter-racial marriage, including large numbers of Mulattoes (European and African), Caboclos (Indian and European) and mixed European, African and Indian people, though it was not accompanied by an entire lack of racism. Correspondingly, the same mentality reflected in low psychological and social barriers regarding intermarriage between Europeans, Middle Easterners and Asians of several origins, as well as between people of different religions.\n\n\n\n### History of immigration[edit]\n\n\nIt is postulated that the Americas were settled by three migratory waves from Northern Asia. The Native Brazilians are thought to descend from the first wave of migrants, who arrived in the region around 9000 BC. The main Native Brazilian groups are the Tupi-Guarani, the Jê, the Arawaks and the Caraibas (Kalina or Caribs). The Tupi-Guarani nation, originally from the Paraná river basin and also one of the largest of the Native-Paraguayan nations, had spread all along the Brazilian coastline from South to North and came to be known by the Portuguese as \"Os Índios da Língua Geral\" (\"The Indians of the General Language\"); the Jê nation occupied most of the interior of the country from Maranhão to Santa Catarina. The Arawaks and the Caribs, the last ones to get in contact with the Portuguese, lived in the North and Northwest of Brazil.\n\n\nThe European immigration to Brazil started in the 16th century, with the vast majority of them coming from Portugal. In the first two centuries of colonization, 100,000 Portuguese arrived in Brazil (around 500 colonists per year). In the 18th century, 600,000 Portuguese arrived (6,000 per year).[29] The first region to be settled by the Portuguese was Northeastern Brazil, followed by the Southeast region. The original Amerindian population of Brazil (between two and five million) largely died from disease or violence or was assimilated into the Portuguese population.[30] The Mamelucos (or Caboclos, a mixed race between Europeans and Amerindians) have always been present in many parts of Brazil.\n\n\nAnother important ethnic group, Africans, first arrived as slaves. Many came from Guinea-Bissau, or from West African countries – by the end of the eighteenth century many had been taken from the Kingdom of Kongo and modern-day Angola, Congo, Mozambique, Benin and Nigeria. By the time of the end of the slave trade in 1850, around six million slaves had been brought to Brazil–50% of all slave traffic between Africa and the Americas. Nowadays, there are still small immigration waves coming from the African continent.\nThe largest influx of European immigrants to Brazil occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to the *Memorial do Imigrante* statistics data, Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953.[31][32]\n\n\nThese immigrants were divided in two groups: a part of them was sent to Southern Brazil to work as small farmers. However, the biggest part of the immigrants was sent to Southeast Brazil to work in the coffee plantations. The immigrants sent to Southern Brazil were mainly Germans (starting in 1824, mainly from Rhineland-Palatinate, Pomerania, Hamburg, Westphalia, etc.) Italians (starting in 1875, mainly from the Veneto and Lombardia), Austrians, Poles, Ukrainians, Dutch and Russians. In the South, the immigrants established rural communities that retain a cultural connection with their ancestral homelands. In Southeast Brazil, most of the immigrants were Italians (mainly from the Veneto, Campania, Calabria and Lombardia), Portuguese (mainly from Beira Alta, Minho and Alto Trás-os-Montes), Dutch, Spaniards (mainly from Galicia and Andalusia), Lithuanians, French, Hungarians and Ashkenazi Jews.\n\n\nNotably, the first half of the 20th century saw a large inflow of Japanese (mainly from Honshū, Hokkaidō and Okinawa) and Levantine Christians from Lebanon (and few from Syria). These Christian Levantine immigrants were wrongly called \"Turks\" by many Brazilians because their original countries were still under Ottoman rule back in the period when their immigration to Brazil began. The number of actual Turks who immigrated to Brazil was in fact very small. Chinese, Taiwanese and Koreans influx became common after the 1950s.\n\n\n\n### IBGE's 1998 PME[edit]\n\n\nOn the other hand, in 1998, the IBGE, within its preparation for the 2000 census, experimentally introduced a question about \"origem\" (origin/ancestry) in its \"Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego\" (Monthly Employment Research), to test the viability of introducing that variable in the census[33]: 3 (the IBGE ended by deciding against the inclusion of questions about it in the census). This research interviewed about 90,000 people in six metropolitan regions (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, and Recife).[34] To this day, it remains the only actual published survey about the immigrant origin of Brazilians.\n\n\nHere are its results:[35]\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazilian Population, by ancestry, 1998[33]\n| Ancestry | %\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Brazil](image) \"Brazilian\" | 86.09%\n |\n| ![Portugal](image) Portuguese | 10.46%\n |\n| ![Italy](image) Italian | 10.41%\n |\n| Indigenous | 6.64%\n |\n| Black | 5.09%\n |\n| ![Spain](image) Spanish | 4.40%\n |\n| ![Germany](image) German | 3.54%\n |\n| African | 2.06%\n |\n| ![Japan](image) Japanese | 1.34%\n |\n| ![Lebanon](image)![Syria](image) Lebanese/Syrian | 0.48%\n |\n| Jewish | 0.20%\n |\n| Others | 2.81%\n |\n| Total | 133.52%\n |\n\n\nNotice that the total is higher than 100% because of multiple answers. Many Brazilians are unaware of their ancestry, especially those of old immigration, due to this the high number who declared themselves only as Brazilians.\n\n\n\n### Emigration[edit]\n\n\nIn the second half of the 1980s, Brazilians from various socioeconomic backgrounds started to emigrate to other countries in search of better economic opportunities.\n\n\nBy the 1990s, nearly 1.9 million Brazilians were living outside the country, mainly in the United States, Paraguay and Japan,[36] but also in Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Israel. Despite the surge in the phenomenon, there were no specific policies implemented by the government to encourage or discourage this emigration process.[37] Thanks to the favourable outlook of the Brazilian economy and due to the crisis that hit countries such as Japan, Portugal or the United States, emigration of Brazilian citizens stagnated - with many returning to their home country - until 2011, when 1,898,762 Brazilians were living abroad.\n\n\nThe 2000 Brazilian census provides some information about the high number of migrants returning to Brazil. For instance, of those who reported residing in another country less than 10 years before the 2000 census, 66.9 percent were Brazilians. If only the returning migrants (former Brazilian immigrants) are considered, 26.8 percent of Brazilians came from Paraguay, 17 percent came from Japan, and 15.8 percent came from the United States.[37]\n\n\nAs political unrest, increasing violence, inflation, soaring unemployment rates and an economic crisis hit Brazil, millions of citizens moved abroad starting in 2011, generating the largest emigration process ever witnessed in Brazilian history, since Brazil has historically been a land of immigrants. In 2021 more than 4.4 million Brazilians live abroad,[38] this is an increase of around 132% compared to the previous 10 years.\n\n\nThe largest Brazilian community abroad - comprising almost half of the diaspora - is the one in the US, where around 2,000,000 Brazilians live; they are present especially in Florida. Almost 300,000 Brazilians - hence 6.8% of all Brazilians living abroad - lived in other Portuguese-speaking countries (94% in Portugal). In the same year around 680,000 Brazilians - hence 15.5% of the Brazilian diaspora - lived in Spanish-speaking countries, with the majority found in neighbouring countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\n\nOther major communities are found in countries such as the UK (220,000 Brazilians in 2021), Canada (122,500 Brazilians in 2021) Ireland (70,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Australia (60,000 Brazilians in 2021).\n\n\nThere are also noticeable Brazilian communities in countries once source of immigrants such as Japan (210,000 Brazilians in 2021), Italy (162,000 Brazilians in 2021), Germany (140,000 Brazilians in 2021), the Netherlands (65,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Lebanon (21,000 Brazilians in 2021). Many of the Brazilians found in these countries are descendants of the early immigrants who came to Brazil in the early 1900s.\n\n\nThere is also a sizeable Brazilian community in France (172,000 Brazilians in 2021), almost equally split between Metropolitan France and French Guyana.\n\n\n\n## Racial composition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n\n![](image)Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has Italian ancestry\n![](image)Italian regional immigration to Brazil, which has the most people of Italian origin outside Italy. Unlike other countries with Italian immigrants, Brazil prioritized Northern Italy which it considered more developed\n![](image)German colonies in Southern BrazilThe bulk of the Brazilian population descends from three main source populations (either alone, or more commonly, in varying combinations mixed in varying degrees); early European settlers (chiefly ethnic Portuguese, but also Portuguese New Christians of ethnic Sephardic Jewish origin forced to convert to Christianity),[39] sub-Saharan Africans (Yoruba, Ewe, Akan, Bantu, and others), and the indigenous peoples in Brazil (mostly Tupi and Guarani, but also many other indigenous Brazilian ethnic groups).\n\n\nStarting in the late 19th century, Brazil received substantial post-colonial immigration from several other regions, mainly from peoples of what are now the countries of Italy, Germany, Spain, Poland, as well as Middle-Eastern Christians from the Levant (mostly from what is now Lebanon, and less so from Syria), Ukraine, Japan, China and Korea.\n\n\nJews in Brazil are a small but sizable population,[40][41] and they include mostly Ashkenazi Jews (who also arrived with the post-colonial contingent of European migration),[42] a smaller proportion of Sephardi Jews (mostly Eastern Sephardim arrived with the contingent of post-colonial immigrants from Syria and Lebanon, but also North African Sephardim from Morocco settled in the Amazon, and Western Sephardim arrived with the Dutch), and to a much lesser extent Mizrahi Jews.\n\n\nOverall, the small but sizable Brazilian Jewish community is concentrated especially in São Paulo,[43] Rio de Janeiro[44] and Porto Alegre,[45] and they are accounted for without Brazilian descendants of Portuguese \"New Christians\" (ethnic Sephardic Jews forced to convert to Christianity and arrived with the ethnic Portuguese during the colonial period),[42] which if included would inflate the Jewish origin population in Brazil considerably. By themselves, Brazilian descendants of Portuguese \"New Christians\" are estimated to account for a figure anywhere between hundreds of thousands to several million.\n\n\nThe descendants of European immigrants, particularly the Germans, Italians, Austrians, Swiss, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Dutch, Lithuanians, Scandinavians, Russians, Hungarians, Finns and Luxembourgers are mainly concentrated in the southern part of the country, in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, and the most populous, São Paulo; these states have a wide majority of citizens of European descent.[46][47]\nSão Paulo alone has the largest population in absolute numbers with 30 million Europeans.[48]\n\n\nIn the rest of the country, part of the European-Brazilian population is of colonial Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish and French settler stock, especially in the Northeast. In the mid-southern states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul and in the Federal District, the number of Europeans (European and Levantine phenotype) revolves around 50% of the population or above, being close to the proportion of people of Mixed-race Brazilians, and other minorities like Black Brazilians and East Asian Brazilians.[49]\n\n\nIn the Northeast, which received large masses of African slaves to work in sugarcane, tobacco and cotton plantations, people of African and mixed-race descent predominate, mostly on the coast, whereas in the semi-arid country land (usually called *sertão*) there is a predominance of Europeans and Amerindian-European mixed people. Most of the African or mulatto people in the *sertão* are descended from freed African slaves or mulattos who fled inland from the coast and worked as cowboys for semi-feudal lords.\n\n\nThe city of Salvador da Bahia is considered one of the largest African cities of the world. In the Northwest (covering largely the Brazilian Amazon), a great part of the population has distinguishable ethnic characteristics that emphasize their Amerindian roots. Other ethnic groups have merged with the Indigenous tribes there. This region is not densely populated, and \"caboclos\", people of mixed native and European descent, are a small part of the entire Brazilian population.\n\n\nThe Japanese are the largest Asian group in Brazil. In fact, Brazil has the largest population of Japanese ancestry outside Japan, with 1.8 million Japanese Brazilians, most of them living in São Paulo. Some Chinese and Korean also settled Brazil. Most Chinese came from mainland China, but others came from Taiwan and Hong Kong, and also from Portuguese-speaking Macau—these Chinese from Macau could speak and understand Portuguese, and it was not hard for them to adjust to Brazilian life.\n\n\nThose immigrant populations and their descendants still retain some of their original ethnic identity; however, they are not closed communities and are rapidly integrating into mainstream Brazilian society: for instance, very few of the third generation can understand their grandparents' languages.\n\n\n\n### European-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: European Brazilians\n\nAccording to the 2020 census, there were more than 104 million European-Brazilians, comprising 48% of Brazil's population.[50] European-Brazilians are defined as people who are solely or mostly descended from European immigrants, although most Brazilians have some degree of European ancestry. Europeans are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although they are most concentrated in the south and southeastern parts of the country. \n[51][52]\n\n\nA survey conducted in 1998 by the Minas Gerais sociologist Simon Schwartzman interviewed about 34 million Brazilians, of whom nearly 20 million declared themselves white. Asked the ethnic origin of the participants of white race, a plurality pointed only Brazilian origin (53%).\n\n\nMore than half, however, managed to point to a foreign origin: 17.2% indicated Portuguese ancestry, 16.50% Italian, 9.42% Spanish, 6.51% German and 12.32% other origins, which include Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Lithuanian, Dutch, Austrian, Swiss, French, Hungarian, Norwegian, partial distant African, indigenous, British, American Confederate, Jewish (mostly Ashkenazi, but also Sephardi including Jews from Morocco and Egypt) and Christian Levantine (Lebanese).[53][54]\n\n\nNearly one million Europeans had arrived in Brazil by 1800; most of them colonists from Portugal. An immigration boom occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries, when nearly six million Europeans emigrated to Brazil, most of them Portuguese, Germans, Italians and Spaniards.\n\n\nMany European-Brazilians have some Amerindian and/or African ancestry (similarly found in European-Americans[55] and European-Argentines).[56] It is estimated that 75% of all Brazilians have varying degrees of Portuguese ancestry.\n\n\nNowadays, European-Brazilians come from a very diverse background, which includes:\n\n\n\n* The Dutch were among the Europeans settling in Brazil during the 17th century. From 1630 to 1654, the Dutch controlled the northeast coast of Brazil, establishing their colonial capital in Recife. During the 19th and 20th century, immigrants from the Netherlands populated the central and southern states of Brazil.[57][58] The first Dutch immigrants to South America after its independence waves from their metropoles went to the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo between 1858 and 1862, where they founded the settlement of Holanda, a colony of 500 mainly Reformed folk from West Zeelandic Flanders in the Dutch province of Zeeland.[59] Dutch and other Low Franconian languages are still spoken in São Paulo (state), especially Holambra (named after Holland-America-Brazil), famous for its tulips and the annual Expoflora event, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and around Ponta Grossa, Castrolanda and Carambeí known as little Holland, in the plains of Paraná, headquarters of several food companies and a dairy farming region.[60][61]\n* The first Germans and Austrians arrived in Brazil in 1824. Most of them established themselves in rural communities across Southern Brazil, such as São Leopoldo, Novo Hamburgo, Blumenau and Pomerode. In Santa Catarina state, Southern Brazil, Germans and Austrians represented over 45% of all immigrants arriving, and in the entire country, citizens who descend from German-speaking nationalities, including Swiss and Luxemburger, but also Volga German, may represent as much as 8% of the absolute population, since Brazil is home to the second largest German-Austrian population outside their respective nations, after the USA. And German is the second most spoken mother tongue in the country.[62][63][64] According to Ethnologue, Standard German is spoken by 1.5 million people and Brazilian German encompass assorted dialects, including Riograndenser Hunsrückisch spoken by over 3 million Brazilians.[60][65][66]\n* Italians started arriving in Brazil in 1875, making up the main group of immigrants in the late 19th century.[67] First they settled in rural communities across Southern Brazil. In the early 20th century, they mostly settled in the coffee plantations in the Southeast, later moving to São Paulo capital to work in factories or starting their own businesses in trade, services and industry like businessman and industrialist count Francesco Matarazzo. In São Paulo, which came to be labeled an \"Italian city\" in the early twentieth century, Italians engaged mainly in the incipient industry and urban services activities. They came to represent 60% of the 60,000 workers employed in São Paulo factories in 1901.[68] 11% of Brazilians or 20 million citizens are of Italian extraction, possibly the largest number outside of Italy itself, most of them descended from Northern Italians, reason why Talian, or the Venetian dialect, is the third most spoken mother tongue in the nation.[69][70]\n* Poles came in significant numbers to Brazil after 1870. Most of them settled in the State of Paraná, working as small farmers.\n* Portuguese Most Brazilians are fully or partly of Portuguese ancestry. Portuguese settlers began arriving in 1500. Immigration increased during the 18th century and reached its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Lusitanian immigration never ceased throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Portuguese people in diaspora settled in Brazil especially during the 1970s coming from former Portuguese colonies like Macau or Angola after its independence. The Portuguese were always the largest ethnic group of immigrants to Brazil. In the early years of Portuguese colonization it is estimated that between 1500 and 1800 some 600,000 Portuguese immigrated to Brazil, and then between 1800 and 1980 another 600,000, then from 1980 to the present, 600,000 more. Portuguese immigration to Brazil will always be a constant, hence, will always comprise the largest percentage of European immigrants. By 2030, there will be an estimated 1,000,000 Portuguese total immigrants in Brazil as of 1980, significantly dwarfing all of the other immigrant groups. An additional figure of 1.2 million Portuguese arrived between 1951 and 1975 to settle mostly in the Southeast.[71] Nowadays, Lusitanians (Portuguese) constitute the biggest group of foreigners living in the country, with over 700,000 Portuguese nationals currently living in Brazil.[72] The vast majority arrived in the last decade. The first semester of 2011 solely had an increase of 52 thousand Portuguese nationals applying for a permanent residence visa while another large group was granted Brazilian citizenship.[73][74]\n* Spaniards came in large numbers to Brazil, starting in the late 19th century. Most of them were attracted to work in the coffee plantations in the state of São Paulo. An estimated 15 million Brazilians are of direct Spanish descent.[75]\n* Ukrainians came mostly in the late 19th century. Currently they number approximately 980,000, most of whom live in a compact settlement in south central Paraná.[76]\n\n\nSee also: Dutch Brazilian, German Brazilian, Italian Brazilian, Polish Brazilian, Portuguese Brazilian, Spanish Brazilian, and Ukrainian Brazilian\n\n### Mixed-race/Pardo-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pardo Brazilians\n\nThe Pardos can be a mixture of Europeans, Levantine, Crypto-Jews or Anusim, Africans, Amerindians, Roma and Asians. Brazil does not have a category for multiracial people, but a Pardo (brown) one, which may include caboclos, mulatos, cafuzos (local ethnonyms for people of noticeable mixed European and Amerindian, African and European, and Amerindian and African descent, i.e., mestizos, mulattoes and zambos, respectively), the multiracial result of their intermixing (despite most of European and African Brazilians possessing some degree of race-mixing, since brownness in Brazil is a matter of phenotype) and assimilated, westernized indigenous people.[77][78]\n\n\nThe Pardos make up 43.13% or 82.3 million people of Brazil's population. Multiracial Brazilians live in the entire territory of Brazil. Although, according to DNA resources, most Brazilians possess some degree of mixed-race ancestry, less than 45% of the country's population classified themselves as being part of this group due to phenotype.[79]\n\n\nThe caboclo or mestiço population, those whose ancestry is Native and European, revolves around 43 million people or 21% of the population. Genetic studies conducted by the geneticist Sergio D.J. Pena of the Federal University of Minas Gerais have shown that the caboclo population is made of individuals whose DNA ranges from 70% to 90% European (mostly Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, French or Italian 1500s to 1700s male settlers) with the remaining percentage spanning different Indigenous markers.\n\n\nSimilar DNA tests showed that people self-classified as mulatto or European and African mix, span from 62% to 83% European (mostly descendants of Portuguese, Dutch and French settlers during the colonial period in the Northeast). The pardo category in Brazil also includes 800 thousand Roma people, most of them coming from Portugal but also different countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. Eurasians can also be classified as pardo. The majority of them consisting of Ainoko or Hafu, individuals of Japanese and European ancestry.\n\n\nResearch has suggested that Asians from the early Portuguese Eastern Empire, known as Luso-Asians first came to Brazil during the sixteenth century as seamen known as Lascars, or as servants, slaves and concubines accompanying the governors, merchants and clergy who has served in Portuguese Asia.[80] This first presence of Asians was limited to Northeast Brazil, especially Bahia, but others were brought as cultivators, textile workers and miners to Pará and other parts of the Northeast.\n\n\n\n### African-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Afro-Brazilians\n\nAfrican-Brazilians are defined as people who are solely, or mostly, descended from former African slaves, or immigrants. According to the 2010 census, there are 14,517,961 Black Brazilians, about 7.6% of the population.[81]\n\n\nAlthough the majority of Brazilians have at least some degree of African heritage, the racial makeup of black Brazilians themselves is very mixed and mostly of them have a significant degree of white admixture with a minor indigenous component, the range of white admixture for Afro-Brazilians is typically between 30% and 70%; \"pure\" black Brazilians with more than 80% of their genes coming from African ancestry are a subgroup minority.[79]\n\n\n\n### Asian-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Asian Brazilians\n\nAccording to the 2006 census, people of East Asian descent number 1,919,000, or 1.1% of Brazil's population. Estimates say that there are 2.5 to 3.0 million people of Japanese descent in Brazil, who are mostly concentrated in two states: São Paulo and Paraná, but smaller communities are found in the entire territory of the country. Brazil has the largest population of Japanese descent outside Japan.[82]\n\n\nThere are also smaller communities of Korean people and Chinese origin.[83] Some Chinese, especially from Macau, speak a Portuguese-based creole language called Macanese (patuá or macaísta), aside from Hakka, Mandarin and Cantonese. Japanese immigration to Brazil started on 18 June 1908, when the Japanese ship Kasato-Maru arrived in the Port of Santos, south of São Paulo, carrying the first 781 people to take advantage of a bilateral agreement promoting immigration.\n\n\nHalf of them were from the southern part of the Okinawa Island, located about 640 km (400 miles) south of the rest of Japan, which had its own distinct language and culture dating back to before the island's annexation by Tokyo in 1879. The names on shop fronts are in Japanese and selling everything from Japanese food and kitchen utensils to traditional home decorations. Red painted archways, Japanese temples and a Japanese garden are present in this little Japanese corner of Brazil.\n\n\n\n### Aboriginal-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indigenous peoples in Brazil\n\nThe Amerindians make up 0.4% of Brazil's population, or about 700,000 people. Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although the majority of them live in Indian reservations in the North and Centre-Western part of the country. Over 60 million Brazilians possess at least one Native South American ancestor, according to a mitochondrial DNA study.[84]\n\n\nHowever, only 0.4% of the population consider themselves to be Natives. Brazilians tend to consider \"Native South American\" a cultural, not racial category. When the first Portuguese arrived in Brazil, in 1500, there were between 2.5 and 3.2 million Natives living in the country. In the mid-19th century they were only 100,000 and in the late 20th century close to 300,000.\n\n\n\n## Genetic studies[edit]\n\n\nGenetic studies have shown the Brazilian population as a whole to have European, African and Native American components.\n\n\n\n### Autosomal DNA studies[edit]\n\n\nA 2015 autosomal DNA genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).[85]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[85] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 16%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 58%\n | 27%\n | 15%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 64%\n | 24%\n | 12%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 67%\n | 23%\n | 10%\n |\n| South Region | 77%\n | 12%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal DNA study (2011), with nearly 1000 samples from every major race group (\"whites\", \"pardos\" and \"blacks\", according to their respective proportions) all over the country found out a major European contribution, followed by a high African contribution and an important Native American component.[86]\n\n\n\"In all regions studied, the European ancestry was predominant, with proportions ranging from 60.6% in the Northeast to 77.7% in the South\". The 2011 autosomal study samples came from blood donors (the lowest classes constitute the great majority of blood donors in Brazil[87]), and also public health institutions personnel and health students.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Region[86] | European\n | African\n | Native American\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Northern Brazil | 68.80%\n | 10.50%\n | 18.50%\n |\n| Northeast Brazil | 69.10%\n | 18.30%\n | 12.40%\n |\n| Southeast Brazil | 74.20%\n | 17.30%\n | 7.30%\n |\n| Southern Brazil | 79.50%\n | 10.30%\n | 9.40%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a predominant degree of European ancestry combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees. 'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban\npopulations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.[88]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[89] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 17%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 61%\n | 26%\n | 13%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 58%\n | 26%\n | 16%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 61%\n | 27%\n | 12%\n |\n| South Region | 74%\n | 15%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal DNA study from 2009 found a similar profile: \"all the Brazilian samples (regions) lie more closely to the European group than to the African populations or to the Mestizos from Mexico\".[90]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[91] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 60.6%\n | 21.3%\n | 18.1%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 68.3%\n | 21.1%\n | 10.6%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 66.3%\n | 21.7%\n | 12.0%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 60.7%\n | 32.0%\n | 7.3%\n |\n| South Region | 81.5%\n | 9.3%\n | 9.2%\n |\n\n\nA 2015 autosomal genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).[85]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[85] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 16%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 61%\n | 23%\n | 16%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 64%\n | 24%\n | 12%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 67%\n | 23%\n | 10%\n |\n| South Region | 77%\n | 12%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nPairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bioanthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations\".[92]\n\n\nAccording to another autosomal DNA study from 2008, by the University of Brasília (UnB), European ancestry dominates in the whole of Brazil (in all regions), accounting for 65.90% of heritage of the population, followed by the African contribution (24.80%) and the Native American (9.3%).[93]\n\n\nSão Paulo state, the most populous state in Brazil, with about 40 million people, showed the following composition, according to an autosomal study from 2006: European genes account for 79% of the heritage of the people of São Paulo, 14% are of African origin, and 7% Native American.[94] A study from 2013 found the following composition in São Paulo state: 61.9% European, 25.5% African and 11.6% Native American.[95] Another study focused on highly admixed populations yielded similar results.[96]\n\n\n\n## Races and ethnicities by region[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Brazil socio-geographic division\n\n### South[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Centro-Sul\n\nThe South of Brazil is the region with the largest percentage of Europeans. According to the 2005 census, people of European ancestry account for 87% of the population.[82] In colonial times, this region had a very small population.\n\n\nThe region what is now Southern Brazil was originally settled by Amerindian peoples, mostly Guarani and Kaingangs.[97] Only a few settlers from São Paulo were living there. This situation made the region vulnerable to attacks from neighboring countries. This fact forced the King of Portugal to decide to populate the region. For this, settlers from the Portuguese Azores islands were sent to the coast in 1617.[98]\n\n\nTo stimulate the immigration to Brazil, the king offered several benefits for the Azorean couples. Between 1748 and 1756, six thousand Portuguese from the Azores moved to the coast of Santa Catarina. They were mainly newly married who were seeking a better life. At that time, the Azores were one of the poorest regions of Portugal.\n\n\nThey established themselves mainly in the Santa Catarina Island, nowadays the region of Florianópolis. Later, some couples moved to Rio Grande do Sul, where they established Porto Alegre, the capital. The Azoreans lived on fishing and agriculture, especially flour. They composed over half of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina's population in the late 18th century.[99] The state of Paraná was settled by colonists from São Paulo due to their proximity (Paraná was part of São Paulo until the mid-19th century).\n\n\nWith the development of cattle in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul, African slaves began arriving in large numbers. By 1822, Africans were 50% of Rio Grande do Sul's population. This number decreased to 25% in 1858 and to only 5.2% in 2005. Most of them came from Angola.[100]\n\n\nAfter independence from Portugal (1822) the Brazilian government started to stimulate the arrival of a new wave of immigrants to settle the South. In 1824 they established São Leopoldo, a German community. Major Schaeffer, a German who was living in Brazil, was sent to Germany in order to bring immigrants. From Rhineland-Palatinate, the Major brought the immigrants and soldiers. Settlers from Germany were brought to work as small farmers, because there were many land holdings without workers.[101]\n\n\nTo attract the immigrants, the Brazilian government had promised large tracts of land, where they could settle with their families and colonize the region. The first years were not easy. Many Germans died of tropical disease, while others left the colonies to find better living conditions. The German colony of São Leopoldo was a disaster. Nevertheless, in the following years, a further 4,830 Germans arrived at São Leopoldo, and then the colony started to develop, with the immigrants establishing the town of Novo Hamburgo (*New Hamburg*).[102]\n\n\nFrom São Leopoldo and Novo Hamburgo, the German immigrants spread into others areas of Rio Grande do Sul, mainly close to sources of rivers. The whole region of Vale dos Sinos was populated by Germans. During the 1830s and part of the 1840s German immigration to Brazil was interrupted due to conflicts in the country (Ragamuffin War). The immigration restarted after 1845 with the creation of new colonies. The most important ones were Blumenau, in 1850, and Joinville in 1851, both in Santa Catarina state; these attracted thousands of German immigrants to the region.\nIn the next five decades, other 28 thousand Germans were brought to Rio Grande do Sul to work as small farmers in the countryside.[103] By 1914, it is estimated that 50 thousand Germans settled in this state.\n\n\nAnother immigration boom to this region started in 1875. Communities with Italian immigrants were also created in southern Brazil. The first colonies to be populated by Italians were created in the highlands of Rio Grande do Sul (Serra Gaúcha). These were Garibaldi and Bento Gonçalves. These immigrants were predominantly from Veneto, in northern Italy. After five years, in 1880, the great numbers of Italian immigrants arriving caused the Brazilian government to create another Italian colony, Caxias do Sul. After initially settling in the government-promoted colonies, many of the Italian immigrants spread themselves into other areas of Rio Grande do Sul seeking further opportunities.[104]\n\n\nThey created many other Italian colonies on their own, mainly in highlands, because the lowlands were already populated by Germans and native *gaúchos*. The Italian established many vineyards in the region. Nowadays, the wine produced in these areas of Italian colonization in southern Brazil is much appreciated within the country, though little is available for export. In 1875, the first Italian colonies were established in Santa Catarina, which lies immediately to the north of Rio Grande do Sul. The colonies gave rise to towns such as Criciúma, and later also spread further north, to Paraná.\n\n\nA significant number of Poles have settled in Southern Brazil. The first immigrants arrived in 1869 and until 1959, it is estimated that over 100,000 Poles migrated to Brazil,[105] 95% of whom were peasants. The State of Paraná received the majority of Polish immigrants, who settled mainly in the region of Curitiba, in the towns of Mallet, Cruz Machado, São Matheus do Sul, Irati, and União da Vitória.[106]\n\n\n\n### Southeast[edit]\n\n\nThe Southeastern region of Brazil is the most ethnically diverse part of the country. Europeans make up 55.16% of its population, those of mixed-race 35.69%, and African descent 7.91%. It has the largest percentage of Asian Brazilians, composing 0.8%, and a small Amerindian community (0.2%).\n\n\nSoutheast Brazil is home to the oldest Portuguese village in the Americas, São Vicente, São Paulo, established in 1532.[107] The region, since the beginning of its colonization, is a melting pot of Africans, Natives, and Europeans. The Indigenous peoples of the region were enslaved by the Portuguese.\n\n\nThe race mixing between the indigenous females and their European masters produced the Bandeirante, the colonial inhabitant of São Paulo, who formed expeditions that crossed the interior of Brazil and greatly increased the Portuguese colonial territory. The main language spoken by these people of mixed Indian/Portuguese heritage was Língua geral, a language that mixed Tupi and Portuguese words.\n\n\nIn the late 17th century the Bandeirantes found gold in the area that nowadays is Minas Gerais. A gold rush took place in Brazil and thousands of Portuguese colonists arrived during this period. The confrontation between the Bandeirantes and the Portuguese for obtaining possession of the mines led to the Emboabas' War.\n\n\nThe Portuguese won the war. The Amerindian culture declined, giving space to a stronger Portuguese cultural domination. In order to control the wealth, the Portuguese Crown moved the capital of Brazil from Salvador, Bahia to Rio de Janeiro. Thousands of African slaves were brought to work in the gold mines.\n\n\nThey were landed in Rio de Janeiro and sent to other regions. By the late 18th century, Rio de Janeiro was an \"African city\": most of its inhabitants were slaves. No other place in the world had as many slaves since the end of the Roman Empire.[108] In 1808 the Portuguese royal family, fleeing from Napoleon, took charge in Rio de Janeiro. Some 15,000 Portuguese nobles moved to Brazil. The region changed a lot, becoming more European.\n\n\nAfter independence and principally after 1850, Southeast Brazil was \"inundated\" by European immigrants, who were attracted by the government to replace the African slaves in the coffee plantations. Most immigrants landed in the Port of Santos and have been forwarded to the coffee farms within São Paulo.\n\n\nThe vast majority of the immigrants came from Italy. Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953. The large number of Italians are visible in many parts of Southeast Brazil. Their descendants are nowadays predominant in many areas. For example, Northeast São Paulo is 45% Italian.[109]\n\n\nThe arrival of immigrants from several parts of Europe, the Middle-East and Asia produced an ethnically diverse population. The city of Bastos, in São Paulo, is 11.4% Japanese. The city of São Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan itself.\n[110]\n\n\n\n### Northeast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Nordeste (socio-geographic division)\n\nThe population of Northeast Brazil is a result of an intensive race mixing, which has occurred in the region for more than four centuries. According to the 2006 census people reported as \"Pardo\" (Multiracial) make up 60.5% of the population. Those reported as African account for 5.9%.\n\n\nThis region did not have much effect from the massive European immigration that took place in Southern Brazil in the late 19th century and first decades of the 20th century. The Northeast has been a poorer region of Brazil since the decline of sugar cane plantations in the late 17th century, so its economy did not require immigrants.\n\n\nThe ethnic composition of the population starts in the 16th century. The Portuguese settlers rarely brought women, which led to relationships with the Indian women. Later, interracial relationships occurred between Portuguese males and African females. The coast, in the past the place where millions of African slaves arrived (mostly from modern-day Angola, Ghana, Nigeria and Benin) to work in sugar-cane plantations, is where nowadays there is a predominance of Mulattoes, those of African and European ancestry. Salvador, Bahia is considered the largest African city outside of Africa, with over 80% of its inhabitants being African-Brazilians. In the interior, there is a predominance of Indian and European mixture.[111]\n\n\n\n### North[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Amazônia Legal\n\nNorthern Brazil, largely covered by the Amazon rainforest, is the Brazilian region with the largest Amerindian influences, both in culture and ethnicity. Inhabited by diverse indigenous tribes, this part of Brazil was reached by Portuguese and Spanish colonists in the 17th century, but it started to be populated by non-Indians only in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The exploitation of rubber used in the growing industries of automobiles, has emerged a huge migration to the region.\n\n\nMany people from the poor Northeast Brazil, mostly Ceará, moved to the Amazon area. The contact between the Indians and the northeastern rubbers created the base of the ethnic composition of the region, with its mixed-race majority.\n\n\n\n### Central-West[edit]\n\n\nThe Central-West region of Brazil was inhabited by diverse Indians when the Portuguese arrived in the early 18th century. The Portuguese came to explore the precious stones that were found there. Contact between the Portuguese and the Indians created a mixed-race population. Until the mid-20th century, Central-West Brazil had a very small population. The situation changed with the construction of Brasília, the new capital of Brazil, in 1960. Many workers were attracted to the region, mostly from northeastern Brazil.\n\n\nA new wave of settlers started arriving from the 1970s. With the mechanization of agriculture in the South of Brazil, many rural workers of German and Italian origin migrated to Central-West Brazil. In some areas, they are already the majority of the population.\n\n\n\n## Education and health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Brazil and Health care in Brazil\n\nThe Federal Constitution of 1988 and the 1996 *General Law of Education in Brazil* (LDB) attributed to the Federal Government, states, Federal District and municipalities the responsibility of managing the Brazilian educational system, considering three educational public systems as a basis for collaboration between these federal systems.\n\n\nEach of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as mechanisms and sources for financial resources. The new Constitution reserves 25% of state and municipal taxes and 18% of federal taxes for education.[112]\n\n\nAs set out by the Brazilian Constitution, the main responsibility for basic education is attributed to the states and municipalities. Hence, a historical feature of Brazilian basic education is its extremely decentralized nature, which gives great organizational autonomy to sub-national governments (27 states and 5,546 municipalities) in organizing their educational systems.\n\n\nEarly childhood education, from 0–6 years, is under exclusive responsibility of the municipalities. Responsibility for compulsory primary education from 1st to 9th grades is shared between states and municipalities. Kindergarten and pre-school education are the responsibility of local levels of government, whereas secondary schools are under the responsibility of the states.\n\n\nMaintenance of the system, including salaries, the definition of teacher career structures and supervision of early childhood, primary, and secondary levels (which make up basic education) is decentralized, and these levels are responsible for defining their respective curriculum content.\n\n\nHigher education starts with undergraduate or sequential courses, which may offer different specialization choices such as academic or vocational paths. Depending on the choice, students may improve their educational background with *Stricto Sensu* or *Lato Sensu* postgraduate courses.\n\n\nHigher education has three main purposes: teaching, research and extension, each with their own specific contribution to make to a particular course. Diplomas and certificates are proof of having passed through higher education.\n\n\nAccording to Brazilian Government, the most serious health problems are:[113]\n\n\n\n* Childhood mortality: about 2.51% of childhood mortality, reaching 3.77% in the northeast region.\n* Motherhood mortality: about 73.1 deaths per 100,000 born children in 2002.\n* Mortality by non-transmissible illness: 151.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by heart and circulatory diseases, along with 72.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by cancer.\n* Mortality caused by external causes (transportation, violence and suicide): 71.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants (14.9% of all deaths in the country), reaching 82.3 deaths in the southeast region.\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Brazil\n\nAccording to the IBGE census 2010[114] 64.6% are Roman Catholics; 24% are Protestants and other Christians, 8% are agnostics, atheists or have no religion, 2% are followers of Spiritism, and 1% are members of other religions. Some of these religions are Jehovah's Witnesses (1,100,000), Latter-day Saints (200,000), Buddhism (215,000), Judaism (86,000), and Islam (27,000).[115]\n\n\nBrazil has the largest Roman Catholic population in the world.[116]\n\n\nFollowers of Protestantism are rising in number. Until 1970, the majority of Brazilian Protestants were adherents of \"traditional churches\", mostly Lutherans, Presbyterians and Baptists. There are 120,000 Episcopalians in 9 dioceses (Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil). Since then, numbers of Pentecostal and Neopentecostal adherents have increased significantly.\n\n\nIslam in Brazil was first practiced by African slaves.[117] The Muslim population in Brazil is made up mostly of Arab immigrants.[118]\n\n\nThe largest population of Buddhists in Latin America lives in Brazil, due greatly to Brazil's large Japanese population.\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Languages of Brazil and Portuguese language\n\nPortuguese is the only official language of Brazil.[119] It is spoken by nearly the entire population and is virtually the only language used in schools, newspapers, radio, TV and for all business and administrative purposes. Moreover, Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity.\n\n\nMany Amerindian languages are spoken daily in indigenous communities, primarily in Northern Brazil. Although many of these communities have significant contact with Portuguese,[120] there are incentives stimulating preservation and the teaching of native languages. According to SIL International, 133 Native American languages are currently endangered. Some of the largest indigenous language groups include Arawak, Carib, Macro-Gê and Tupi.[121] In 2006, the City of São Gabriel da Cachoeira in the region of Cabeça do Cachorro (Northwestern region of the State of Amazonas), has adopted some indigenous languages as some of its other official languages along with Portuguese.\n\n\nOther languages are spoken by descendants of immigrants, who are usually bilingual, in small rural communities in Southern Brazil. The most important are the Brazilian German dialects, such as Riograndenser Hunsrückisch and the East Pomeranian dialect, and also the Talian, based on the Italian Venetian language. There are also bilingual speakers of Polish, Ukrainian and Russian in Southern Brazil, especially Paraná. In the city of São Paulo, Levantine, Japanese, Chinese and Korean can be heard in the immigrant neighborhoods, such as Liberdade. Yiddish and Hebrew are used by Jewish communities mainly in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, Brasília, Belo Horizonte and Recife as well as the Vlax Romani dialect by Romani communities all across the nation.\n\n\n\n## *The World Factbook* demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from *The World Factbook*, unless otherwise indicated[122]\n\n\n\n### Nationality[edit]\n\n\n* noun: Brazilian(s)\n* adjective: Brazilian\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n* 217,650,530\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\n* Portuguese (official)\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\n* European | mainly Portuguese 47.6%\n* Caboclo, Castizo 23.1%\n* Mulatto, Quadroon, Octoroon 21%\n* Black Brazilians 7.0%\n* Asian (mainly Japanese) 1.2%\n* Indigenous 0.4%\n* Romani 0.4%\n* Eurasian, Hafu 0.3%\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\n* Total population: 94.4%\n* Male: 92.4%\n* Female: 96.4% (2019 est.)\n\n\n### Religions[edit]\n\n\n* Roman Catholic 64.6%\n* Other Catholic 0.4%\n* Protestant 22.2%\n\t+ Adventist (including Seventh-day Adventist and Adventist Church of Promise) 6.5%\n\t+ Assembly of God 2.0%\n\t+ Christian Congregation of Brazil 1.2%\n\t+ Universal Church of the Kingdom of God 1.0%\n\t+ Other Protestant 11.5%\n\t+ Other Christian 0.7%\n* Spiritist 2.2%\n* Other 1.4%\n* None 8%\n* Unspecified 0.4%\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Brazil\n* 2022 Brazilian census\n* Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n* Demographics of Rio de Janeiro\n* List of largest cities in Brazil\n* Racial democracy\n* *Brazilian Journal of Population Studies*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** População do Brasil – IBGE\n2. **^** \"Censo Demográfi co 20200 Características da população e dos domicílios Resultados do universo\" (PDF). 8 November 2021.

The first official census took place in 1872. From that year, every 8 years (with some exceptions) the population is counted.

The highest rate was in Acre, with 1.98 children per woman. Other regions with high fertility include Amapá, with 1.87 children per woman, Amazonas, 1.85 in Roraima, 1.84, in Maranhão, 1.82, and Pará, 1.79.\n\n\nOn the other hand, São Paulo is the state with the lowest rate, 1.26 children per woman. Other states with low fertility include Santa Catarina, with 1.28, Rio Grande do Sul, 1.3, in Rio de Janeiro, 1.32 in Paraná and Minas Gerais, 1.33.\n\n\nRegarding race of mothers, between 2015 and 2021, the fertility rate of all racial groups fell below replacement rate. Black fertility fell from 2.01 to 1.76, Pardo/Mixed fertility fell from 1.95 to 1.73 and white fertility fell from 1.90 to 1.55. There was no information regarding Asian fertility rates. Indigenous fertility was calculated at 1.87 children per women in 2010.[22]\n\n\n\n### Childlessness and education[edit]\n\n\nThe color or race of the woman and the level of education has also shown to influence the fact of not having children. In 2013, among white women aged 15 to 55 years, 41.5% had no children, while among black and brown women, the percentage was 35.8%.\n\n\nThe proportional difference is even greater among white women compared to black and brown 25–29 years. While the proportion among white women childless was 48.1% among black and brown women was 33.8%.\n\n\nRegarding education, among women 15–49 years of age with more than eight years of schooling, 44.2% had no children in 2013, while among those with up to seven years of study this figure was 21.6%.\n\n\nSchooling among women 25–29 years has shown an even greater disparity. Among the less educated, 16.3% had no children, while among the more educated 54.5% had no children.

Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of largest cities in Brazil and Largest Cities of Northeast Region, Brazil\nIn Brazil, most important cities are on the coast or close to it. State capitals are also, commonly, the largest city of their states. Notable exceptions to this are Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina.\n\n\nThere are also non-capital metropolitan areas, for example, in São Paulo state (Campinas, Santos, Paraíba Valley, Sorocaba, Ribeirão Preto and Franca), Minas Gerais (Steel Valley), Rio Grande do Sul (Sinos Valley), and Santa Catarina (Itajaí Valley), amongst others.\n\n\nSão Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are far larger than any other Brazilian cities. São Paulo's influence in most economic aspects can be noted in a national (and even international) scale; Rio de Janeiro – partially due to its former status as the national capital – still host various large corporations' headquarters, besides being Brazil's cultural center with respect to film production and other such televised media. Brasília, the capital of Brazil, is its 3rd biggest city.\n\n\n\n## Migration[edit]\n\n\n### Summary[edit]\n\n\nThe United Nations reported in the International Migration Stock that 64 countries had significant emigration or immigration with Brazil in 2020.[26][27] The Migration Policy Institute defines significant migration if 1,000+ people are in the emigration or/and migration group.[28] Venezuela, Haiti, Portugal, Bolivia, and Uruguay have the most positive net migration, while the United States, Japan, Spain, Italy, and France have the most negative net migration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|

etc. Brazil has received the third largest number of immigrants in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\nBrazil's structure, legislation and settlement policies for arriving immigrants were much less organized than in Canada and the United States at the time. Nevertheless, an Immigrant Inn (*Hospedaria dos Imigrantes*) was built in 1886 in São Paulo, and quick admittance and recording routines for the throngs of immigrants arriving by ship at the seaports of Vitória, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Paranaguá, Florianópolis and Porto Alegre were established. The São Paulo State alone processed more than 2.5 million immigrants in its almost 100 years of continuous operation. People of more than 70 different nationalities were recorded.\n\n\nFollowing the trend of several other countries in the Americas, which encouraged immigration from many countries, Brazil quickly became a melting pot of races and nationalities, but being peculiar in the sense of having the highest degree of intermarriage in the world. Immigrants found a strong social and cultural tolerance toward inter-racial marriage, including large numbers of Mulattoes (European and African), Caboclos (Indian and European) and mixed European, African and Indian people, though it was not accompanied by an entire lack of racism. Correspondingly, the same mentality reflected in low psychological and social barriers regarding intermarriage between Europeans, Middle Easterners and Asians of several origins, as well as between people of different religions.\n\n\n\n### History of immigration[edit]\n\n\nIt is postulated that the Americas were settled by three migratory waves from Northern Asia. The Native Brazilians are thought to descend from the first wave of migrants, who arrived in the region around 9000 BC. The main Native Brazilian groups are the Tupi-Guarani, the Jê, the Arawaks and the Caraibas (Kalina or Caribs). The Tupi-Guarani nation, originally from the Paraná river basin and also one of the largest of the Native-Paraguayan nations, had spread all along the Brazilian coastline from South to North and came to be known by the Portuguese as \"Os Índios da Língua Geral\" (\"The Indians of the General Language\"); the Jê nation occupied most of the interior of the country from Maranhão to Santa Catarina. The Arawaks and the Caribs, the last ones to get in contact with the Portuguese, lived in the North and Northwest of Brazil.\n\n\nThe European immigration to Brazil started in the 16th century, with the vast majority of them coming from Portugal. In the first two centuries of colonization, 100,000 Portuguese arrived in Brazil (around 500 colonists per year). In the 18th century, 600,000 Portuguese arrived (6,000 per year).[29] The first region to be settled by the Portuguese was Northeastern Brazil, followed by the Southeast region. The original Amerindian population of Brazil (between two and five million) largely died from disease or violence or was assimilated into the Portuguese population.[30] The Mamelucos (or Caboclos, a mixed race between Europeans and Amerindians) have always been present in many parts of Brazil.\n\n\nAnother important ethnic group, Africans, first arrived as slaves. Many came from Guinea-Bissau, or from West African countries – by the end of the eighteenth century many had been taken from the Kingdom of Kongo and modern-day Angola, Congo, Mozambique, Benin and Nigeria. By the time of the end of the slave trade in 1850, around six million slaves had been brought to Brazil–50% of all slave traffic between Africa and the Americas. Nowadays, there are still small immigration waves coming from the African continent.\nThe largest influx of European immigrants to Brazil occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to the *Memorial do Imigrante* statistics data, Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953.[31][32]\n\n\nThese immigrants were divided in two groups: a part of them was sent to Southern Brazil to work as small farmers. However, the biggest part of the immigrants was sent to Southeast Brazil to work in the coffee plantations. The immigrants sent to Southern Brazil were mainly Germans (starting in 1824, mainly from Rhineland-Palatinate, Pomerania, Hamburg, Westphalia, etc.) Italians (starting in 1875, mainly from the Veneto and Lombardia), Austrians, Poles, Ukrainians, Dutch and Russians. In the South, the immigrants established rural communities that retain a cultural connection with their ancestral homelands. In Southeast Brazil, most of the immigrants were Italians (mainly from the Veneto, Campania, Calabria and Lombardia), Portuguese (mainly from Beira Alta, Minho and Alto Trás-os-Montes), Dutch, Spaniards (mainly from Galicia and Andalusia), Lithuanians, French, Hungarians and Ashkenazi Jews.\n\n\nNotably, the first half of the 20th century saw a large inflow of Japanese (mainly from Honshū, Hokkaidō and Okinawa) and Levantine Christians from Lebanon (and few from Syria). These Christian Levantine immigrants were wrongly called \"Turks\" by many Brazilians because their original countries were still under Ottoman rule back in the period when their immigration to Brazil began. The number of actual Turks who immigrated to Brazil was in fact very small. Chinese, Taiwanese and Koreans influx became common after the 1950s.\n\n\n\n### IBGE's 1998 PME[edit]\n\n\nOn the other hand, in 1998, the IBGE, within its preparation for the 2000 census, experimentally introduced a question about \"origem\" (origin/ancestry) in its \"Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego\" (Monthly Employment Research), to test the viability of introducing that variable in the census[33]: 3 (the IBGE ended by deciding against the inclusion of questions about it in the census). This research interviewed about 90,000 people in six metropolitan regions (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, and Recife).[34] To this day, it remains the only actual published survey about the immigrant origin of Brazilians.\n\n\nHere are its results:[35]\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazilian Population, by ancestry, 1998[33]\n| Ancestry | %\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Brazil](image) \"Brazilian\" | 86.09%\n |\n| ![Portugal](image) Portuguese | 10.46%\n |\n| ![Italy](image) Italian | 10.41%\n |\n| Indigenous | 6.64%\n |\n| Black | 5.09%\n |\n| ![Spain](image) Spanish | 4.40%\n |\n| ![Germany](image) German | 3.54%\n |\n| African | 2.06%\n |\n| ![Japan](image) Japanese | 1.34%\n |\n| ![Lebanon](image)![Syria](image) Lebanese/Syrian | 0.48%\n |\n| Jewish | 0.20%\n |\n| Others | 2.81%\n |\n| Total | 133.52%\n |\n\n\nNotice that the total is higher than 100% because of multiple answers. Many Brazilians are unaware of their ancestry, especially those of old immigration, due to this the high number who declared themselves only as Brazilians.\n\n\n\n### Emigration[edit]\n\n\nIn the second half of the 1980s, Brazilians from various socioeconomic backgrounds started to emigrate to other countries in search of better economic opportunities.\n\n\nBy the 1990s, nearly 1.9 million Brazilians were living outside the country, mainly in the United States, Paraguay and Japan,[36] but also in Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Israel. Despite the surge in the phenomenon, there were no specific policies implemented by the government to encourage or discourage this emigration process.[37] Thanks to the favourable outlook of the Brazilian economy and due to the crisis that hit countries such as Japan, Portugal or the United States, emigration of Brazilian citizens stagnated - with many returning to their home country - until 2011, when 1,898,762 Brazilians were living abroad.\n\n\nThe 2000 Brazilian census provides some information about the high number of migrants returning to Brazil. For instance, of those who reported residing in another country less than 10 years before the 2000 census, 66.9 percent were Brazilians. If only the returning migrants (former Brazilian immigrants) are considered, 26.8 percent of Brazilians came from Paraguay, 17 percent came from Japan, and 15.8 percent came from the United States.[37]\n\n\nAs political unrest, increasing violence, inflation, soaring unemployment rates and an economic crisis hit Brazil, millions of citizens moved abroad starting in 2011, generating the largest emigration process ever witnessed in Brazilian history, since Brazil has historically been a land of immigrants. In 2021 more than 4.4 million Brazilians live abroad,[38] this is an increase of around 132% compared to the previous 10 years.\n\n\nThe largest Brazilian community abroad - comprising almost half of the diaspora - is the one in the US, where around 2,000,000 Brazilians live; they are present especially in Florida. Almost 300,000 Brazilians - hence 6.8% of all Brazilians living abroad - lived in other Portuguese-speaking countries (94% in Portugal). In the same year around 680,000 Brazilians - hence 15.5% of the Brazilian diaspora - lived in Spanish-speaking countries, with the majority found in neighbouring countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\n\nOther major communities are found in countries such as the UK (220,000 Brazilians in 2021), Canada (122,500 Brazilians in 2021) Ireland (70,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Australia (60,000 Brazilians in 2021).\n\n\nThere are also noticeable Brazilian communities in countries once source of immigrants such as Japan (210,000 Brazilians in 2021), Italy (162,000 Brazilians in 2021), Germany (140,000 Brazilians in 2021), the Netherlands (65,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Lebanon (21,000 Brazilians in 2021). Many of the Brazilians found in these countries are descendants of the early immigrants who came to Brazil in the early 1900s.\n\n\nThere is also a sizeable Brazilian community in France (172,000 Brazilians in 2021), almost equally split between Metropolitan France and French Guyana.\n\n\n\n## Racial composition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n\n![](image)Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has Italian ancestry\n![](image)Italian regional immigration to Brazil, which has the most people of Italian origin outside Italy. Unlike other countries with Italian immigrants, Brazil prioritized Northern Italy which it considered more developed\n![](image)German colonies in Southern BrazilThe bulk of the Brazilian population descends from three main source populations (either alone, or more commonly, in varying combinations mixed in varying degrees); early European settlers (chiefly ethnic Portuguese, but also Portuguese New Christians of ethnic Sephardic Jewish origin forced to convert to Christianity),[39] sub-Saharan Africans (Yoruba, Ewe, Akan, Bantu, and others), and the indigenous peoples in Brazil (mostly Tupi and Guarani, but also many other indigenous Brazilian ethnic groups).\n\n\nStarting in the late 19th century, Brazil received substantial post-colonial immigration from several other regions, mainly from peoples of what are now the countries of Italy, Germany, Spain, Poland, as well as Middle-Eastern Christians from the Levant (mostly from what is now Lebanon, and less so from Syria), Ukraine, Japan, China and Korea.\n\n\nJews in Brazil are a small but sizable population,[40][41] and they include mostly Ashkenazi Jews (who also arrived with the post-colonial contingent of European migration),[42] a smaller proportion of Sephardi Jews (mostly Eastern Sephardim arrived with the contingent of post-colonial immigrants from Syria and Lebanon, but also North African Sephardim from Morocco settled in the Amazon, and Western Sephardim arrived with the Dutch), and to a much lesser extent Mizrahi Jews.\n\n\nOverall, the small but sizable Brazilian Jewish community is concentrated especially in São Paulo,[43] Rio de Janeiro[44] and Porto Alegre,[45] and they are accounted for without Brazilian descendants of Portuguese \"New Christians\" (ethnic Sephardic Jews forced to convert to Christianity and arrived with the ethnic Portuguese during the colonial period),[42] which if included would inflate the Jewish origin population in Brazil considerably. By themselves, Brazilian descendants of Portuguese \"New Christians\" are estimated to account for a figure anywhere between hundreds of thousands to several million.\n\n\nThe descendants of European immigrants, particularly the Germans, Italians, Austrians, Swiss, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Dutch, Lithuanians, Scandinavians, Russians, Hungarians, Finns and Luxembourgers are mainly concentrated in the southern part of the country, in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, and the most populous, São Paulo; these states have a wide majority of citizens of European descent.[46][47]\nSão Paulo alone has the largest population in absolute numbers with 30 million Europeans.[48]\n\n\nIn the rest of the country, part of the European-Brazilian population is of colonial Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish and French settler stock, especially in the Northeast. In the mid-southern states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul and in the Federal District, the number of Europeans (European and Levantine phenotype) revolves around 50% of the population or above, being close to the proportion of people of Mixed-race Brazilians, and other minorities like Black Brazilians and East Asian Brazilians.[49]\n\n\nIn the Northeast, which received large masses of African slaves to work in sugarcane, tobacco and cotton plantations, people of African and mixed-race descent predominate, mostly on the coast, whereas in the semi-arid country land (usually called *sertão*) there is a predominance of Europeans and Amerindian-European mixed people. Most of the African or mulatto people in the *sertão* are descended from freed African slaves or mulattos who fled inland from the coast and worked as cowboys for semi-feudal lords.\n\n\nThe city of Salvador da Bahia is considered one of the largest African cities of the world. In the Northwest (covering largely the Brazilian Amazon), a great part of the population has distinguishable ethnic characteristics that emphasize their Amerindian roots. Other ethnic groups have merged with the Indigenous tribes there. This region is not densely populated, and \"caboclos\", people of mixed native and European descent, are a small part of the entire Brazilian population.\n\n\nThe Japanese are the largest Asian group in Brazil. In fact, Brazil has the largest population of Japanese ancestry outside Japan, with 1.8 million Japanese Brazilians, most of them living in São Paulo. Some Chinese and Korean also settled Brazil. Most Chinese came from mainland China, but others came from Taiwan and Hong Kong, and also from Portuguese-speaking Macau—these Chinese from Macau could speak and understand Portuguese, and it was not hard for them to adjust to Brazilian life.\n\n\nThose immigrant populations and their descendants still retain some of their original ethnic identity; however, they are not closed communities and are rapidly integrating into mainstream Brazilian society: for instance, very few of the third generation can understand their grandparents' languages.\n\n\n\n### European-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: European Brazilians\n\nAccording to the 2020 census, there were more than 104 million European-Brazilians, comprising 48% of Brazil's population.[50] European-Brazilians are defined as people who are solely or mostly descended from European immigrants, although most Brazilians have some degree of European ancestry. Europeans are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although they are most concentrated in the south and southeastern parts of the country. \n[51][52]\n\n\nA survey conducted in 1998 by the Minas Gerais sociologist Simon Schwartzman interviewed about 34 million Brazilians, of whom nearly 20 million declared themselves white. Asked the ethnic origin of the participants of white race, a plurality pointed only Brazilian origin (53%).\n\n\nMore than half, however, managed to point to a foreign origin: 17.2% indicated Portuguese ancestry, 16.50% Italian, 9.42% Spanish, 6.51% German and 12.32% other origins, which include Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Lithuanian, Dutch, Austrian, Swiss, French, Hungarian, Norwegian, partial distant African, indigenous, British, American Confederate, Jewish (mostly Ashkenazi, but also Sephardi including Jews from Morocco and Egypt) and Christian Levantine (Lebanese).[53][54]\n\n\nNearly one million Europeans had arrived in Brazil by 1800; most of them colonists from Portugal. An immigration boom occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries, when nearly six million Europeans emigrated to Brazil, most of them Portuguese, Germans, Italians and Spaniards.\n\n\nMany European-Brazilians have some Amerindian and/or African ancestry (similarly found in European-Americans[55] and European-Argentines).[56] It is estimated that 75% of all Brazilians have varying degrees of Portuguese ancestry.\n\n\nNowadays, European-Brazilians come from a very diverse background, which includes:\n\n\n\n* The Dutch were among the Europeans settling in Brazil during the 17th century. From 1630 to 1654, the Dutch controlled the northeast coast of Brazil, establishing their colonial capital in Recife. During the 19th and 20th century, immigrants from the Netherlands populated the central and southern states of Brazil.[57][58] The first Dutch immigrants to South America after its independence waves from their metropoles went to the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo between 1858 and 1862, where they founded the settlement of Holanda, a colony of 500 mainly Reformed folk from West Zeelandic Flanders in the Dutch province of Zeeland.[59] Dutch and other Low Franconian languages are still spoken in São Paulo (state), especially Holambra (named after Holland-America-Brazil), famous for its tulips and the annual Expoflora event, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and around Ponta Grossa, Castrolanda and Carambeí known as little Holland, in the plains of Paraná, headquarters of several food companies and a dairy farming region.[60][61]\n* The first Germans and Austrians arrived in Brazil in 1824. Most of them established themselves in rural communities across Southern Brazil, such as São Leopoldo, Novo Hamburgo, Blumenau and Pomerode. In Santa Catarina state, Southern Brazil, Germans and Austrians represented over 45% of all immigrants arriving, and in the entire country, citizens who descend from German-speaking nationalities, including Swiss and Luxemburger, but also Volga German, may represent as much as 8% of the absolute population, since Brazil is home to the second largest German-Austrian population outside their respective nations, after the USA. And German is the second most spoken mother tongue in the country.[62][63][64] According to Ethnologue, Standard German is spoken by 1.5 million people and Brazilian German encompass assorted dialects, including Riograndenser Hunsrückisch spoken by over 3 million Brazilians.[60][65][66]\n* Italians started arriving in Brazil in 1875, making up the main group of immigrants in the late 19th century.[67] First they settled in rural communities across Southern Brazil. In the early 20th century, they mostly settled in the coffee plantations in the Southeast, later moving to São Paulo capital to work in factories or starting their own businesses in trade, services and industry like businessman and industrialist count Francesco Matarazzo. In São Paulo, which came to be labeled an \"Italian city\" in the early twentieth century, Italians engaged mainly in the incipient industry and urban services activities. They came to represent 60% of the 60,000 workers employed in São Paulo factories in 1901.[68] 11% of Brazilians or 20 million citizens are of Italian extraction, possibly the largest number outside of Italy itself, most of them descended from Northern Italians, reason why Talian, or the Venetian dialect, is the third most spoken mother tongue in the nation.[69][70]\n* Poles came in significant numbers to Brazil after 1870. Most of them settled in the State of Paraná, working as small farmers.\n* Portuguese Most Brazilians are fully or partly of Portuguese ancestry. Portuguese settlers began arriving in 1500. Immigration increased during the 18th century and reached its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Lusitanian immigration never ceased throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Portuguese people in diaspora settled in Brazil especially during the 1970s coming from former Portuguese colonies like Macau or Angola after its independence. The Portuguese were always the largest ethnic group of immigrants to Brazil. In the early years of Portuguese colonization it is estimated that between 1500 and 1800 some 600,000 Portuguese immigrated to Brazil, and then between 1800 and 1980 another 600,000, then from 1980 to the present, 600,000 more. Portuguese immigration to Brazil will always be a constant, hence, will always comprise the largest percentage of European immigrants. By 2030, there will be an estimated 1,000,000 Portuguese total immigrants in Brazil as of 1980, significantly dwarfing all of the other immigrant groups. An additional figure of 1.2 million Portuguese arrived between 1951 and 1975 to settle mostly in the Southeast.[71] Nowadays, Lusitanians (Portuguese) constitute the biggest group of foreigners living in the country, with over 700,000 Portuguese nationals currently living in Brazil.[72] The vast majority arrived in the last decade. The first semester of 2011 solely had an increase of 52 thousand Portuguese nationals applying for a permanent residence visa while another large group was granted Brazilian citizenship.[73][74]\n* Spaniards came in large numbers to Brazil, starting in the late 19th century. Most of them were attracted to work in the coffee plantations in the state of São Paulo. An estimated 15 million Brazilians are of direct Spanish descent.[75]\n* Ukrainians came mostly in the late 19th century. Currently they number approximately 980,000, most of whom live in a compact settlement in south central Paraná.[76]\n\n\nSee also: Dutch Brazilian, German Brazilian, Italian Brazilian, Polish Brazilian, Portuguese Brazilian, Spanish Brazilian, and Ukrainian Brazilian\n\n### Mixed-race/Pardo-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pardo Brazilians\n\nThe Pardos can be a mixture of Europeans, Levantine, Crypto-Jews or Anusim, Africans, Amerindians, Roma and Asians. Brazil does not have a category for multiracial people, but a Pardo (brown) one, which may include caboclos, mulatos, cafuzos (local ethnonyms for people of noticeable mixed European and Amerindian, African and European, and Amerindian and African descent, i.e., mestizos, mulattoes and zambos, respectively), the multiracial result of their intermixing (despite most of European and African Brazilians possessing some degree of race-mixing, since brownness in Brazil is a matter of phenotype) and assimilated, westernized indigenous people.[77][78]\n\n\nThe Pardos make up 43.13% or 82.3 million people of Brazil's population. Multiracial Brazilians live in the entire territory of Brazil. Although, according to DNA resources, most Brazilians possess some degree of mixed-race ancestry, less than 45% of the country's population classified themselves as being part of this group due to phenotype.[79]\n\n\nThe caboclo or mestiço population, those whose ancestry is Native and European, revolves around 43 million people or 21% of the population. Genetic studies conducted by the geneticist Sergio D.J. Pena of the Federal University of Minas Gerais have shown that the caboclo population is made of individuals whose DNA ranges from 70% to 90% European (mostly Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, French or Italian 1500s to 1700s male settlers) with the remaining percentage spanning different Indigenous markers.\n\n\nSimilar DNA tests showed that people self-classified as mulatto or European and African mix, span from 62% to 83% European (mostly descendants of Portuguese, Dutch and French settlers during the colonial period in the Northeast). The pardo category in Brazil also includes 800 thousand Roma people, most of them coming from Portugal but also different countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. Eurasians can also be classified as pardo. The majority of them consisting of Ainoko or Hafu, individuals of Japanese and European ancestry.\n\n\nResearch has suggested that Asians from the early Portuguese Eastern Empire, known as Luso-Asians first came to Brazil during the sixteenth century as seamen known as Lascars, or as servants, slaves and concubines accompanying the governors, merchants and clergy who has served in Portuguese Asia.[80] This first presence of Asians was limited to Northeast Brazil, especially Bahia, but others were brought as cultivators, textile workers and miners to Pará and other parts of the Northeast.\n\n\n\n### African-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Afro-Brazilians\n\nAfrican-Brazilians are defined as people who are solely, or mostly, descended from former African slaves, or immigrants. According to the 2010 census, there are 14,517,961 Black Brazilians, about 7.6% of the population.[81]\n\n\nAlthough the majority of Brazilians have at least some degree of African heritage, the racial makeup of black Brazilians themselves is very mixed and mostly of them have a significant degree of white admixture with a minor indigenous component, the range of white admixture for Afro-Brazilians is typically between 30% and 70%; \"pure\" black Brazilians with more than 80% of their genes coming from African ancestry are a subgroup minority.[79]\n\n\n\n### Asian-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Asian Brazilians\n\nAccording to the 2006 census, people of East Asian descent number 1,919,000, or 1.1% of Brazil's population. Estimates say that there are 2.5 to 3.0 million people of Japanese descent in Brazil, who are mostly concentrated in two states: São Paulo and Paraná, but smaller communities are found in the entire territory of the country. Brazil has the largest population of Japanese descent outside Japan.[82]\n\n\nThere are also smaller communities of Korean people and Chinese origin.[83] Some Chinese, especially from Macau, speak a Portuguese-based creole language called Macanese (patuá or macaísta), aside from Hakka, Mandarin and Cantonese. Japanese immigration to Brazil started on 18 June 1908, when the Japanese ship Kasato-Maru arrived in the Port of Santos, south of São Paulo, carrying the first 781 people to take advantage of a bilateral agreement promoting immigration.\n\n\nHalf of them were from the southern part of the Okinawa Island, located about 640 km (400 miles) south of the rest of Japan, which had its own distinct language and culture dating back to before the island's annexation by Tokyo in 1879. The names on shop fronts are in Japanese and selling everything from Japanese food and kitchen utensils to traditional home decorations. Red painted archways, Japanese temples and a Japanese garden are present in this little Japanese corner of Brazil.\n\n\n\n### Aboriginal-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indigenous peoples in Brazil\n\nThe Amerindians make up 0.4% of Brazil's population, or about 700,000 people. Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although the majority of them live in Indian reservations in the North and Centre-Western part of the country. Over 60 million Brazilians possess at least one Native South American ancestor, according to a mitochondrial DNA study.[84]\n\n\nHowever, only 0.4% of the population consider themselves to be Natives. Brazilians tend to consider \"Native South American\" a cultural, not racial category. When the first Portuguese arrived in Brazil, in 1500, there were between 2.5 and 3.2 million Natives living in the country. In the mid-19th century they were only 100,000 and in the late 20th century close to 300,000.\n\n\n\n## Genetic studies[edit]\n\n\nGenetic studies have shown the Brazilian population as a whole to have European, African and Native American components.\n\n\n\n### Autosomal DNA studies[edit]\n\n\nA 2015 autosomal DNA genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).[85]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[85] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 16%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 58%\n | 27%\n | 15%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 64%\n | 24%\n | 12%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 67%\n | 23%\n | 10%\n |\n| South Region | 77%\n | 12%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal DNA study (2011), with nearly 1000 samples from every major race group (\"whites\", \"pardos\" and \"blacks\", according to their respective proportions) all over the country found out a major European contribution, followed by a high African contribution and an important Native American component.[86]\n\n\n\"In all regions studied, the European ancestry was predominant, with proportions ranging from 60.6% in the Northeast to 77.7% in the South\". The 2011 autosomal study samples came from blood donors (the lowest classes constitute the great majority of blood donors in Brazil[87]), and also public health institutions personnel and health students.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Region[86] | European\n | African\n | Native American\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Northern Brazil | 68.80%\n | 10.50%\n | 18.50%\n |\n| Northeast Brazil | 69.10%\n | 18.30%\n | 12.40%\n |\n| Southeast Brazil | 74.20%\n | 17.30%\n | 7.30%\n |\n| Southern Brazil | 79.50%\n | 10.30%\n | 9.40%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a predominant degree of European ancestry combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees. 'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban\npopulations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.[88]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[89] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 17%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 61%\n | 26%\n | 13%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 58%\n | 26%\n | 16%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 61%\n | 27%\n | 12%\n |\n| South Region | 74%\n | 15%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal DNA study from 2009 found a similar profile: \"all the Brazilian samples (regions) lie more closely to the European group than to the African populations or to the Mestizos from Mexico\".[90]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[91] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 60.6%\n | 21.3%\n | 18.1%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 68.3%\n | 21.1%\n | 10.6%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 66.3%\n | 21.7%\n | 12.0%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 60.7%\n | 32.0%\n | 7.3%\n |\n| South Region | 81.5%\n | 9.3%\n | 9.2%\n |\n\n\nA 2015 autosomal genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).[85]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[85] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 16%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 61%\n | 23%\n | 16%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 64%\n | 24%\n | 12%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 67%\n | 23%\n | 10%\n |\n| South Region | 77%\n | 12%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nPairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bioanthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations\".[92]\n\n\nAccording to another autosomal DNA study from 2008, by the University of Brasília (UnB), European ancestry dominates in the whole of Brazil (in all regions), accounting for 65.90% of heritage of the population, followed by the African contribution (24.80%) and the Native American (9.3%).[93]\n\n\nSão Paulo state, the most populous state in Brazil, with about 40 million people, showed the following composition, according to an autosomal study from 2006: European genes account for 79% of the heritage of the people of São Paulo, 14% are of African origin, and 7% Native American.[94] A study from 2013 found the following composition in São Paulo state: 61.9% European, 25.5% African and 11.6% Native American.[95] Another study focused on highly admixed populations yielded similar results.[96]\n\n\n\n## Races and ethnicities by region[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Brazil socio-geographic division\n\n### South[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Centro-Sul\n\nThe South of Brazil is the region with the largest percentage of Europeans. According to the 2005 census, people of European ancestry account for 87% of the population.[82] In colonial times, this region had a very small population.\n\n\nThe region what is now Southern Brazil was originally settled by Amerindian peoples, mostly Guarani and Kaingangs.[97] Only a few settlers from São Paulo were living there. This situation made the region vulnerable to attacks from neighboring countries. This fact forced the King of Portugal to decide to populate the region. For this, settlers from the Portuguese Azores islands were sent to the coast in 1617.[98]\n\n\nTo stimulate the immigration to Brazil, the king offered several benefits for the Azorean couples. Between 1748 and 1756, six thousand Portuguese from the Azores moved to the coast of Santa Catarina. They were mainly newly married who were seeking a better life. At that time, the Azores were one of the poorest regions of Portugal.\n\n\nThey established themselves mainly in the Santa Catarina Island, nowadays the region of Florianópolis. Later, some couples moved to Rio Grande do Sul, where they established Porto Alegre, the capital. The Azoreans lived on fishing and agriculture, especially flour. They composed over half of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina's population in the late 18th century.[99] The state of Paraná was settled by colonists from São Paulo due to their proximity (Paraná was part of São Paulo until the mid-19th century).\n\n\nWith the development of cattle in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul, African slaves began arriving in large numbers. By 1822, Africans were 50% of Rio Grande do Sul's population. This number decreased to 25% in 1858 and to only 5.2% in 2005. Most of them came from Angola.[100]\n\n\nAfter independence from Portugal (1822) the Brazilian government started to stimulate the arrival of a new wave of immigrants to settle the South. In 1824 they established São Leopoldo, a German community. Major Schaeffer, a German who was living in Brazil, was sent to Germany in order to bring immigrants. From Rhineland-Palatinate, the Major brought the immigrants and soldiers. Settlers from Germany were brought to work as small farmers, because there were many land holdings without workers.[101]\n\n\nTo attract the immigrants, the Brazilian government had promised large tracts of land, where they could settle with their families and colonize the region. The first years were not easy. Many Germans died of tropical disease, while others left the colonies to find better living conditions. The German colony of São Leopoldo was a disaster. Nevertheless, in the following years, a further 4,830 Germans arrived at São Leopoldo, and then the colony started to develop, with the immigrants establishing the town of Novo Hamburgo (*New Hamburg*).[102]\n\n\nFrom São Leopoldo and Novo Hamburgo, the German immigrants spread into others areas of Rio Grande do Sul, mainly close to sources of rivers. The whole region of Vale dos Sinos was populated by Germans. During the 1830s and part of the 1840s German immigration to Brazil was interrupted due to conflicts in the country (Ragamuffin War). The immigration restarted after 1845 with the creation of new colonies. The most important ones were Blumenau, in 1850, and Joinville in 1851, both in Santa Catarina state; these attracted thousands of German immigrants to the region.\nIn the next five decades, other 28 thousand Germans were brought to Rio Grande do Sul to work as small farmers in the countryside.[103] By 1914, it is estimated that 50 thousand Germans settled in this state.\n\n\nAnother immigration boom to this region started in 1875. Communities with Italian immigrants were also created in southern Brazil. The first colonies to be populated by Italians were created in the highlands of Rio Grande do Sul (Serra Gaúcha). These were Garibaldi and Bento Gonçalves. These immigrants were predominantly from Veneto, in northern Italy. After five years, in 1880, the great numbers of Italian immigrants arriving caused the Brazilian government to create another Italian colony, Caxias do Sul. After initially settling in the government-promoted colonies, many of the Italian immigrants spread themselves into other areas of Rio Grande do Sul seeking further opportunities.[104]\n\n\nThey created many other Italian colonies on their own, mainly in highlands, because the lowlands were already populated by Germans and native *gaúchos*. The Italian established many vineyards in the region. Nowadays, the wine produced in these areas of Italian colonization in southern Brazil is much appreciated within the country, though little is available for export. In 1875, the first Italian colonies were established in Santa Catarina, which lies immediately to the north of Rio Grande do Sul. The colonies gave rise to towns such as Criciúma, and later also spread further north, to Paraná.\n\n\nA significant number of Poles have settled in Southern Brazil. The first immigrants arrived in 1869 and until 1959, it is estimated that over 100,000 Poles migrated to Brazil,[105] 95% of whom were peasants. The State of Paraná received the majority of Polish immigrants, who settled mainly in the region of Curitiba, in the towns of Mallet, Cruz Machado, São Matheus do Sul, Irati, and União da Vitória.[106]\n\n\n\n### Southeast[edit]\n\n\nThe Southeastern region of Brazil is the most ethnically diverse part of the country. Europeans make up 55.16% of its population, those of mixed-race 35.69%, and African descent 7.91%. It has the largest percentage of Asian Brazilians, composing 0.8%, and a small Amerindian community (0.2%).\n\n\nSoutheast Brazil is home to the oldest Portuguese village in the Americas, São Vicente, São Paulo, established in 1532.[107] The region, since the beginning of its colonization, is a melting pot of Africans, Natives, and Europeans. The Indigenous peoples of the region were enslaved by the Portuguese.\n\n\nThe race mixing between the indigenous females and their European masters produced the Bandeirante, the colonial inhabitant of São Paulo, who formed expeditions that crossed the interior of Brazil and greatly increased the Portuguese colonial territory. The main language spoken by these people of mixed Indian/Portuguese heritage was Língua geral, a language that mixed Tupi and Portuguese words.\n\n\nIn the late 17th century the Bandeirantes found gold in the area that nowadays is Minas Gerais. A gold rush took place in Brazil and thousands of Portuguese colonists arrived during this period. The confrontation between the Bandeirantes and the Portuguese for obtaining possession of the mines led to the Emboabas' War.\n\n\nThe Portuguese won the war. The Amerindian culture declined, giving space to a stronger Portuguese cultural domination. In order to control the wealth, the Portuguese Crown moved the capital of Brazil from Salvador, Bahia to Rio de Janeiro. Thousands of African slaves were brought to work in the gold mines.\n\n\nThey were landed in Rio de Janeiro and sent to other regions. By the late 18th century, Rio de Janeiro was an \"African city\": most of its inhabitants were slaves. No other place in the world had as many slaves since the end of the Roman Empire.[108] In 1808 the Portuguese royal family, fleeing from Napoleon, took charge in Rio de Janeiro. Some 15,000 Portuguese nobles moved to Brazil. The region changed a lot, becoming more European.\n\n\nAfter independence and principally after 1850, Southeast Brazil was \"inundated\" by European immigrants, who were attracted by the government to replace the African slaves in the coffee plantations. Most immigrants landed in the Port of Santos and have been forwarded to the coffee farms within São Paulo.\n\n\nThe vast majority of the immigrants came from Italy. Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953. The large number of Italians are visible in many parts of Southeast Brazil. Their descendants are nowadays predominant in many areas. For example, Northeast São Paulo is 45% Italian.[109]\n\n\nThe arrival of immigrants from several parts of Europe, the Middle-East and Asia produced an ethnically diverse population. The city of Bastos, in São Paulo, is 11.4% Japanese. The city of São Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan itself.\n[110]\n\n\n\n### Northeast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Nordeste (socio-geographic division)\n\nThe population of Northeast Brazil is a result of an intensive race mixing, which has occurred in the region for more than four centuries. According to the 2006 census people reported as \"Pardo\" (Multiracial) make up 60.5% of the population. Those reported as African account for 5.9%.\n\n\nThis region did not have much effect from the massive European immigration that took place in Southern Brazil in the late 19th century and first decades of the 20th century. The Northeast has been a poorer region of Brazil since the decline of sugar cane plantations in the late 17th century, so its economy did not require immigrants.\n\n\nThe ethnic composition of the population starts in the 16th century. The Portuguese settlers rarely brought women, which led to relationships with the Indian women. Later, interracial relationships occurred between Portuguese males and African females. The coast, in the past the place where millions of African slaves arrived (mostly from modern-day Angola, Ghana, Nigeria and Benin) to work in sugar-cane plantations, is where nowadays there is a predominance of Mulattoes, those of African and European ancestry. Salvador, Bahia is considered the largest African city outside of Africa, with over 80% of its inhabitants being African-Brazilians. In the interior, there is a predominance of Indian and European mixture.[111]\n\n\n\n### North[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Amazônia Legal\n\nNorthern Brazil, largely covered by the Amazon rainforest, is the Brazilian region with the largest Amerindian influences, both in culture and ethnicity. Inhabited by diverse indigenous tribes, this part of Brazil was reached by Portuguese and Spanish colonists in the 17th century, but it started to be populated by non-Indians only in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The exploitation of rubber used in the growing industries of automobiles, has emerged a huge migration to the region.\n\n\nMany people from the poor Northeast Brazil, mostly Ceará, moved to the Amazon area. The contact between the Indians and the northeastern rubbers created the base of the ethnic composition of the region, with its mixed-race majority.\n\n\n\n### Central-West[edit]\n\n\nThe Central-West region of Brazil was inhabited by diverse Indians when the Portuguese arrived in the early 18th century. The Portuguese came to explore the precious stones that were found there. Contact between the Portuguese and the Indians created a mixed-race population. Until the mid-20th century, Central-West Brazil had a very small population. The situation changed with the construction of Brasília, the new capital of Brazil, in 1960. Many workers were attracted to the region, mostly from northeastern Brazil.\n\n\nA new wave of settlers started arriving from the 1970s. With the mechanization of agriculture in the South of Brazil, many rural workers of German and Italian origin migrated to Central-West Brazil. In some areas, they are already the majority of the population.\n\n\n\n## Education and health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Brazil and Health care in Brazil\n\nThe Federal Constitution of 1988 and the 1996 *General Law of Education in Brazil* (LDB) attributed to the Federal Government, states, Federal District and municipalities the responsibility of managing the Brazilian educational system, considering three educational public systems as a basis for collaboration between these federal systems.\n\n\nEach of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as mechanisms and sources for financial resources. The new Constitution reserves 25% of state and municipal taxes and 18% of federal taxes for education.[112]\n\n\nAs set out by the Brazilian Constitution, the main responsibility for basic education is attributed to the states and municipalities. Hence, a historical feature of Brazilian basic education is its extremely decentralized nature, which gives great organizational autonomy to sub-national governments (27 states and 5,546 municipalities) in organizing their educational systems.\n\n\nEarly childhood education, from 0–6 years, is under exclusive responsibility of the municipalities. Responsibility for compulsory primary education from 1st to 9th grades is shared between states and municipalities. Kindergarten and pre-school education are the responsibility of local levels of government, whereas secondary schools are under the responsibility of the states.\n\n\nMaintenance of the system, including salaries, the definition of teacher career structures and supervision of early childhood, primary, and secondary levels (which make up basic education) is decentralized, and these levels are responsible for defining their respective curriculum content.\n\n\nHigher education starts with undergraduate or sequential courses, which may offer different specialization choices such as academic or vocational paths. Depending on the choice, students may improve their educational background with *Stricto Sensu* or *Lato Sensu* postgraduate courses.\n\n\nHigher education has three main purposes: teaching, research and extension, each with their own specific contribution to make to a particular course. Diplomas and certificates are proof of having passed through higher education.\n\n\nAccording to Brazilian Government, the most serious health problems are:[113]\n\n\n\n* Childhood mortality: about 2.51% of childhood mortality, reaching 3.77% in the northeast region.\n* Motherhood mortality: about 73.1 deaths per 100,000 born children in 2002.\n* Mortality by non-transmissible illness: 151.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by heart and circulatory diseases, along with 72.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by cancer.\n* Mortality caused by external causes (transportation, violence and suicide): 71.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants (14.9% of all deaths in the country), reaching 82.3 deaths in the southeast region.\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Brazil\n\nAccording to the IBGE census 2010[114] 64.6% are Roman Catholics; 24% are Protestants and other Christians, 8% are agnostics, atheists or have no religion, 2% are followers of Spiritism, and 1% are members of other religions. Some of these religions are Jehovah's Witnesses (1,100,000), Latter-day Saints (200,000), Buddhism (215,000), Judaism (86,000), and Islam (27,000).[115]\n\n\nBrazil has the largest Roman Catholic population in the world.[116]\n\n\nFollowers of Protestantism are rising in number. Until 1970, the majority of Brazilian Protestants were adherents of \"traditional churches\", mostly Lutherans, Presbyterians and Baptists. There are 120,000 Episcopalians in 9 dioceses (Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil). Since then, numbers of Pentecostal and Neopentecostal adherents have increased significantly.\n\n\nIslam in Brazil was first practiced by African slaves.[117] The Muslim population in Brazil is made up mostly of Arab immigrants.[118]\n\n\nThe largest population of Buddhists in Latin America lives in Brazil, due greatly to Brazil's large Japanese population.\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Languages of Brazil and Portuguese language\n\nPortuguese is the only official language of Brazil.[119] It is spoken by nearly the entire population and is virtually the only language used in schools, newspapers, radio, TV and for all business and administrative purposes. Moreover, Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity.\n\n\nMany Amerindian languages are spoken daily in indigenous communities, primarily in Northern Brazil. Although many of these communities have significant contact with Portuguese,[120] there are incentives stimulating preservation and the teaching of native languages. According to SIL International, 133 Native American languages are currently endangered. Some of the largest indigenous language groups include Arawak, Carib, Macro-Gê and Tupi.[121] In 2006, the City of São Gabriel da Cachoeira in the region of Cabeça do Cachorro (Northwestern region of the State of Amazonas), has adopted some indigenous languages as some of its other official languages along with Portuguese.\n\n\nOther languages are spoken by descendants of immigrants, who are usually bilingual, in small rural communities in Southern Brazil. The most important are the Brazilian German dialects, such as Riograndenser Hunsrückisch and the East Pomeranian dialect, and also the Talian, based on the Italian Venetian language. There are also bilingual speakers of Polish, Ukrainian and Russian in Southern Brazil, especially Paraná. In the city of São Paulo, Levantine, Japanese, Chinese and Korean can be heard in the immigrant neighborhoods, such as Liberdade. Yiddish and Hebrew are used by Jewish communities mainly in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, Brasília, Belo Horizonte and Recife as well as the Vlax Romani dialect by Romani communities all across the nation.\n\n\n\n## *The World Factbook* demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from *The World Factbook*, unless otherwise indicated[122]\n\n\n\n### Nationality[edit]\n\n\n* noun: Brazilian(s)\n* adjective: Brazilian\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n* 217,650,530\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\n* Portuguese (official)\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\n* European | mainly Portuguese 47.6%\n* Caboclo, Castizo 23.1%\n* Mulatto, Quadroon, Octoroon 21%\n* Black Brazilians 7.0%\n* Asian (mainly Japanese) 1.2%\n* Indigenous 0.4%\n* Romani 0.4%\n* Eurasian, Hafu 0.3%\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\n* Total population: 94.4%\n* Male: 92.4%\n* Female: 96.4% (2019 est.)\n\n\n### Religions[edit]\n\n\n* Roman Catholic 64.6%\n* Other Catholic 0.4%\n* Protestant 22.2%\n\t+ Adventist (including Seventh-day Adventist and Adventist Church of Promise) 6.5%\n\t+ Assembly of God 2.0%\n\t+ Christian Congregation of Brazil 1.2%\n\t+ Universal Church of the Kingdom of God 1.0%\n\t+ Other Protestant 11.5%\n\t+ Other Christian 0.7%\n* Spiritist 2.2%\n* Other 1.4%\n* None 8%\n* Unspecified 0.4%\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Brazil\n* 2022 Brazilian census\n* Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n* Demographics of Rio de Janeiro\n* List of largest cities in Brazil\n* Racial democracy\n* *Brazilian Journal of Population Studies*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** População do Brasil – IBGE\n2. **^** \"Censo Demográfi co 20200 Características da população e dos domicílios Resultados do universo\" (PDF). 8 November 2021.

According to the most recent data, Germany's population is 84,432,670 (31 March 2023)[1] making it the most populous country in the European Union and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.58 in 2021,[6] significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1. For a long time Germany had one of the world's lowest fertility rates of around 1.3 to 1.4, however there has been a small increase in recent years.[7] Due to the low birth rate Germany has recorded more deaths than births every year since 1972,[8] which means 2021 was the 50th consecutive year the German population would have decreased without immigration. However, due to immigration the population has actually increased during the last half-century. In 2019 the number of people with a foreign background was 26%;[9] this category includes foreigners, naturalized citizens, ethnic German repatriates from Eastern Europe and the children of all of the above.\n\n\nUntil the early 20th century Germany was also a large emigrant nation; in the 19th century more than 5 million citizens of the German Empire emigrated to the US alone, and in the early 20th century Germany lost another two million to the US as well as significant numbers to Latin America, Canada and Eastern Europe. However, after World War II immigration began to outweigh emigration, as around 14 million ethnic Germans were expelled from the former eastern provinces of the Reich and other areas in Eastern Europe. Of these, roughly 12 million made their way to present-day Germany and several hundred thousand settled in Austria and other countries, while several hundred thousand died. Some additional 4.5 million ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe repatriated after 1950, especially around the end of the Eastern Bloc and mostly from the former Soviet Union, Poland and Romania.[10][11]\n\n\nLarge-scale immigration to West Germany began during the time of the Wirtschaftswunder from the 1950s to early 1970s when Germany had a shortage of workers and let in Southern Europeans from countries like Turkey, Italy and Spain on a temporary basis as guest workers. The liberalisation of guest worker legislation allowed many to stay and build a life in West Germany. Germany saw another large wave of immigration towards the end of the 20th century, driven by German reunification, refugee inflows from the Yugoslav Wars and large numbers of Turkish nationals seeking asylum. The next large immigration wave began after eastern expansion of the European Union in 2011 as Eastern Europeans were now allowed to live and work in Germany without a visa. During the European migrant crisis of the mid 2010s Germany took in a large number of refugees, both in absolute terms and relative to other EU member states; the country recorded 476,649 asylum seekers in 2015, 745,545 in 2016 and declining numbers thereafter.[12]\n\n\nGermany has one of the world's highest levels of education, technological development, and economic productivity. Since the end of World War II, the number of students entering university has more than tripled, and the trade and technical schools are among the world's best. With a per capita income of about €40,883 in 2018,[13] Germany is a broadly middle-class society. However, there has been a strong increase in the number of children living in poverty. In 1965, one in 75 children was on the welfare rolls; but by 2007 this had increased to one child in six. These children live in relative poverty, but not necessarily in absolute poverty.[14] Millions of Germans travel overseas each year. The social welfare system provides for universal health care, unemployment compensation, child benefits and other social programmes. Germany's aging population and struggling economy strained the welfare system in the 1990s, so the government adopted a wide-ranging programme of – still controversial – belt-tightening reforms, Agenda 2010, including the labour-market reforms known as Hartz concept.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1945–1990[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population evolution of Germany, since 1950\nAfter the World War II border shifts and expulsions, the Germans from Central and Eastern Europe and the former eastern territories moved westward to post-war Germany. During the partition of Germany, many Germans from East Germany fled to West Germany for political and economic reasons. Since Germany's reunification, there are ongoing migrations from the eastern *New Länder* to the western *Old Länder* for economic reasons.\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic followed different paths when it came to demographics. The politics of the German Democratic Republic was pronatalistic[15] while that of the Federal Republic was compensatory.\n\n\nFertility in the GDR was higher than that in the FRG. Demographic politics was only one of the reasons. Women in the GDR had fewer \"biographic options\", young motherhood was expected of them. State funded costfree childcare was available to all mothers.[16]\n\n\n\nMother's mean age at first birth in East and West Germany\n\nNote: Berlin is included into East Germany for the year 2002 and 2008.

This has been attributed to a \"demographic shock\": people not only had fewer children, they were also less likely to marry or divorce after the end of the GDR; the biographic options of the citizens of the former GDR had increased. Young motherhood seemed to be less attractive and the age of the first birth rose sharply.[16]\n\n\nIn the following years, the TFR in the East started to rise again, surpassing 1.0 in 1997 and 1.3 in 2004, and reaching the West's TFR (1.37) in 2007. In 2010, the East's fertility rate (1.459) clearly exceeded that of the West (1.385), while Germany's overall TFR had risen to 1.393, the highest value since 1990,[20][21] which was still far below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 and the birth rates seen under communism. In 2016, the TFR was 1.64 in the East and 1.60 in the West.[22]\n\n\nBetween 1989 and 2009, about 2,000 schools closed because there were fewer children.[18]\n\n\nIn some regions the number of women between the ages of 20 and 30 has dropped by more than 30%.[18] In 2004, in the age group 18–29 (statistically important for starting families) there were only 90 women for every 100 men in the new federal states (the East, including Berlin).\n\n\nUntil 2007 family politics in the federal republic was compensatory, which means that poor families received more family benefits (such as the *Erziehungsgeld*) than rich ones. In 2007 the so-called *Elterngeld* was introduced. According to Christoph Butterwegge the Elterngeld was meant to \"motivate highly educated women to have more children\"; the poor on the other hand were disadvantaged by the *Elterngeld*, and now received lower child benefits than the middle classes.[23] The very well-off (who earn more than 250.000 Euro per annum) and those on welfare receive no Elterngeld payments.[24]\n\n\nIn 2013 the following most recent developments were noticed:[25]\n\n\n\n* The income of families with young children has risen. Persons holding a college degree, persons older than 30 years and parents with only one child benefited the most. Single parents and young parents did not benefit.\n* Fathers are becoming more involved in parenting, and 28% of them now take some time off work (3.3 months on average) when their children are born.\n* Mothers are more likely to work and as a result less likely to be economically deprived than they used to be.\n* The birth rate of college-educated women has risen.\n\n\nIn the new federal states the fertility rate of college-educated women is now higher than that of those without college degrees. Differences in value priorities and the better availability of childcare in the eastern states are discussed as possible reasons.[26]\n\n\nIn 2019, the non-profit Austrian Institute of Economic Research and the Bertelsmann Stiftung published a study about the economic impact of demographics. The researchers assume a reduction in the per capita income of €3,700 until 2040.[27]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Census in Germany\n\n![](image)Historical population of Germany\nThe contemporary demographics of Germany used to also be measured by a series of full censuses mandated by the state, with the most recent held in 1987. Since reunification, German authorities rely on a *micro census*.\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review.[28] Due to the privacy concerns of the German population after reunification, Germany did not hold a regular census until the EU-mandated 2011 German Census. The requirement was met with large disapproval. As required by the EU, Germany now continues to hold censuses every 10 years.[29]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 43 seconds\n* One death every 34 seconds\n* Net gain of one person every 4 minutes\n* One net migrant every 2 minutes\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Out of 778,080 births in 2019, 258,835 were to unmarried parents,[47] which means that around 33% or one third of the children are born out of wedlock, while two thirds are within. This percentage of unmarried birth has long been growing and reached 33% in 2010, more than twice of what it was in 1990.[48] However in recent years it has started to stagnate or even decrease.[49]\n\n\nThe Mikrozensus done in 2008 revealed that the number of children a German woman aged 40 to 75 had, was closely linked to her educational achievement.[50]\nIn Western Germany the most educated women were the most likely to be childless. 26% of those groups stated they were childless, while 16% of those having an intermediate education, and 11% of those having compulsory education, stated the same.\nIn Eastern Germany however, 9% of the most educated women of that age group and 7% of those who had an intermediary education were childless, while 12% of those having only compulsory education were childless.\n\n\nThe reason for that east-western difference is that the GDR had an \"educated mother scheme\" and actively tried to encourage first births among the more educated. It did so by propagandizing the opinion that every educated woman should \"present at least one child to socialism\" and also by financially rewarding its more educated citizen to become parents. The government especially tried to persuade students to become parents while still in college and it was quite successful in doing so. In 1986 38% of all women, who were about to graduate from college, were mothers of at least one child and additional 14% were pregnant and 43% of all men, who were about to graduate from college, were fathers of at least one child. There was a sharp decline in the birth rate and especially in the birth rate of the educated after the fall of the Berlin wall. Nowadays,[*when?*] 5% of those about to graduate from college are parents.\n\n\nThe more educated a Western German mother aged 40 to 75 was in 2008, the less likely she was to have a big family.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Percent of Western German mothers having 1, 2 and 3 or more children by educational attainment\n |\n| --- |\n| number of children\n | compulsory education\n | intermediary education\n | highest education\n |\n| one child | 22 | 30 | 31\n |\n| two children | 39 | 48 | 48\n |\n| three or more children | 39 | 22 | 21\n |\n| [51] |\n\n\nThe same was true for a mother living in Eastern Germany in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Percent of Eastern German mothers having 1, 2 and 3 and more children by educational attainment\n |\n| --- |\n| number of children\n | compulsory education\n | intermediary education\n | highest education\n |\n| one child | 23 | 33 | 33\n |\n| two children | 37 | 46 | 51\n |\n| three or more children | 40 | 21 | 16\n |\n| [51] |\n\n\nIn 2011, this trend was reversed in Eastern Germany, where more highly educated women now had a somewhat higher fertility rate than the rest of the population.[52]\n\n\nPersons who said they had no religion tend to have fewer children than those who identify as Christians, and studies also found that conservative-leaning Christians had more children compared to liberal-leaning Christians.[53][54]\n\n\nA study done in 2005 in the western German state of Nordrhein-Westfalen by the HDZ revealed that childlessness was especially widespread among scientists. It showed that 78% of the women scientists and 71% of the male scientists working in that state were childless.[55]\n\n\n\n### Homelessness[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Homelessness in Germany.[edit]\nHomelessness in Germany is a significant social issue, one that is estimated to affect around 678,000 people.[56] This figure includes about 372,000 people that are accommodated (in refugee shelters, etc.) by public services, e.g. by the municipalities.[57] Since 2014, there has been a 150% increase in the homeless population within the country.[58] Reportedly, around 22,000 of the homeless population are children.[56][*citation needed*]\n\n\n\nIn addition, the country has yet to publish statistics on homelessness at a Federal Level[59] despite it being an ongoing and widespread matter.\n\n## Ethnic minorities and migrant background (*Migrationshintergrund*)[edit]\n\n\nGermany does not collect data on the ethnic and racial identifications of its citizens, but does collect data on the background group by birth of an individual.[60] The Federal Statistical Office defines persons with a migrant background as all persons who migrated to the present area of the Federal Republic of Germany after 1949, plus all foreign nationals born in Germany and all persons born in Germany as German nationals with at least one parent who migrated to Germany or was born in Germany as a foreign national. The figures presented here are based on this definition only.\n\n\nIn 2010, 2.3 million families with children under 18 years were living in Germany, in which at least one parent had foreign roots. They represented 29% of the total of 8.1 million families with minor children. Compared with 2005 – the year when the microcensus started to collect detailed information on the population with a migrant background – the proportion of migrant families has risen by 2 percentage points.[61] In 2019, 40% children under 5 years old had migrant background.[62]\n\n\nMost of the families with a migrant background live in the western part of Germany. In 2010, the proportion of migrant families in all families was 32% in the former territory of the Federal Republic. This figure was more than double that in the new Länder (incl. Berlin) where it stood at 15%.[61] Eastern Germany has a much lower proportion of immigrants than the West, as the GDR did not let in that many guest workers and Eastern Germany's economy is not doing as well as West Germany's and had a higher percentage of jobless persons until recently. However in recent years the number of people with an immigrant background in East Germany has been growing as refugees (as well as German Repatriates) are distributed with the Königssteiner Schlüssel, so every German state has to take the same number of them compared to its population and economy. In 2019 19.036 million people or 89,6% of people with an immigrant background live in Western Germany (excluding Berlin), being 28,7% of its population, while 1.016 million people with immigrant background 4,8% live in Eastern States, being 8,2% of population, and 1.194 million people with an immigrant background 5,6% live in Berlin, being 33,1% of its population.[62]\n\n\nIn 2019, 26% of Germans of any age group (up from 18,4% in 2008) and 39% of German children (up from 30% in 2008) had at least one parent born abroad. Average age for Germans with at least one parent born abroad was 35.6 years (up from 33.8 years in 2008), while that for Germans, who had two parents born in Germany was 47.3 years (up from 44.6 in 2008).[62][63]\n\n\nIn 2022, 41 percent of the under-15 age group had a migrant background, 36 percent of the 15 to 49-year-old age group had a migrant background and 19 percent of the age group above (50+).[64]\n\n\nThe largest groups of people with an immigrant background in Germany are people that have Turkey, Poland and Russia as their ancestral homelands.\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the population by background was as follows:\n\n\n\n![](image)Major groups which reside in Germany by ancestry as of 2019\n**Population of Germany in 2022**\n\n\n\nGermans[65] (71.3%)\nTurkish

they have lived in their respective regions for centuries: Danes, Frisians, Roma and Sinti, and Sorbs. There is a Danish minority (about 50,000, according to government sources) in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein. Eastern and Northern Frisians live at Schleswig-Holstein's western coast, and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony. They are part of a wider community (Frisia) stretching from Germany to the northern Netherlands. The Sorbs, a Slavic people with about 60,000 members (according to government sources), are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg. They are the last remnants of the Slavs that lived in central and eastern Germany since the 7th century to have kept their traditions and not been completely integrated into the wider German nation.\n\n\nUntil World War II the Poles were recognized as one of the national minorities. In 1924 the Union of Poles in Germany had initiated cooperation between all national minorities in Germany under the umbrella organization Association of National Minorities in Germany. Some of the union members wanted the Polish communities in easternmost Germany (now Poland) to join the newly established Polish nation after World War I.[70] Even before the German invasion of Poland, leading anti-Nazi members of the Polish minority were deported to concentration camps; some were executed at the Piaśnica murder site. Minority rights for Poles in Germany were revoked by Hermann Göring's World War II decree of 27 February 1940, and their property was confiscated.\n\n\nAfter the war ended, the German government did not re-implement national minority rights for ethnic Poles. The reason for this is that the areas of Germany which formerly had a native Polish minority were annexed to Poland and the Soviet Union, while almost all of the native German populations (formerly the ethnic majority) in these areas subsequently fled or were expelled by force. With the mixed German-Polish territories now lost, the German government subsequently regarded ethnic Poles residing in what remained of Germany as immigrants, just like any other ethnic population with a recent history of arrival. In contrast, Germans living in Poland are recognized as national minority and have granted seats in Polish Parliament. It must be said, however, that an overwhelming number of Germans in Poland have centuries-old historical ties to the lands they now inhabit, whether from living in territory that once belonged to the German state, or from centuries-old communities. In contrast, most Poles in present-day Germany are recent immigrants, though there are some communities which have been present since the 19th and perhaps even the 18th centuries. Despite protests by some in the older Polish-German communities, and despite Germany being now a signatory to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Germany has so far refused to re-implement minority rights for ethnic Poles, based on the fact that almost all areas of historically mixed German-Polish heritage (where the minority rights formerly existed) are no longer part of Germany and because the vast majority of ethnic Poles now residing in Germany are recent immigrants.\n\n\nRoma people have been in Germany since the Middle Ages. They were persecuted by the Nazis, and thousands of Roma living in Germany were killed by the Nazi regime. Nowadays, they are spread all over Germany, mostly living in major cities. It is difficult to estimate their exact number, as the German government counts them as \"persons without migrant background\" in their statistics. There are also many assimilated Sinti and Roma. A vague figure given by the German Department of the Interior is about 70,000. In contrast to the old-established Roma population, the majority of them do not have German citizenship, and are classified as immigrants or refugees.\n\n\n\n![](image)A family of so-called \"Spätaussiedler\" (repatriates of ethnic German origin), because the parents were born abroad they will be counted as \"persons with immigrant background\"\nAfter World War II, 14 million ethnic Germans were expelled from the eastern territories of Germany and homelands outside the former German Empire. The accommodation and integration of these *Heimatvertriebene* in the remaining part of Germany, in which many cities and millions of apartments had been destroyed, was a major effort in the post-war occupation zones and later states of Germany.\n\n\nSince the 1960s, ethnic Germans from the People's Republic of Poland and Soviet Union (especially from Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine), have come to Germany. During the time of Perestroika, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the number of immigrants increased heavily. Some of these immigrants are of mixed ancestry. During the 10-year period between 1987 and 2001, a total of 1,981,732 ethnic Germans from the FSU immigrated to Germany, along with more than a million of their non-German relatives. After 1997, however ethnic Slavs or those belonging to Slavic-Germanic mixed origins outnumbered those with only Germanic descent amongst the immigrants. The total number of people currently living in Germany having FSU connection is around 4 to 4.5 million (Including Germans, Slavs, Jews, and those of mixed origins), out of that more than 50% are of German descent.[71][72]\n\n\nGermany now has Europe's third-largest Jewish population. In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total inflow to more than 100,000 since 1991.[73] Jews have a voice in German public life through the Central Council of Jews in Germany (Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland). Some Jews from the former Soviet Union are of mixed heritage. Today, less than 0.1% of the total population of Germany is Jewish.\n\n\n  \n\nIn 2019 there were also a growing number of at least 529,000 black Afro-Germans defined as people with an African migrant background.[62] Out of them more than 400 thousand have a citizenship of a Subsahara-African country,[74] with others being German citizens. Most of them live in Berlin and Hamburg. Numerous persons from northern African Tunisia and Morocco live in Germany. While they are considered members of a minority group, for the most part, they do not considers themselves \"Afro-Germans,\" nor are most of them perceived as such by the German people. However, Germany does not keep any statistics regarding ethnicity or race. Hence, the exact number of Germans of African descent is unknown.\n\n\nGermany's biggest East Asian minorities are the Chinese people in Germany, numbering 189,000[62]\nand Vietnamese people in Germany, numbering 188,000,[62] many of whom living in Berlin and eastern Germany.\nAlso there are about 35,000 Japanese citizens residing in Germany.[75] There are also groups of South Asian and Southeast Asian immigrants. Around 163,000 Indians and 124,000 Pakistanis live in Germany.[62] Additionally some 30,000 Filipino citizens and more than 20,000 Indonesian citizens reside in Germany.[75]\n\n\nNumerous descendants of the so-called *Gastarbeiter* live in Germany. The *Gastarbeiter* mostly came from Turkey, Italy, Greece, Spain, Morocco, Portugal, the former Yugoslavia, Tunisia and Chile.\nAlso included were Vietnam, Mongolia, North Korea, Angola, Mozambique and Cuba when the former East Germany existed until reunification in 1990.[76] The (socialist) German Democratic Republic (East Germany) however had their guest-workers stay in single-sex dormitories.[77] Female guest workers had to sign contracts saying that they were not allowed to fall pregnant during their stay. If they fell pregnant nevertheless they faced forced abortion or deportation.[78] This is one of the reasons why the vast majority of ethnic minorities today lives in western Germany and also one of the reasons why minorities such as the Vietnamese have the most unusual population pyramid, with nearly all second-generation Vietnamese Germans born after 1989.\n\n\n\n![](image)Proportion of Germans without a migrant background (2016)\n![](image)Germany is home to the second-largest number of international migrants worldwide.[79][80] In 2016, around 23% of Germany's population do not hold a German passport or are descendants of immigrants.[81]\n## Foreign nationals in Germany[edit]\n\n\n![](image)German and foreign national population pyramid of Germany in 2021\nAs the end of 2022, the most common groups of resident foreign nationals in Germany were as follows:[82]\n\n\nThis list does not include non-ethnic Germans with German nationality and foreign nationals without resident status.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Nationality\n | Population (31.12.2022)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Total | 13,383,910\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Turkey | 1,487,110\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Ukraine | 1,164,200\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Syria | 923,805\n |\n| 4 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Romania | 883,670\n |\n| 5 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Poland | 880,780\n |\n| 6 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Italy | 644,970\n |\n| 7 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Croatia | 436,325\n |\n| 8 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Bulgaria | 429,665\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Afghanistan | 377,240\n |\n| 10 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Greece | 361,270\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) Russia | 290,615\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) Iraq | 284,595\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Kosovo | 280,850\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Serbia | 251,365\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina | 233,775\n |\n| 16 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Hungary | 214,695\n |\n| 17 | ![](image) India | 210,385\n |\n| 18 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Spain | 193,460\n |\n| 19 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Austria | 185,755\n |\n| 20 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Netherlands | 150,295\n |\n| 21 | ![](image) China | 149,550\n |\n| 22 | ![](image) North Macedonia | 146,380\n |\n| 23 | ![](image) Iran | 143,555\n |\n| 24 | ![European Union](image)![](image) France | 140,320\n |\n| 25 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Portugal | 139,435\n |\n| 26 | ![](image) United States | 121,420\n |\n| 27 | ![](image) Vietnam | 120,535\n |\n| 28 | ![](image) Albania | 108,555\n |\n| 29 | ![](image) Morocco | 95,095\n |\n| 30 | ![](image) United Kingdom | 84,605\n |\n\n\n## Population density and distribution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population density by municipality\nWith an estimated 83.2 million inhabitants in December 2020,[83] Germany is the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia, and ranks as the 19th largest country in the world in terms of population. Its population density stands at 233 inhabitants per square kilometer.\n\n\n\n### States[edit]\n\n\nGermany comprises sixteen states that are collectively referred to as *Länder*.[84] Due to differences in size and population the subdivision of these states varies, especially between city-states (*Stadtstaaten*) and states with larger territories (*Flächenländer*). For regional administrative purposes four states, namely Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia, consist of a total of 19 Government Districts (*Regierungsbezirke*). As of 2019 Germany is divided into 400 districts (*Kreise*) on municipal level, these consist of 294 rural districts and 106 urban districts.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![Lower Saxony](image) Lower Saxony\n\n![Free Hanseatic City of Bremen](image) Bremen\n\n![Hamburg](image) Hamburg\n\n![Mecklenburg-Vorpommern](image) Mecklenburg-  \nVorpommern\n\n![Saxony-Anhalt](image) Saxony-  \nAnhalt\n\n![Saxony](image) Saxony\n\n![Brandenburg](image) Brandenburg\n\n![Berlin](image) Berlin\n\n![Thuringia](image) Thuringia\n\n![Hesse](image) Hesse\n\n![North Rhine-Westphalia](image) North Rhine-  \nWestphalia\n\n![Rhineland-Palatinate](image) Rhineland-Palatinate\n\n![Bavaria](image) Bavaria\n\n![Baden-Württemberg](image) Baden-  \nWürttemberg\n\n![Saarland](image) Saarland\n\n![Schleswig-Holstein](image) Schleswig-Holstein\n\n![](image)Germany states by foreigners as percentage of population as of November 2020\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| State | Capital | Area(km2) | Population[85](31 December 2022)\n | Foreigners\n | Population density(per km2)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Rhine-Westphalia | Düsseldorf | 34,112 | 18,139,116 ![Increase](image) | 2,828,367 ![Increase](image) | 532\n |\n| Bavaria | Munich | 70,541 | 13,369,116 ![Increase](image) | 2,073,494 ![Increase](image) | 190\n |\n| Baden-Württemberg | Stuttgart | 35,748 | 11,280,257 ![Increase](image) | 2,012,237 ![Increase](image) | 316\n |\n| Lower Saxony | Hanover | 47,709 | 8,140,242 ![Increase](image) | 959,786 ![Increase](image) | 171\n |\n| Hesse | Wiesbaden | 21,116 | 6,391,360 ![Increase](image) | 1,199,775 ![Increase](image) | 303\n |\n| Rhineland-Palatinate | Mainz | 19,858 | 4,159,150 ![Increase](image) | 566,026 ![Increase](image) | 209\n |\n| Saxony | Dresden | 18,450 | 4,086,152 ![Increase](image) | 300,164 ![Increase](image) | 221\n |\n| Berlin | Berlin | 891 | 3,755,251 ![Increase](image) | 834,349 ![Increase](image) | 4,215\n |\n| Schleswig-Holstein | Kiel | 15,804 | 2,953,270 ![Increase](image) | 299,787 ![Increase](image) | 187\n |\n| Brandenburg | Potsdam | 29,654 | 2,573,135 ![Increase](image) | 179,872 ![Increase](image) | 87\n |\n| Saxony-Anhalt | Magdeburg | 20,454 | 2,186,643 ![Increase](image) | 160,990 ![Increase](image) | 107\n |\n| Thuringia | Erfurt | 16,202 | 2,126,846 ![Increase](image) | 161,291 ![Increase](image) | 131\n |\n| Hamburg | Hamburg | 755 | 1,892,122 ![Increase](image) | 363,283 ![Increase](image) | 2,506\n |\n| Mecklenburg-Vorpommern | Schwerin | 23,295 | 1,628,378 ![Increase](image) | 105,437 ![Increase](image) | 70\n |\n| Saarland | Saarbrücken | 2,571 | 992,666 ![Increase](image) | 139,189 ![Increase](image) | 386\n |\n| Bremen | Bremen | 419 | 684,864 ![Increase](image) | 144,148 ![Increase](image) | 1,634\n |\n| Germany | Berlin | 357,582 | 84,358,845 ![Increase](image) | 12,324,195 ![Increase](image) | 236\n |\n\n |\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of cities in Germany; List of cities in Germany with more than 100,000 inhabitants; and Metropolitan regions in Germany\n\nGermany officially has eleven metropolitan regions.

Included in the rather polycentric conurbation are the cities of Cologne, Düsseldorf, Bonn, Dortmund and Essen served by two of the country's largest airports Düsseldorf Airport and the Cologne Bonn Airport. Particularly among young Germans, Cologne and Düsseldorf are known for their nightlife and open-minded atmosphere.\n | approx. 10 million\n | Turks, Poles, Italians, Romanians, Africans, Arabs, Greeks, Dutch, Russians, Serbs, Bulgarians and Spaniards |\n| Berlin/Brandenburg | ![](image) | Berlin is the capital and largest city. It lies in the eastern part of the country, completely surrounded by the rather sparsely populated state of Brandenburg. Berlin is regarded as one of Europe's most open, vibrant and ever changing capitals. The city is arguably the most diverse city in Germany regarding culture and ethnicity. Regarded as an economically weak region of Germany for a long time, it is now transforming itself into the entrepreneurial center of Europe. Dubbed the \"Silicon Allee\" by insiders of the tech industry, Berlin is home to countless startup companies and one of Germany's densest knowledge hubs with 4 public universities and countless research centers.\n | approx. 6 million\n | Turks, Russians, Poles, Africans, Italians, Americans, Vietnamese, Serbs, Arabs, Bulgarians, Romanians, French and Spaniards |\n| Munich | ![](image) | The metropolitan area in and around Munich has one of Germany's highest standard of living. Housing some of the countries largest car and machine companies, it is known for its economic strength mixed with the uniqueness of Bavarian culture, taking up almost the entirety of southern Bavaria. It is the closest metropolitan area to the Alps.\n | approx. 5.7 million\n | Turks, Albanians, Croats, Italians, Poles, Greeks, Austrians, Romanians, Arabs, Africans and Serbs |\n| Rhine-Main | ![](image) | Frankfurt is the financial and commercial center both for Germany and continental Europe. Almost all of Germany's big banks and the ECB have their HQ located inside the city of Frankfurt. Despite not having a population of over a million, it is Germany's only city with a large, visible cluster of skyscrapers. The city is one of Europe's biggest transit hubs with Europe's 6th busiest airport (Frankfurt airport), Germany's second busiest railway stations and one of the EU's most heavily used interchanges.\n | approx. 5.5 million\n | Turks, Poles, Italians, African, Croats, Romanians, Greeks, Serbs, Spaniards, Americans, Chinese, Arabs and Indians |\n| Hamburg | ![](image) | Hamburg is the country's second largest city and the biggest Hanseatic city in Europe. It is Europe's 3rd busiest container port with just under 9 million TEUs annually. The city is proud of its diverse nightlife and music scene centered in and around the famous St. Pauli district.\n | approx. 5.3 million\n | Turks, Albanians, Poles, African, Portuguese, Romanians, Russians, Italians and Spaniards |\n| Stuttgart | ![](image) | Stuttgart has a reputation for research, inventions and industry. The German headquarters of many international enterprises are in Stuttgart. This contrasts with the strong rural, down-to-earth attitude of the Stuttgarters throughout the classes. A popular slogan is \"We are good at everything. Except speaking High (standard) German.\"\n | approx. 5.2 million\n | Turks, Albanians, Greeks, Dutch, Italians, Croats, Serbs, French, Chinese, Romanians, Americans and Spaniards.[*citation needed*] |\n| Hannover–Braunschweig–Göttingen–Wolfsburg | ![](image) | The relatively urban south of Lower Saxony, located on route between the Ruhr area and Berlin, and the route form Hamburg to the south, has been important for logistics, industry, but also developed a strong standing in the service industries.\n | approx. 3.7 million\n | Turks, Kurds (especially around Celle), Serbs, Ukrainians, Greeks, Russians, Italians (especially in Wolfsburg) and Spanish (Especially in Hanover).[*citation needed*] |\n| Bremen/Oldenburg | ![](image) | Located in the northwestern part of Germany, the main axis contains the cities of Bremen, Delmenhorst and Oldenburg, with the cities of Wilhelmshaven and Bremerhaven being the northern corners at the north sea. Major rural areas are covered in between these cities.

Since the 1960s, West and later reunified Germany has attracted immigrants primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Turkey, many of whom (or their children) have acquired German citizenship over time. While most of these immigrants initially arrived as guest workers, changes to guest worker legislation allowed many to stay and to build lives in Germany.\n\n\nGermany had signed special visa agreements with several countries in times of severe labour shortages or when particular skills were deficient within the country. During the 1960s and 1970s, agreements were signed with the governments of Turkey, Yugoslavia, Italy and Spain to help Germany overcome its severe labour shortage.\n\n\nAs of 2012, after Germany fully legalized visa-free immigrants from the eastern states of the EU, the largest sources of net immigration to Germany were other European countries, most importantly Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Spain, and Greece; notably, in the case of Turkey, German Turks moving to Turkey slightly outnumbered new immigrants in 2012,[87] however, in recent years there are more Turkish immigrants in Germany than emigrants again, including illegal Turkish migrants.\n\n\nIn 2015, there was a large increase in asylum applications following the 2015 refugee crisis, mainly due to the violent conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan: 476,649 asylum applications were counted that year.[88] This number went up to even 745,545 in 2016 and began to decline after it.[12]\n\n\nIn 2022, some 23.8 million people in Germany, or 28.7% of the population have migrant background.[89]\n\n\nFollowing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, over 1.06 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany as of April 2023.[90]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Germany\n\n![](image)Cadets of the German Navy exercising in front of one of the gyms of Germany's naval officers school, the Marineschule Mürwik\nResponsibility for educational oversight in Germany lies primarily with the individual federated states. Since the 1960s, a reform movement has attempted to unify secondary education into a *Gesamtschule* (comprehensive school); several West German states later simplified their school systems to two or three tiers. A system of apprenticeship called *Duale Ausbildung* (\"dual education\") allows pupils in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.[91]\n\n\nOptional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years, depending on the state. Primary education usually lasts for four years and public schools are not stratified at this stage.[91] In contrast, secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different levels of academic ability: the *Gymnasium* enrols the most academically promising children and prepares students for university studies; the *Realschule* for intermediate students lasts six years; the *Hauptschule* prepares pupils for vocational education.[92]\n\n\nIn addition Germany has a comprehensive school known as the *Gesamtschule*. While some German schools such as the Gymnasium and the Realschule have rather strict entrance requirements, the Gesamtschule does not have such requirements. They offer college preparatory classes for the students who are doing well, general education classes for average students, and remedial courses for those who aren't doing that well. In most cases students attending a Gesamtschule may graduate with the Hauptschulabschluss, the Realschulabschluss or the Abitur depending on how well they did in school.\nThe percentage of students attending a Gesamtschule varies by Bundesland. In 2007 the State of Brandenburg more than 50% of all students attended a Gesamtschule,[93] while in the State of Bavaria less than 1% did.\n\n\nThe general entrance requirement for university is Abitur, a qualification normally based on continuous assessment during the last few years at school and final examinations; however there are a number of exceptions, and precise requirements vary, depending on the state, the university and the subject. Germany's universities are recognised internationally; in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) for 2008, six of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 18 of the top 200.[94] Nearly all German universities are public institutions, tuition fees in the range of €500 were introduced in some states after 2006, but quickly abolished again until 2014.\n\n\n*Percentage of jobholders holding Hauptschulabschluss, Realschulabschluss or Abitur in Germany[95]*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **1970** | **1982** | **1991** | **2000** |\n| **Hauptschulabschluss** | 87,7%\n | 79,3%\n | 66,5%\n | 54,9%\n |\n| **Realschulabschluss** | 10,9%\n | 17,7%\n | 27%\n | 34,1%\n |\n| **Abitur** | 1,4%\n | 3%\n | 6,5%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\nOver 99% of those of age 15 and above are estimated to be able to read and write. However, a growing number of inhabitants are functionally illiterate. The young are much more likely to be functionally illiterate than the old. According to a study done by the University of Bremen in cooperation with the \"Bundesverband Alphabetisierung e.V.\", 10% of youngsters living in Germany are functionally illiterate and one quarter are able to understand only basic level texts.[96] Illiteracy rates of youngsters vary by ethnic group and parents' socioeconomic class.\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Germany\n\nThe life expectancy in Germany is 81.1 years (78.7 years males, 83.6 years females, 2020 est.).[97] \nAs of 2009[update], the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 42%, followed by malignant tumours, at 25%.[98]\nAs of 2008[update], about 82,000 Germans had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 26,000 had died from the disease (cumulatively, since 1982).[99]\nAccording to a 2005 survey, 27% of German adults are smokers.[99]\nA 2009 study shows Germany is near the median in terms of overweight and obese people in Europe.[100]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Germany\n\n![](image)2020 map of Christian denominations in the states of Germany Roman Catholic majority\n Christian majority, Catholic plurality\n Christian majority, EKD plurality\n Christians less than 50% of population, majority of Christians belong to EKD\n\nThe national constitutions of 1919 and 1949 guarantee freedom of faith and religion; earlier, these freedoms were mentioned only in state constitutions. The modern constitution of 1949 also states that no one may be discriminated against due to their faith or religious opinions. A state church does not exist in Germany (see Freedom of religion in Germany).[101]\n\n\nAccording to a 1990s poll by *Der Spiegel*, 45% of Germans believe in God, and a quarter in Jesus Christ.[102] According to the Eurobarometer Poll 2010, 44% of German citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", 25% responded that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\" and 27% responded that \"they don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force\". 4% gave no response.[103]\n\n\nChristianity is the largest religion in Germany, comprising an estimated 53.9% of the country's population.[104][105]\n\n\nSmaller religious groups (less than 1%) include Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism.[106][104]\n\n\nThe two largest churches, the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD), have lost significant number of adherents. In 2020 the Catholic Church accounted for 26.7%[104][105][107] and the Evangelical Church for 24.3%[104][105][108] of the population. Orthodox Church has 1.9% and other Christian churches and groups summed up to 1.1% of the population.[104][106] Since the reunification of Germany, the number of non-religious people has grown and an estimated 40.7% of the country's population are not affiliated with any church or religion.[104][105][106]\n\n\nThe other religions make up to less than 1% of the population.[106] Buddhism has around 200,000 adherents (0.2%), Judaism has around 200,000 adherents (0.2%), Hinduism 90,000 (0.1%), Sikhism 75,000 (0.1%) and Yazidis religion (45,000–60,000).[109] All other religious communities in Germany have fewer than 50,000 (<0.1%) adherents.\n\n\n\n| Religion in Germany (2020)[104][105] |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| No Religion |  | 40.7% |\n| Roman Catholicism |  | 26.7% |\n| Protestant Church |  | 24.3% |\n| Islam |  | 3.5% |\n| Orthodox Church |  | 1.9% |\n| Other Christians |  | 1.1% |\n| Other Religions |  | 0.9% |\n\nProtestantism is concentrated in the north and east and Roman Catholicism is concentrated in the south and west. According to the last nationwide census, Protestantism is more widespread among the population with German citizenship; there are slightly more Catholics total because of the Catholic immigrant population (including such groups as Poles and Italians).[110] The former Pope, Benedict XVI, was born in Bavaria. Non-religious people, including atheists and agnostics, might make up as many as 55% of the total population, and are especially numerous in the former East Germany and major metropolitan areas.[111]\n\n\nOf the roughly 4 million Muslims, most are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites and other denominations.[112][113] 1.9% of the country's overall population declare themselves Orthodox Christians,[104] with Serbs, Greeks, Romanians, Ukrainians and Russians being the most numerous.[114] Germany has Europe's third-largest Jewish population (after France and the United Kingdom).[115] In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total Jewish population to more than 200,000, compared to 30,000 prior to German reunification. Large cities with significant Jewish populations include Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich.[116] Around 250,000 active Buddhists live in Germany; 50% of them are Asian immigrants.[117]\n\n\n\n### 2011 Census[edit]\n\n\n**Religion (2011 German Census)**\n\n\n\nCatholic Church (30.8%)\nEKD (30.3%)\nOther, atheist or unspecified[118] (38.9%)\n\nCensus results were as follows:\n\n\n\n* Roman Catholic Church: 24,740,380 or 30.8% of the German population;\n* Protestant Church: 24,328,100 or 30.3% of the German population;\n* Other, atheist or not specified (including Protestants outside EKD): 31,151,210 or 38.9% of the German population.[110]\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Germany\n\nGerman is the only official and most widely spoken language. Standard German is understood throughout the country.\n\n\nIn 2021, the Federal Statistical Office of Germany included a new question regarding the language spoken at home in the micro-census, a large sample survey that yearly covers approximately 1% of the German population living in private households, and the results were as follows:[119]\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguages spoken at home, 2022 micro census\n| Language\n | Absolute number\n | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total population\n | 83,103,000\n | 100.00\n |\n| Only German\n | 65,440,000\n | 78.75\n |\n| Mostly German\n | 4,125,000\n | 4.96\n |\n| Mostly another language\n | 13,538,000\n | 16.29\n |\n| Of which\n | Albanian | 509,000\n | 0.61\n |\n|  | Arabic | 1,348,000\n | 1.62\n |\n| Bosnian | 237,000\n | 0.29\n |\n| Bulgarian | 218,000\n | 0.26\n |\n| Chinese | 145,000\n | 0.17\n |\n| Danish | 15,000\n | 0.02\n |\n| English | 861,000\n | 1.04\n |\n| French | 190,000\n | 0.23\n |\n| Greek | 286,000\n | 0.34\n |\n| Italian | 496,000\n | 0.60\n |\n| Croatian | 384,000\n | 0.46\n |\n| Kurdish | 511,000\n | 0.61\n |\n| Macedonian | 87,000\n | 0.10\n |\n| Dutch | 97,000\n | 0.12\n |\n| Pahto | 36,000\n | 0.04\n |\n| Persian | 391,000\n | 0.47\n |\n| Polish | 937,000\n | 1.13\n |\n| Portuguese | 167,000\n | 0.20\n |\n| Romanian | 670,000\n | 0.81\n |\n| Russian | 1,639,000\n | 1.97\n |\n| Serbian | 252,000\n | 0.30\n |\n| Spanish | 284,000\n | 0.34\n |\n| Turkish | 1,879,000\n | 2.26\n |\n| Hungarian | 203,000\n | 0.24\n |\n| Ukrainian | 191,000\n | 0.23\n |\n| Vietnamese | 138,000\n | 0.17\n |\n| Another European\nlanguage\n | 277,000\n | 0.33\n |\n| Another African\nlanguage\n | 243,000\n | 0.29\n |\n| Another Asian\nlanguage\n | 514,000\n | 0.62\n |\n|  | Another language\n | 333,000\n | 0.4\n |\n\n\n### Minority languages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bilingual German-Sorbian city limit signs\nDanish, Low German, Low Rhenish, the Sorbian languages (Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian), and the two Frisian languages, Saterfrisian and North Frisian, are officially recognized and protected as minority languages by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in their respective regions. With speakers of Romany living in all parts of Germany, the federal government has promised to take action to protect the language. Until now, only Hesse has followed Berlin's announcement, and agreed on implementing concrete measures to support Romany speakers.\n\n\nGermany is a strong supporter of the Charter, as evidenced by things like the 2022 report from the Secretary General of the Council of Europe specifically naming Germany as an example of how to incorporate minority languages in State media.[120][121] Still, Germany—like many other signatories of the Charter—has room for improvement in its implementation of the Charter.[122]\n\n\n\n\n\nProtected Minority Languages in Germany\n| Language | States\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Danish | Schleswig-Holstein |\n| North Frisian | Schleswig-Holstein |\n| Saterland Frisian | Lower Saxony |\n| Low German | Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein, North Rhine-Westphalia |\n| Low Rhenish | North Rhine-Westphalia |\n| Upper Sorbian | Saxony |\n| Lower Sorbian | Brandenburg |\n| Romany | Hesse *de facto*, *de jure* in all states (see text)\n |\n\n\n### High German dialects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)City limits sign; this city is called *Emlichheim* in High German and *Emmelkamp* in Low German.\nGerman dialects – some quite distinct from the standard language – are used in everyday speech, especially in rural regions. Many dialects, for example the Upper German varieties, are to some degree cultivated as symbols of regional identity and have their own literature, theaters and some TV programming. While speaking a dialect outside its native region might be frowned upon, in their native regions some dialects can be spoken by all social classes.[*citation needed*] Nevertheless, partly due to the prevalence of Standard German in media, the use of dialects has declined over the past century, especially in the younger population.\n\n\nThe social status of different German dialects can vary greatly. The Alemannic and Bavarian dialects of the south are positively valued by their speakers and can be used in almost all social circumstances. The Saxonian and Thuringian dialects have less prestige and are subject to derision. While Bavarian and Alemannic have kept much of their distinctiveness, the Middle German dialects, which are closer to Standard German, have lost some of their distinctive lexical and grammatical features and tend to be only pronunciation variants of Standard German.\n\n\n\n### Low Saxon dialects[edit]\n\n\nLow Saxon is officially recognized as a language on its own, but despite this fact, there's little official action taken on fostering the language. Historically one third of Germany's territory and population was Low Saxon speaking. No data was ever collected on the actual number of speakers, but today the number of speakers ranges around 5 million persons. Despite this relatively high number of speakers there is very little coverage in the media (mostly on NDR TV, no regular programming) and very little education in or on the language. The language is not fixed as part of the school curriculum and Low Saxon is used as a medium of instruction in one school only in the whole Germany (as a \"model project\" in primary school sided by education in Standard German). As a consequence the younger generation refused to adopt the native language of their parents. Language prevalence dropped from more than 90% (depending on the exact region) in the 1930s to less than 5% today. This accounts for a massive intergenerational gap in language use. Older people regularly use the language and take private initiative to maintain the language, but the lack of innovative potential of the younger generation hinders language maintenance. The language too has an own literature (around 150 published books every year) and there are many theatres (mostly lay stages, but some professional ones, like for example Ohnsorg-Theater).\n\n\nUse of Low Saxon is mainly restricted to use among acquaintances, like family members, neighbours and friends. A meeting of a village council can be held almost completely in Low Saxon if all participants know each other (as long as written protocols are written in Standard German), but a single foreigner can make the whole switching to Standard German.\n\n\nThe Low Saxon dialects are different in their status too. There's a north–south gradient in language maintenance. The Southern dialects of Westfalian, Eastfalian and Brandenburgish have had much stronger speaker losses, than the northern coastal dialects of Northern Low Saxon. While Eastfalian has lost speakers to Standard German, Westfalian has lost speakers to Standard German and Standard German based regiolect of the Rhine-Ruhr area. Brandenburgish speakers mostly switched to the Standard German-based regiolect of Berlin. Brandenburgish is almost completely replaced by the Berlin regiolect. Northern Low Saxon speakers switched mostly to pure Standard German.\n\n\n\n### Foreign languages[edit]\n\n\nEnglish is the most common foreign language and almost universally taught by the secondary level; it is also taught at elementary level in some states. Other commonly-taught languages are French, Italian, Spanish and Russian. Dutch is taught in states bordering the Netherlands, and Polish in the eastern states bordering Poland.[123]Latin and Ancient Greek are part of the classical education syllabus offered in many secondary schools.\n\n\nAccording to a 2004 survey, two-thirds of Germany's citizens have at least basic knowledge of English.[*citation needed*] About 20% consider themselves to be competent speakers of French, followed by speakers of Russian (7%), Italian (6.1%), and Spanish (5.6%). The relatively high number of Russian speakers is a result of immigration from the former Soviet Union to Germany for almost 10 consecutive years, plus its having been learned in school by many older former East Germans as compulsory first foreign language.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Germany portal\n* ![flag](image)European Union portal\n\n\n* Germans\n* Census in Germany\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In fertility rates, 2.1 and above is a stable population and have been marked blue, 2 and below leads to an aging population and a reducing population.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Bevölkerungsstand\".

According to the most recent data, Germany's population is 84,432,670 (31 March 2023)[1] making it the most populous country in the European Union and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.58 in 2021,[6] significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1. For a long time Germany had one of the world's lowest fertility rates of around 1.3 to 1.4, however there has been a small increase in recent years.[7] Due to the low birth rate Germany has recorded more deaths than births every year since 1972,[8] which means 2021 was the 50th consecutive year the German population would have decreased without immigration. However, due to immigration the population has actually increased during the last half-century. In 2019 the number of people with a foreign background was 26%;[9] this category includes foreigners, naturalized citizens, ethnic German repatriates from Eastern Europe and the children of all of the above.\n\n\nUntil the early 20th century Germany was also a large emigrant nation; in the 19th century more than 5 million citizens of the German Empire emigrated to the US alone, and in the early 20th century Germany lost another two million to the US as well as significant numbers to Latin America, Canada and Eastern Europe. However, after World War II immigration began to outweigh emigration, as around 14 million ethnic Germans were expelled from the former eastern provinces of the Reich and other areas in Eastern Europe. Of these, roughly 12 million made their way to present-day Germany and several hundred thousand settled in Austria and other countries, while several hundred thousand died. Some additional 4.5 million ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe repatriated after 1950, especially around the end of the Eastern Bloc and mostly from the former Soviet Union, Poland and Romania.[10][11]\n\n\nLarge-scale immigration to West Germany began during the time of the Wirtschaftswunder from the 1950s to early 1970s when Germany had a shortage of workers and let in Southern Europeans from countries like Turkey, Italy and Spain on a temporary basis as guest workers. The liberalisation of guest worker legislation allowed many to stay and build a life in West Germany. Germany saw another large wave of immigration towards the end of the 20th century, driven by German reunification, refugee inflows from the Yugoslav Wars and large numbers of Turkish nationals seeking asylum. The next large immigration wave began after eastern expansion of the European Union in 2011 as Eastern Europeans were now allowed to live and work in Germany without a visa. During the European migrant crisis of the mid 2010s Germany took in a large number of refugees, both in absolute terms and relative to other EU member states; the country recorded 476,649 asylum seekers in 2015, 745,545 in 2016 and declining numbers thereafter.[12]\n\n\nGermany has one of the world's highest levels of education, technological development, and economic productivity. Since the end of World War II, the number of students entering university has more than tripled, and the trade and technical schools are among the world's best. With a per capita income of about €40,883 in 2018,[13] Germany is a broadly middle-class society. However, there has been a strong increase in the number of children living in poverty. In 1965, one in 75 children was on the welfare rolls; but by 2007 this had increased to one child in six. These children live in relative poverty, but not necessarily in absolute poverty.[14] Millions of Germans travel overseas each year. The social welfare system provides for universal health care, unemployment compensation, child benefits and other social programmes. Germany's aging population and struggling economy strained the welfare system in the 1990s, so the government adopted a wide-ranging programme of – still controversial – belt-tightening reforms, Agenda 2010, including the labour-market reforms known as Hartz concept.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1945–1990[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population evolution of Germany, since 1950\nAfter the World War II border shifts and expulsions, the Germans from Central and Eastern Europe and the former eastern territories moved westward to post-war Germany. During the partition of Germany, many Germans from East Germany fled to West Germany for political and economic reasons. Since Germany's reunification, there are ongoing migrations from the eastern *New Länder* to the western *Old Länder* for economic reasons.\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic followed different paths when it came to demographics. The politics of the German Democratic Republic was pronatalistic[15] while that of the Federal Republic was compensatory.\n\n\nFertility in the GDR was higher than that in the FRG. Demographic politics was only one of the reasons. Women in the GDR had fewer \"biographic options\", young motherhood was expected of them. State funded costfree childcare was available to all mothers.[16]\n\n\n\nMother's mean age at first birth in East and West Germany\n\nNote: Berlin is included into East Germany for the year 2002 and 2008.

This has been attributed to a \"demographic shock\": people not only had fewer children, they were also less likely to marry or divorce after the end of the GDR; the biographic options of the citizens of the former GDR had increased. Young motherhood seemed to be less attractive and the age of the first birth rose sharply.[16]\n\n\nIn the following years, the TFR in the East started to rise again, surpassing 1.0 in 1997 and 1.3 in 2004, and reaching the West's TFR (1.37) in 2007. In 2010, the East's fertility rate (1.459) clearly exceeded that of the West (1.385), while Germany's overall TFR had risen to 1.393, the highest value since 1990,[20][21] which was still far below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 and the birth rates seen under communism. In 2016, the TFR was 1.64 in the East and 1.60 in the West.[22]\n\n\nBetween 1989 and 2009, about 2,000 schools closed because there were fewer children.[18]\n\n\nIn some regions the number of women between the ages of 20 and 30 has dropped by more than 30%.[18] In 2004, in the age group 18–29 (statistically important for starting families) there were only 90 women for every 100 men in the new federal states (the East, including Berlin).\n\n\nUntil 2007 family politics in the federal republic was compensatory, which means that poor families received more family benefits (such as the *Erziehungsgeld*) than rich ones. In 2007 the so-called *Elterngeld* was introduced. According to Christoph Butterwegge the Elterngeld was meant to \"motivate highly educated women to have more children\"; the poor on the other hand were disadvantaged by the *Elterngeld*, and now received lower child benefits than the middle classes.[23] The very well-off (who earn more than 250.000 Euro per annum) and those on welfare receive no Elterngeld payments.[24]\n\n\nIn 2013 the following most recent developments were noticed:[25]\n\n\n\n* The income of families with young children has risen. Persons holding a college degree, persons older than 30 years and parents with only one child benefited the most. Single parents and young parents did not benefit.\n* Fathers are becoming more involved in parenting, and 28% of them now take some time off work (3.3 months on average) when their children are born.\n* Mothers are more likely to work and as a result less likely to be economically deprived than they used to be.\n* The birth rate of college-educated women has risen.\n\n\nIn the new federal states the fertility rate of college-educated women is now higher than that of those without college degrees. Differences in value priorities and the better availability of childcare in the eastern states are discussed as possible reasons.[26]\n\n\nIn 2019, the non-profit Austrian Institute of Economic Research and the Bertelsmann Stiftung published a study about the economic impact of demographics. The researchers assume a reduction in the per capita income of €3,700 until 2040.[27]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Census in Germany\n\n![](image)Historical population of Germany\nThe contemporary demographics of Germany used to also be measured by a series of full censuses mandated by the state, with the most recent held in 1987. Since reunification, German authorities rely on a *micro census*.\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review.[28] Due to the privacy concerns of the German population after reunification, Germany did not hold a regular census until the EU-mandated 2011 German Census. The requirement was met with large disapproval. As required by the EU, Germany now continues to hold censuses every 10 years.[29]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 43 seconds\n* One death every 34 seconds\n* Net gain of one person every 4 minutes\n* One net migrant every 2 minutes\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Out of 778,080 births in 2019, 258,835 were to unmarried parents,[47] which means that around 33% or one third of the children are born out of wedlock, while two thirds are within. This percentage of unmarried birth has long been growing and reached 33% in 2010, more than twice of what it was in 1990.[48] However in recent years it has started to stagnate or even decrease.[49]\n\n\nThe Mikrozensus done in 2008 revealed that the number of children a German woman aged 40 to 75 had, was closely linked to her educational achievement.[50]\nIn Western Germany the most educated women were the most likely to be childless. 26% of those groups stated they were childless, while 16% of those having an intermediate education, and 11% of those having compulsory education, stated the same.\nIn Eastern Germany however, 9% of the most educated women of that age group and 7% of those who had an intermediary education were childless, while 12% of those having only compulsory education were childless.\n\n\nThe reason for that east-western difference is that the GDR had an \"educated mother scheme\" and actively tried to encourage first births among the more educated. It did so by propagandizing the opinion that every educated woman should \"present at least one child to socialism\" and also by financially rewarding its more educated citizen to become parents. The government especially tried to persuade students to become parents while still in college and it was quite successful in doing so. In 1986 38% of all women, who were about to graduate from college, were mothers of at least one child and additional 14% were pregnant and 43% of all men, who were about to graduate from college, were fathers of at least one child. There was a sharp decline in the birth rate and especially in the birth rate of the educated after the fall of the Berlin wall. Nowadays,[*when?*] 5% of those about to graduate from college are parents.\n\n\nThe more educated a Western German mother aged 40 to 75 was in 2008, the less likely she was to have a big family.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Percent of Western German mothers having 1, 2 and 3 or more children by educational attainment\n |\n| --- |\n| number of children\n | compulsory education\n | intermediary education\n | highest education\n |\n| one child | 22 | 30 | 31\n |\n| two children | 39 | 48 | 48\n |\n| three or more children | 39 | 22 | 21\n |\n| [51] |\n\n\nThe same was true for a mother living in Eastern Germany in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Percent of Eastern German mothers having 1, 2 and 3 and more children by educational attainment\n |\n| --- |\n| number of children\n | compulsory education\n | intermediary education\n | highest education\n |\n| one child | 23 | 33 | 33\n |\n| two children | 37 | 46 | 51\n |\n| three or more children | 40 | 21 | 16\n |\n| [51] |\n\n\nIn 2011, this trend was reversed in Eastern Germany, where more highly educated women now had a somewhat higher fertility rate than the rest of the population.[52]\n\n\nPersons who said they had no religion tend to have fewer children than those who identify as Christians, and studies also found that conservative-leaning Christians had more children compared to liberal-leaning Christians.[53][54]\n\n\nA study done in 2005 in the western German state of Nordrhein-Westfalen by the HDZ revealed that childlessness was especially widespread among scientists. It showed that 78% of the women scientists and 71% of the male scientists working in that state were childless.[55]\n\n\n\n### Homelessness[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Homelessness in Germany.[edit]\nHomelessness in Germany is a significant social issue, one that is estimated to affect around 678,000 people.[56] This figure includes about 372,000 people that are accommodated (in refugee shelters, etc.) by public services, e.g. by the municipalities.[57] Since 2014, there has been a 150% increase in the homeless population within the country.[58] Reportedly, around 22,000 of the homeless population are children.[56][*citation needed*]\n\n\n\nIn addition, the country has yet to publish statistics on homelessness at a Federal Level[59] despite it being an ongoing and widespread matter.\n\n## Ethnic minorities and migrant background (*Migrationshintergrund*)[edit]\n\n\nGermany does not collect data on the ethnic and racial identifications of its citizens, but does collect data on the background group by birth of an individual.[60] The Federal Statistical Office defines persons with a migrant background as all persons who migrated to the present area of the Federal Republic of Germany after 1949, plus all foreign nationals born in Germany and all persons born in Germany as German nationals with at least one parent who migrated to Germany or was born in Germany as a foreign national. The figures presented here are based on this definition only.\n\n\nIn 2010, 2.3 million families with children under 18 years were living in Germany, in which at least one parent had foreign roots. They represented 29% of the total of 8.1 million families with minor children. Compared with 2005 – the year when the microcensus started to collect detailed information on the population with a migrant background – the proportion of migrant families has risen by 2 percentage points.[61] In 2019, 40% children under 5 years old had migrant background.[62]\n\n\nMost of the families with a migrant background live in the western part of Germany. In 2010, the proportion of migrant families in all families was 32% in the former territory of the Federal Republic. This figure was more than double that in the new Länder (incl. Berlin) where it stood at 15%.[61] Eastern Germany has a much lower proportion of immigrants than the West, as the GDR did not let in that many guest workers and Eastern Germany's economy is not doing as well as West Germany's and had a higher percentage of jobless persons until recently. However in recent years the number of people with an immigrant background in East Germany has been growing as refugees (as well as German Repatriates) are distributed with the Königssteiner Schlüssel, so every German state has to take the same number of them compared to its population and economy. In 2019 19.036 million people or 89,6% of people with an immigrant background live in Western Germany (excluding Berlin), being 28,7% of its population, while 1.016 million people with immigrant background 4,8% live in Eastern States, being 8,2% of population, and 1.194 million people with an immigrant background 5,6% live in Berlin, being 33,1% of its population.[62]\n\n\nIn 2019, 26% of Germans of any age group (up from 18,4% in 2008) and 39% of German children (up from 30% in 2008) had at least one parent born abroad. Average age for Germans with at least one parent born abroad was 35.6 years (up from 33.8 years in 2008), while that for Germans, who had two parents born in Germany was 47.3 years (up from 44.6 in 2008).[62][63]\n\n\nIn 2022, 41 percent of the under-15 age group had a migrant background, 36 percent of the 15 to 49-year-old age group had a migrant background and 19 percent of the age group above (50+).[64]\n\n\nThe largest groups of people with an immigrant background in Germany are people that have Turkey, Poland and Russia as their ancestral homelands.\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the

they have lived in their respective regions for centuries: Danes, Frisians, Roma and Sinti, and Sorbs. There is a Danish minority (about 50,000, according to government sources) in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein. Eastern and Northern Frisians live at Schleswig-Holstein's western coast, and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony. They are part of a wider community (Frisia) stretching from Germany to the northern Netherlands. The Sorbs, a Slavic people with about 60,000 members (according to government sources), are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg. They are the last remnants of the Slavs that lived in central and eastern Germany since the 7th century to have kept their traditions and not been completely integrated into the wider German nation.\n\n\nUntil World War II the Poles were recognized as one of the national minorities. In 1924 the Union of Poles in Germany had initiated cooperation between all national minorities in Germany under the umbrella organization Association of National Minorities in Germany. Some of the union members wanted the Polish communities in easternmost Germany (now Poland) to join the newly established Polish nation after World War I.[70] Even before the German invasion of Poland, leading anti-Nazi members of the Polish minority were deported to concentration camps; some were executed at the Piaśnica murder site. Minority rights for Poles in Germany were revoked by Hermann Göring's World War II decree of 27 February 1940, and their property was confiscated.\n\n\nAfter the war ended, the German government did not re-implement national minority rights for ethnic Poles. The reason for this is that the areas of Germany which formerly had a native Polish minority were annexed to Poland and the Soviet Union, while almost all of the native German populations (formerly the ethnic majority) in these areas subsequently fled or were expelled by force. With the mixed German-Polish territories now lost, the German government subsequently regarded ethnic Poles residing in what remained of Germany as immigrants, just like any other ethnic population with a recent history of arrival. In contrast, Germans living in Poland are recognized as national minority and have granted seats in Polish Parliament. It must be said, however, that an overwhelming number of Germans in Poland have centuries-old historical ties to the lands they now inhabit, whether from living in territory that once belonged to the German state, or from centuries-old communities. In contrast, most Poles in present-day Germany are recent immigrants, though there are some communities which have been present since the 19th and perhaps even the 18th centuries. Despite protests by some in the older Polish-German communities, and despite Germany being now a signatory to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Germany has so far refused to re-implement minority rights for ethnic Poles, based on the fact that almost all areas of historically mixed German-Polish heritage (where the minority rights formerly existed) are no longer part of Germany and because the vast majority of ethnic Poles now residing in Germany are recent immigrants.\n\n\nRoma people have been in Germany since the Middle Ages. They were persecuted by the Nazis, and thousands of Roma living in Germany were killed by the Nazi regime. Nowadays, they are spread all over Germany, mostly living in major cities. It is difficult to estimate their exact number, as the German government counts them as \"persons without migrant background\" in their statistics. There are also many assimilated Sinti and Roma. A vague figure given by the German Department of the Interior is about 70,000. In contrast to the old-established Roma population, the majority of them do not have German citizenship, and are classified as immigrants or refugees.\n\n\n\n![](image)A family of so-called \"Spätaussiedler\" (repatriates of ethnic German origin), because the parents were born abroad they will be counted as \"persons with immigrant background\"\nAfter World War II, 14 million ethnic Germans were expelled from the eastern territories of Germany and homelands outside the former German Empire. The accommodation and integration of these *Heimatvertriebene* in the remaining part of Germany, in which many cities and millions of apartments had been destroyed, was a major effort in the post-war occupation zones and later states of Germany.\n\n\nSince the 1960s, ethnic Germans from the People's Republic of Poland and Soviet Union (especially from Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine), have come to Germany. During the time of Perestroika, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the number of immigrants increased heavily. Some of these immigrants are of mixed ancestry. During the 10-year period between 1987 and 2001, a total of 1,981,732 ethnic Germans from the FSU immigrated to Germany, along with more than a million of their non-German relatives. After 1997, however ethnic Slavs or those belonging to Slavic-Germanic mixed origins outnumbered those with only Germanic descent amongst the immigrants. The total number of people currently living in Germany having FSU connection is around 4 to 4.5 million (Including Germans, Slavs, Jews, and those of mixed origins), out of that more than 50% are of German descent.[71][72]\n\n\nGermany now has Europe's third-largest Jewish population. In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total inflow to more than 100,000 since 1991.[73] Jews have a voice in German public life through the Central Council of Jews in Germany (Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland). Some Jews from the former Soviet Union are of mixed heritage. Today, less than 0.1% of the total population of Germany is Jewish.\n\n\n  \n\nIn 2019 there were also a growing number of at least 529,000 black Afro-Germans defined as people with an African migrant background.[62] Out of them more than 400 thousand have a citizenship of a Subsahara-African country,[74] with others being German citizens. Most of them live in Berlin and Hamburg. Numerous persons from northern African Tunisia and Morocco live in Germany. While they are considered members of a minority group, for the most part, they do not considers themselves \"Afro-Germans,\" nor are most of them perceived as such by the German people. However, Germany does not keep any statistics regarding ethnicity or race. Hence, the exact number of Germans of African descent is unknown.\n\n\nGermany's biggest East Asian minorities are the Chinese people in Germany, numbering 189,000[62]\nand Vietnamese people in Germany, numbering 188,000,[62] many of whom living in Berlin and eastern Germany.\nAlso there are about 35,000 Japanese citizens residing in Germany.[75] There are also groups of South Asian and Southeast Asian immigrants. Around 163,000 Indians and 124,000 Pakistanis live in Germany.[62] Additionally some 30,000 Filipino citizens and more than 20,000 Indonesian citizens reside in Germany.[75]\n\n\nNumerous descendants of the so-called *Gastarbeiter* live in Germany. The *Gastarbeiter* mostly came from Turkey, Italy, Greece, Spain, Morocco, Portugal, the former Yugoslavia, Tunisia and Chile.\nAlso included were Vietnam, Mongolia, North Korea, Angola, Mozambique and Cuba when the former East Germany existed until reunification in 1990.[76] The (socialist) German Democratic Republic (East Germany) however had their guest-workers stay in single-sex dormitories.[77] Female guest workers had to sign contracts saying that they were not allowed to fall pregnant during their stay. If they fell pregnant nevertheless they faced forced abortion or deportation.[78] This is one of the reasons why the vast majority of ethnic minorities today lives in western Germany and also one of the reasons why minorities such as the Vietnamese have the most unusual population pyramid, with nearly all second-generation Vietnamese Germans born after 1989.\n\n\n\n![](image)Proportion of Germans without a migrant background (2016)\n![](image)Germany is home to the second-largest number of international migrants worldwide.[79][80] In 2016, around 23% of Germany's population do not hold a German passport or are descendants of immigrants.[81]\n## Foreign nationals in Germany[edit]\n\n\n![](image)German and foreign national population pyramid of Germany in 2021\nAs the end of 2022, the most common groups of resident foreign nationals in Germany were as follows:[82]\n\n\nThis list does not include non-ethnic Germans with German nationality and foreign nationals without resident status.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Nationality\n | Population (31.12.2022)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Total | 13,383,910\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Turkey | 1,487,110\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Ukraine | 1,164,200\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Syria | 923,805\n |\n| 4 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Romania | 883,670\n |\n| 5 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Poland | 880,780\n |\n| 6 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Italy | 644,970\n |\n| 7 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Croatia | 436,325\n |\n| 8 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Bulgaria | 429,665\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Afghanistan | 377,240\n |\n| 10 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Greece | 361,270\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) Russia | 290,615\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) Iraq | 284,595\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Kosovo | 280,850\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Serbia | 251,365\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina | 233,775\n |\n| 16 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Hungary | 214,695\n |\n| 17 | ![](image) India | 210,385\n |\n| 18 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Spain | 193,460\n |\n| 19 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Austria | 185,755\n |\n| 20 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Netherlands | 150,295\n |\n| 21 | ![](image) China | 149,550\n |\n| 22 | ![](image) North Macedonia | 146,380\n |\n| 23 | ![](image) Iran | 143,555\n |\n| 24 | ![European Union](image)![](image) France | 140,320\n |\n| 25 | ![European Union](image)![](image) Portugal | 139,435\n |\n| 26 | ![](image) United States | 121,420\n |\n| 27 | ![](image) Vietnam | 120,535\n |\n| 28 | ![](image) Albania | 108,555\n |\n| 29 | ![](image) Morocco | 95,095\n |\n| 30 | ![](image) United Kingdom | 84,605\n |\n\n\n## Population density and distribution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population density by municipality\nWith an estimated 83.2 million inhabitants in December 2020,[83] Germany is the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia, and ranks as the 19th largest country in the world in terms of population. Its population density stands at 233 inhabitants per square kilometer.\n\n\n\n### States[edit]\n\n\nGermany comprises sixteen states that are collectively referred to as *Länder*.[84] Due to differences in size and population the subdivision of these states varies, especially between city-states (*Stadtstaaten*) and states with larger territories (*Flächenländer*). For regional administrative purposes four states, namely Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia, consist of a total of 19 Government Districts (*Regierungsbezirke*). As of 2019 Germany is divided into 400 districts (*Kreise*) on municipal level, these consist of 294 rural districts and 106 urban districts.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![Lower Saxony](image) Lower Saxony\n\n![Free Hanseatic City of Bremen](image) Bremen\n\n![Hamburg](image) Hamburg\n\n![Mecklenburg-Vorpommern](image) Mecklenburg-  \nVorpommern\n\n![Saxony-Anhalt](image) Saxony-  \nAnhalt\n\n![Saxony](image) Saxony\n\n![Brandenburg](image) Brandenburg\n\n![Berlin](image) Berlin\n\n![Thuringia](image) Thuringia\n\n![Hesse](image) Hesse\n\n![North Rhine-Westphalia](image) North Rhine-  \nWestphalia\n\n![Rhineland-Palatinate](image) Rhineland-Palatinate\n\n![Bavaria](image) Bavaria\n\n![Baden-Württemberg](image) Baden-  \nWürttemberg\n\n![Saarland](image) Saarland\n\n![Schleswig-Holstein](image) Schleswig-Holstein\n\n![](image)Germany states by foreigners as percentage of population as of November 2020\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| State | Capital | Area(km2) | Population[85](31 December 2022)\n | Foreigners\n | Population density(per km2)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Rhine-Westphalia | Düsseldorf | 34,112 | 18,139,116 ![Increase](image) | 2,828,367 ![Increase](image) | 532\n |\n| Bavaria | Munich | 70,541 | 13,369,116 ![Increase](image) | 2,073,494 ![Increase](image) | 190\n |\n| Baden-Württemberg | Stuttgart | 35,748 | 11,280,257 ![Increase](image) | 2,012,237 ![Increase](image) | 316\n |\n| Lower Saxony | Hanover | 47,709 | 8,140,242 ![Increase](image) | 959,786 ![Increase](image) | 171\n |\n| Hesse | Wiesbaden | 21,116 | 6,391,360 ![Increase](image) | 1,199,775 ![Increase](image) | 303\n |\n| Rhineland-Palatinate | Mainz | 19,858 | 4,159,150 ![Increase](image) | 566,026 ![Increase](image) | 209\n |\n| Saxony | Dresden | 18,450 | 4,086,152 ![Increase](image) | 300,164 ![Increase](image) | 221\n |\n| Berlin | Berlin | 891 | 3,755,251 ![Increase](image) | 834,349 ![Increase](image) | 4,215\n |\n| Schleswig-Holstein | Kiel | 15,804 | 2,953,270 ![Increase](image) | 299,787 ![Increase](image) | 187\n |\n| Brandenburg | Potsdam | 29,654 | 2,573,135 ![Increase](image) | 179,872 ![Increase](image) | 87\n |\n| Saxony-Anhalt | Magdeburg | 20,454 | 2,186,643 ![Increase](image) | 160,990 ![Increase](image) | 107\n |\n| Thuringia | Erfurt | 16,202 | 2,126,846 ![Increase](image) | 161,291 ![Increase](image) | 131\n |\n| Hamburg | Hamburg | 755 | 1,892,122 ![Increase](image) | 363,283 ![Increase](image) | 2,506\n |\n| Mecklenburg-Vorpommern | Schwerin | 23,295 | 1,628,378 ![Increase](image) | 105,437 ![Increase](image) | 70\n |\n| Saarland | Saarbrücken | 2,571 | 992,666 ![Increase](image) | 139,189 ![Increase](image) | 386\n |\n| Bremen | Bremen | 419 | 684,864 ![Increase](image) | 144,148 ![Increase](image) | 1,634\n |\n| Germany | Berlin | 357,582 | 84,358,845 ![Increase](image) | 12,324,195 ![Increase](image) | 236\n |\n\n |\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of cities in Germany; List of cities in Germany with more than 100,000 inhabitants; and Metropolitan regions in Germany\n\nGermany officially has eleven metropolitan regions. In 2005, Germany had 82 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Metropolitan region | Location | Description | Population | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rhine-Ruhr | ![](image) | The metropolitan area is part of the pan-European Blue Banana mega region and is a significant industrial and commercial hub, home to many of Germany's biggest corporations and contributing as much as 15% to the German GDP. Included in the rather polycentric conurbation are the cities of Cologne, Düsseldorf, Bonn, Dortmund and Essen served by two of the country's largest airports Düsseldorf Airport and the Cologne Bonn Airport. Particularly among young Germans, Cologne and Düsseldorf are known for their nightlife and open-minded atmosphere.\n | approx. 10 million\n | Turks, Poles, Italians, Romanians, Africans, Arabs, Greeks, Dutch, Russians, Serbs, Bulgarians and Spaniards |\n| Berlin/Brandenburg | ![](image) | Berlin is the capital and largest city. It lies in the eastern part of the country, completely surrounded by the rather sparsely populated state of Brandenburg. Berlin is regarded as one of Europe's most open, vibrant and ever changing capitals. The city is arguably the most diverse city in Germany regarding culture and ethnicity. Regarded as an economically weak region of Germany for a long time, it is now transforming itself into the entrepreneurial center of Europe. Dubbed the \"Silicon Allee\" by insiders of the tech industry, Berlin is home to countless startup companies and one of Germany's densest knowledge hubs with 4 public universities and countless research centers.\n | approx. 6 million\n | Turks, Russians, Poles, Africans, Italians, Americans, Vietnamese, Serbs, Arabs, Bulgarians, Romanians, French and Spaniards |\n| Munich | ![](image) | The metropolitan area in and around Munich has one of Germany's highest standard of living. Housing some of the countries largest car and machine companies, it is known for its economic strength mixed with the uniqueness of Bavarian culture, taking up almost the entirety of southern Bavaria. It is the closest metropolitan area to the Alps.\n | approx. 5.7 million\n | Turks, Albanians, Croats, Italians, Poles, Greeks, Austrians, Romanians, Arabs, Africans and Serbs |\n| Rhine-Main | ![](image) | Frankfurt is the financial and commercial center both for Germany and continental Europe. Almost all of Germany's big banks and the ECB have their HQ located inside the city of Frankfurt. Despite not having a population of over a million, it is Germany's only city with a large, visible cluster of skyscrapers. The city is one of Europe's biggest transit hubs with Europe's 6th busiest airport (Frankfurt airport), Germany's second busiest railway stations and one of the EU's most heavily used interchanges.\n | approx. 5.5 million\n | Turks, Poles, Italians, African, Croats, Romanians, Greeks, Serbs, Spaniards, Americans, Chinese, Arabs and Indians |\n| Hamburg | ![](image) | Hamburg is the country's second largest city and the biggest Hanseatic city in Europe. It is Europe's 3rd busiest container port with just under 9 million TEUs annually. The city is proud of its diverse nightlife and music scene centered in and around the famous St. Pauli district.\n | approx. 5.3 million\n | Turks, Albanians, Poles, African, Portuguese, Romanians, Russians, Italians and Spaniards |\n| Stuttgart | ![](image) | Stuttgart has a reputation for research, inventions and industry. The German headquarters of many international enterprises are in Stuttgart. This contrasts with the strong rural, down-to-earth attitude of the Stuttgarters throughout the classes. A popular slogan is \"We are good at everything. Except speaking High (standard) German.\"\n | approx. 5.2 million\n | Turks, Albanians, Greeks, Dutch, Italians, Croats, Serbs, French, Chinese, Romanians, Americans and Spaniards.[*citation needed*] |\n| Hannover–Braunschweig–Göttingen–Wolfsburg | ![](image) | The relatively urban south of Lower Saxony, located on route between the Ruhr area and Berlin, and the route form Hamburg to the south, has been important for logistics, industry, but also developed a strong standing in the service industries.\n | approx. 3.7 million\n | Turks, Kurds (especially around Celle), Serbs, Ukrainians, Greeks, Russians, Italians (especially in Wolfsburg) and Spanish (Especially in Hanover).[*citation needed*] |\n| Bremen/Oldenburg | ![](image) | Located in the northwestern part of Germany, the main axis contains the cities of Bremen, Delmenhorst and Oldenburg, with the cities of Wilhelmshaven and Bremerhaven being the northern corners at the north sea. Major rural areas are covered in between these cities. There is a smooth transition to the Hamburg metropolitan area to the east.\n | approx. 2.7 million\n | Turks, Russians, Albanians, Serbs, Portuguese, Iranians, Dutch, Americans and Britons.[*citation needed*] |\n| Central German Metropolitan Region | ![](image) | The economic region stretches across three federal states. The major city is Leipzig in Saxony, other important cities are Halle/Saale, Gera and Jena. The region is known for its universities and research, for its trade fairs and conventions, as a central distribution hub (Leipzig-Halle-Airport), as center for chemical and industrial production, for the well preserved inner cities and the developed classical and alternative cultural scene. Leipzig is one of the fastest-growing cities in Germany, with a rising economy.\n | approx. 2.4 mil\n | Russians, Poles, Vietnamese, Italians, Romanians, Ukrainians, Chinese, Turks, Portuguese, people from Syria, from Kazakhstan and from Afghanistan.[86] |\n\n\n## Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Immigration to Germany and Germans Abroad\n See also: European migrant crisis\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund lists Germany as host to the third-highest number of international migrants worldwide, behind the United States and Saudi Arabia.[80] The largest ethnic group of non-German origin are the Turkish. Since the 1960s, West and later reunified Germany has attracted immigrants primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Turkey, many of whom (or their children) have acquired German citizenship over time. While most of these immigrants initially arrived as guest workers, changes to guest worker legislation allowed many to stay and to build lives in Germany.\n\n\nGermany had signed special visa agreements with several countries in times of severe labour shortages or when particular skills were deficient within the country. During the 1960s and 1970s, agreements were signed with the governments of Turkey, Yugoslavia, Italy and Spain to help Germany overcome its severe labour shortage.\n\n\nAs of 2012, after Germany fully legalized visa-free immigrants from the eastern states of the EU, the largest sources of net immigration to Germany were other European countries, most importantly Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Spain, and Greece; notably, in the case of Turkey, German Turks moving to Turkey slightly outnumbered new immigrants in 2012,[87] however, in recent years there are more Turkish immigrants in Germany than emigrants again, including illegal Turkish migrants.\n\n\nIn 2015, there was a large increase in asylum applications following the 2015 refugee crisis, mainly due to the violent conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan: 476,649 asylum applications were counted that year.[88] This number went up to even 745,545 in 2016 and began to decline after it.[12]\n\n\nIn 2022, some 23.8 million people in Germany, or 28.7% of the population have migrant background.[89]\n\n\nFollowing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, over 1.06 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany as of April 2023.[90]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Germany\n\n![](image)Cadets of the German Navy exercising in front of one of the gyms of Germany's naval officers school, the Marineschule Mürwik\nResponsibility for educational oversight in Germany lies primarily with the individual federated states. Since the 1960s, a reform movement has attempted to unify secondary education into a *Gesamtschule* (comprehensive school); several West German states later simplified their school systems to two or three tiers. A system of apprenticeship called *Duale Ausbildung* (\"dual education\") allows pupils in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.[91]\n\n\nOptional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years, depending on the state. Primary education usually lasts for four years and public schools are not stratified at this stage.[91] In contrast, secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different levels of academic ability: the *Gymnasium* enrols the most academically promising children and prepares students for university studies; the *Realschule* for intermediate students lasts six years; the *Hauptschule* prepares pupils for vocational education.[92]\n\n\nIn addition Germany has a comprehensive school known as the *Gesamtschule*. While some German schools such as the Gymnasium and the Realschule have rather strict entrance requirements, the Gesamtschule does not have such requirements. They offer college preparatory classes for the students who are doing well, general education classes for average students, and remedial courses for those who aren't doing that well. In most cases students attending a Gesamtschule may graduate with the Hauptschulabschluss, the Realschulabschluss or the Abitur depending on how well they did in school.\nThe percentage of students attending a Gesamtschule varies by Bundesland. In 2007 the State of Brandenburg more than 50% of all students attended a Gesamtschule,[93] while in the State of Bavaria less than 1% did.\n\n\nThe general entrance requirement for university is Abitur, a qualification normally based on continuous assessment during the last few years at school and final examinations; however there are a number of exceptions, and precise requirements vary, depending on the state, the university and the subject. Germany's universities are recognised internationally; in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) for 2008, six of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 18 of the top 200.[94] Nearly all German universities are public institutions, tuition fees in the range of €500 were introduced in some states after 2006, but quickly abolished again until 2014.\n\n\n*Percentage of jobholders holding Hauptschulabschluss, Realschulabschluss or Abitur in Germany[95]*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **1970** | **1982** | **1991** | **2000** |\n| **Hauptschulabschluss** | 87,7%\n | 79,3%\n | 66,5%\n | 54,9%\n |\n| **Realschulabschluss** | 10,9%\n | 17,7%\n | 27%\n | 34,1%\n |\n| **Abitur** | 1,4%\n | 3%\n | 6,5%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\nOver 99% of those of age 15 and above are estimated to be able to read and write. However, a growing number of inhabitants are functionally illiterate. The young are much more likely to be functionally illiterate than the old. According to a study done by the University of Bremen in cooperation with the \"Bundesverband Alphabetisierung e.V.\", 10% of youngsters living in Germany are functionally illiterate and one quarter are able to understand only basic level texts.[96] Illiteracy rates of youngsters vary by ethnic group and parents' socioeconomic class.\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Germany\n\nThe life expectancy in Germany is 81.1 years (78.7 years males, 83.6 years females, 2020 est.).[97] \nAs of 2009[update], the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 42%, followed by malignant tumours, at 25%.[98]\nAs of 2008[update], about 82,000 Germans had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 26,000 had died from the disease (cumulatively, since 1982).[99]\nAccording to a 2005 survey, 27% of German adults are smokers.[99]\nA 2009 study shows Germany is near the median in terms of overweight and obese people in Europe.[100]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Germany\n\n![](image)2020 map of Christian denominations in the states of Germany Roman Catholic majority\n Christian majority, Catholic plurality\n Christian majority, EKD plurality\n Christians less than 50% of population, majority of Christians belong to EKD\n\nThe national constitutions of 1919 and 1949 guarantee freedom of faith and religion; earlier, these freedoms were mentioned only in state constitutions. The modern constitution of 1949 also states that no one may be discriminated against due to their faith or religious opinions. A state church does not exist in Germany (see Freedom of religion in Germany).[101]\n\n\nAccording to a 1990s poll by *Der Spiegel*, 45% of Germans believe in God, and a quarter in Jesus Christ.[102] According to the Eurobarometer Poll 2010, 44% of German citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", 25% responded that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\" and 27% responded that \"they don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force\". 4% gave no response.[103]\n\n\nChristianity is the largest religion in Germany, comprising an estimated 53.9% of the country's population.[104][105]\n\n\nSmaller religious groups (less than 1%) include Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism.[106][104]\n\n\nThe two largest churches, the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD), have lost significant number of adherents. In 2020 the Catholic Church accounted for 26.7%[104][105][107] and the Evangelical Church for 24.3%[104][105][108] of the population. Orthodox Church has 1.9% and other Christian churches and groups summed up to 1.1% of the population.[104][106] Since the reunification of Germany, the number of non-religious people has grown and an estimated 40.7% of the country's population are not affiliated with any church or religion.[104][105][106]\n\n\nThe other religions make up to less than 1% of the population.[106] Buddhism has around 200,000 adherents (0.2%), Judaism has around 200,000 adherents (0.2%), Hinduism 90,000 (0.1%), Sikhism 75,000 (0.1%) and Yazidis religion (45,000–60,000).[109] All other religious communities in Germany have fewer than 50,000 (<0.1%) adherents.\n\n\n\n| Religion in Germany (2020)[104][105] |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| No Religion |  | 40.7% |\n| Roman Catholicism |  | 26.7% |\n| Protestant Church |  | 24.3% |\n| Islam |  | 3.5% |\n| Orthodox Church |  | 1.9% |\n| Other Christians |  | 1.1% |\n| Other Religions |  | 0.9% |\n\nProtestantism is concentrated in the north and east and Roman Catholicism is concentrated in the south and west. According to the last nationwide census, Protestantism is more widespread among the population with German citizenship; there are slightly more Catholics total because of the Catholic immigrant population (including such groups as Poles and Italians).[110] The former Pope, Benedict XVI, was born in Bavaria. Non-religious people, including atheists and agnostics, might make up as many as 55% of the total population, and are especially numerous in the former East Germany and major metropolitan areas.[111]\n\n\nOf the roughly 4 million Muslims, most are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites and other denominations.[112][113] 1.9% of the country's overall population declare themselves Orthodox Christians,[104] with Serbs, Greeks, Romanians, Ukrainians and Russians being the most numerous.[114] Germany has Europe's third-largest Jewish population (after France and the United Kingdom).[115] In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total Jewish population to more than 200,000, compared to 30,000 prior to German reunification. Large cities with significant Jewish populations include Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich.[116] Around 250,000 active Buddhists live in Germany; 50% of them are Asian immigrants.[117]\n\n\n\n### 2011 Census[edit]\n\n\n**Religion (2011 German Census)**\n\n\n\nCatholic Church (30.8%)\nEKD (30.3%)\nOther, atheist or unspecified[118] (38.9%)\n\nCensus results were as follows:\n\n\n\n* Roman Catholic Church: 24,740,380 or 30.8% of the German population;\n* Protestant Church: 24,328,100 or 30.3% of the German population;\n* Other, atheist or not specified (including Protestants outside EKD): 31,151,210 or 38.9% of the German population.[110]\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Germany\n\nGerman is the only official and most widely spoken language. Standard German is understood throughout the country.\n\n\nIn 2021, the Federal Statistical Office of Germany included a new question regarding the language spoken at home in the micro-census, a large sample survey that yearly covers approximately 1% of the German population living in private households, and the results were as follows:[119]\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguages spoken at home, 2022 micro census\n| Language\n | Absolute number\n | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total population\n | 83,103,000\n | 100.00\n |\n| Only German\n | 65,440,000\n | 78.75\n |\n| Mostly German\n | 4,125,000\n | 4.96\n |\n| Mostly another language\n | 13,538,000\n | 16.29\n |\n| Of which\n | Albanian | 509,000\n | 0.61\n |\n|  | Arabic | 1,348,000\n | 1.62\n |\n| Bosnian | 237,000\n | 0.29\n |\n| Bulgarian | 218,000\n | 0.26\n |\n| Chinese | 145,000\n | 0.17\n |\n| Danish | 15,000\n | 0.02\n |\n| English | 861,000\n | 1.04\n |\n| French | 190,000\n | 0.23\n |\n| Greek | 286,000\n | 0.34\n |\n| Italian | 496,000\n | 0.60\n |\n| Croatian | 384,000\n | 0.46\n |\n| Kurdish | 511,000\n | 0.61\n |\n| Macedonian | 87,000\n | 0.10\n |\n| Dutch | 97,000\n | 0.12\n |\n| Pahto | 36,000\n | 0.04\n |\n| Persian | 391,000\n | 0.47\n |\n| Polish | 937,000\n | 1.13\n |\n| Portuguese | 167,000\n | 0.20\n |\n| Romanian | 670,000\n | 0.81\n |\n| Russian | 1,639,000\n | 1.97\n |\n| Serbian | 252,000\n | 0.30\n |\n| Spanish | 284,000\n | 0.34\n |\n| Turkish | 1,879,000\n | 2.26\n |\n| Hungarian | 203,000\n | 0.24\n |\n| Ukrainian | 191,000\n | 0.23\n |\n| Vietnamese | 138,000\n | 0.17\n |\n| Another European\nlanguage\n | 277,000\n | 0.33\n |\n| Another African\nlanguage\n | 243,000\n | 0.29\n |\n| Another Asian\nlanguage\n | 514,000\n | 0.62\n |\n|  | Another language\n | 333,000\n | 0.4\n |\n\n\n### Minority languages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bilingual German-Sorbian city limit signs\nDanish, Low German, Low Rhenish, the Sorbian languages (Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian), and the two Frisian languages, Saterfrisian and North Frisian, are officially recognized and protected as minority languages by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in their respective regions. With speakers of Romany living in all parts of Germany, the federal government has promised to take action to protect the language. Until now, only Hesse has followed Berlin's announcement, and agreed on implementing concrete measures to support Romany speakers.\n\n\nGermany is a strong supporter of the Charter, as evidenced by things like the 2022 report from the Secretary General of the Council of Europe specifically naming Germany as an example of how to incorporate minority languages in State media.[120][121] Still, Germany—like many other signatories of the Charter—has room for improvement in its implementation of the Charter.[122]\n\n\n\n\n\nProtected Minority Languages in Germany\n| Language | States\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Danish | Schleswig-Holstein |\n| North Frisian | Schleswig-Holstein |\n| Saterland Frisian | Lower Saxony |\n| Low German | Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein, North Rhine-Westphalia |\n| Low Rhenish | North Rhine-Westphalia |\n| Upper Sorbian | Saxony |\n| Lower Sorbian | Brandenburg |\n| Romany | Hesse *de facto*, *de jure* in all states (see text)\n |\n\n\n### High German dialects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)City limits sign; this city is called *Emlichheim* in High German and *Emmelkamp* in Low German.\nGerman dialects – some quite distinct from the standard language – are used in everyday speech, especially in rural regions. Many dialects, for example the Upper German varieties, are to some degree cultivated as symbols of regional identity and have their own literature, theaters and some TV programming. While speaking a dialect outside its native region might be frowned upon, in their native regions some dialects can be spoken by all social classes.[*citation needed*] Nevertheless, partly due to the prevalence of Standard German in media, the use of dialects has declined over the past century, especially in the younger population.\n\n\nThe social status of different German dialects can vary greatly. The Alemannic and Bavarian dialects of the south are positively valued by their speakers and can be used in almost all social circumstances. The Saxonian and Thuringian dialects have less prestige and are subject to derision. While Bavarian and Alemannic have kept much of their distinctiveness, the Middle German dialects, which are closer to Standard German, have lost some of their distinctive lexical and grammatical features and tend to be only pronunciation variants of Standard German.\n\n\n\n### Low Saxon dialects[edit]\n\n\nLow Saxon is officially recognized as a language on its own, but despite this fact, there's little official action taken on fostering the language. Historically one third of Germany's territory and population was Low Saxon speaking. No data was ever collected on the actual number of speakers, but today the number of speakers ranges around 5 million persons. Despite this relatively high number of speakers there is very little coverage in the media (mostly on NDR TV, no regular programming) and very little education in or on the language. The language is not fixed as part of the school curriculum and Low Saxon is used as a medium of instruction in one school only in the whole Germany (as a \"model project\" in primary school sided by education in Standard German). As a consequence the younger generation refused to adopt the native language of their parents. Language prevalence dropped from more than 90% (depending on the exact region) in the 1930s to less than 5% today. This accounts for a massive intergenerational gap in language use. Older people regularly use the language and take private initiative to maintain the language, but the lack of innovative potential of the younger generation hinders language maintenance. The language too has an own literature (around 150 published books every year) and there are many theatres (mostly lay stages, but some professional ones, like for example Ohnsorg-Theater).\n\n\nUse of Low Saxon is mainly restricted to use among acquaintances, like family members, neighbours and friends. A meeting of a village council can be held almost completely in Low Saxon if all participants know each other (as long as written protocols are written in Standard German), but a single foreigner can make the whole switching to Standard German.\n\n\nThe Low Saxon dialects are different in their status too. There's a north–south gradient in language maintenance. The Southern dialects of Westfalian, Eastfalian and Brandenburgish have had much stronger speaker losses, than the northern coastal dialects of Northern Low Saxon. While Eastfalian has lost speakers to Standard German, Westfalian has lost speakers to Standard German and Standard German based regiolect of the Rhine-Ruhr area. Brandenburgish speakers mostly switched to the Standard German-based regiolect of Berlin. Brandenburgish is almost completely replaced by the Berlin regiolect. Northern Low Saxon speakers switched mostly to pure Standard German.\n\n\n\n### Foreign languages[edit]\n\n\nEnglish is the most common foreign language and almost universally taught by the secondary level; it is also taught at elementary level in some states. Other commonly-taught languages are French, Italian, Spanish and Russian. Dutch is taught in states bordering the Netherlands, and Polish in the eastern states bordering Poland.[123]Latin and Ancient Greek are part of the classical education syllabus offered in many secondary schools.\n\n\nAccording to a 2004 survey, two-thirds of Germany's citizens have at least basic knowledge of English.[*citation needed*] About 20% consider themselves to be competent speakers of French, followed by speakers of Russian (7%), Italian (6.1%), and Spanish (5.6%). The relatively high number of Russian speakers is a result of immigration from the former Soviet Union to Germany for almost 10 consecutive years, plus its having been learned in school by many older former East Germans as compulsory first foreign language.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Germany portal\n* ![flag](image)European Union portal\n\n\n* Germans\n* Census in Germany\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In fertility rates, 2.1 and above is a stable population and have been marked blue, 2 and below leads to an aging population and a reducing population.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Bevölkerungsstand\".

Those born during the World wars are marked in dark\nDemographic features of the population of Italy include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects.\n\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, Italy had an estimated population of 58,9 million. Its population density, at 197 inhabitants per square kilometre (510/sq mi), is higher than that of most Western European countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven; the most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (which contains about a third of the country's population) in northern Italy and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples in central and southern Italy, while other vast areas are very sparsely populated, like the plateaus of Basilicata, the Alps and Apennines highlands, and the island of Sardinia.\n\n\nThe population of the country almost doubled during the twentieth century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven due to large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North, a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the Italian economic miracle of the 1950–1960s. In addition, after centuries of net emigration, from the 1980s Italy has experienced large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history. Italian government data, in its annual report for 2019, estimated the amount of foreign nationals residing within Italy, including immigrants, to be at approximately 5.234 million people.[3] Due to such large-scale immigration to the country, particularly from the early 2000s to 2014, the population peaked at 60.79 million. Since then, decreasing migration, a continuously falling birth rate, and continuous aging have led to a sharp decrease in the Italian population.\n\n\nHigh fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to dramatically decline, leading to rapid population aging. At the end of the late 2000s, one in five Italians were over 65 years old.[4] Italy has experienced a short growth in birth rates.[5] The total fertility rate temporarily rose from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.46 in 2010.[6] Since then, fertility rates continued to drop, to reach a low of 1.24 in 2020.\n\n\nSince the revision of the Lateran Treaty in 1984, Italy has no official religion, although it continues to recognize the role the Catholic Church plays in Italian society. In 2017, 78% of the population identified as Catholic, 15% as non-believers or atheists, 2% as other Christians and 6% adhered to other religions.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Historical overview[edit]\n\n\n### 1861 to early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Italian diaspora\n\n![](image)Map of the Italian diaspora in the world\nFrom its unification in 1861 to the Italian economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s, Italy has been a country of mass emigration. Between 1898 and 1914, the peak years of Italian diaspora, approximately 750,000 Italians emigrated each year.[8] As a consequence, large numbers of people with full or significant Italian ancestry are found in Brazil (32 million Italian Brazilians),[9][10] Argentina (25 million Italian Argentines),[11] United States (18 million Italian Americans),[12] France (5 million Italian French),[13] Venezuela (5 million Italian Venezuelans),[14] Paraguay (2.5 million Italian Paraguayans),[15][16][17] Colombia (2 million Italian Colombians),[18] Uruguay (1.5 million Italian Uruguayans),[19] Peru (1.5 million Italian Peruvians),[20] Canada (1.5 million Italian Canadians),[21] Germany (1.2 million Italian Germans)[22] and Australia (1 million Italian Australians).[23] In addition, Italian communities once thrived in the former African colonies of Eritrea (nearly 100,000 at the beginning of World War II),[24] Somalia and Libya (150,000 Italians settled in Libya, constituting about 18% of the total Libyan population).[25]\n\n\n\n### After World War II[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Istrian Italians leave Pola in 1947 during the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus\nAfter Tito's annexation of Istria, Kvarner, most of the Julian March as well as the Dalmatian city of Zara following the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947, up to 350,000 local ethnic Italians (Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians) left communist Yugoslavia (Istrian–Dalmatian exodus).[26][27] Furthermore, all of Libya's Italians were expelled after Muammar Gaddafi's takeover in 1970.[28]\n\n\nAs a result of the profound economic and social changes brought by rapid postwar economic growth, including low birth rates, an aging population and thus a shrinking workforce, by the 1970s emigration had all but stopped and Italy started to have a positive net migration rate.[29] The nation's immigrant population reached 5 million by 2015, making up some 8% of the total population.[30] However, the long-lasting effects of the Eurozone crisis double-dip recession strongly slowed down immigration rates in Italy in the 2010s.[31]\n\n\nFrom January 2020 and December 2021 as a direct effect of COVID-19 pandemic and Deltacron hybrid variant, Italy has registered at least 178,000 excess deaths, a loss of about 1.4 years in the average life expectancy, a noticeable decrease in births rates and a marked decrease in immigration rates, the overall effect being a record natural population decline of 342,042 units in that year, the largest ever recorded since 1918 (at the time of World War I and Spanish flu pandemic).[32] In 2022, Italy's birth rate declined to its lowest level on record since 1861, with fewer then 400,000 births recorded that year.[33][34][35][36][37][38]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Historic population of Italy\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1861  | 21,777,334 | —     |\n| 1871  | 26,801,154 | +2.10% |\n| 1881  | 28,459,628 | +0.60% |\n| 1901  | 32,475,253 | +0.66% |\n| 1911  | 34,671,377 | +0.66% |\n| 1921  | 37,973,977 | +0.91% |\n| 1931  | 41,176,671 | +0.81% |\n| 1936  | 42,993,602 | +0.87% |\n| 1951  | 47,515,537 | +0.67% |\n| 1961  | 50,623,569 | +0.64% |\n| 1971  | 54,136,547 | +0.67% |\n| 1981  | 56,556,911 | +0.44% |\n| 1991  | 56,778,031 | +0.04% |\n| 2001  | 56,995,744 | +0.04% |\n| 2011  | 59,433,744 | +0.42% |\n| 2021 (est.)  | 59,257,566 | −0.03% |\n| Source: ISTAT[39][40][32] |\n\n\nFurther information: Italians\n\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review in 2022.[41]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 1 minute 18 seconds\n* One death every 50 seconds\n* Net loss of one person every 3 minutes 6 seconds\n* One net migrant every 9 minutes\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

The distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in Italy: 83% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 17% live in the southern half of the peninsula.[72]\n\n\n\nNet migration rate\n\n3.21 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2021 est.)

Ethnologue has estimated that there are about 55 million speakers of Italian in the country and a further 6.7 million outside of it, primarily in the neighboring countries and in the Italian diaspora worldwide.[88] Italian, adopted by the central state after the unification of Italy, is a language based on the Florentine variety of Tuscan and is somewhat intermediate between the Italo-Dalmatian languages and the Gallo-Romance languages. Its development was also influenced by the Germanic languages of the post-Roman invaders. When Italy unified in 1861, only 3% of the population spoke Italian,[89] even though an estimated 90% of Italians speak Italian as their L1 nowadays.[90]\n\n\nItaly is in fact one of the most linguistically diverse countries in Europe,[91] as there are not only varieties of Italian specific to each cultural region, but also distinct regional and minority languages. The establishment of the national education system has led to the emergence of the former and a decrease in the use of the latter. The spread of Italian was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, because of the economic growth and the rise of mass media and television, with the state broadcaster (RAI) setting a colloquial variety of Italian to which the population would be exposed.\n\n\nAs a way to distance itself from the Italianization policies promoted because of nationalism, Italy recognized twelve languages as the Country's \"historical linguistic minorities\",[92] which are promoted alongside Italian in their respective territories. French is co-official in the Aosta Valley as the province's prestige variety, under which the more commonly spoken Franco-Provencal dialects have been historically roofed.[93] German has the same status in the province of South Tyrol as, in some parts of that province and in parts of the neighbouring Trentino, does Ladin.[94] Slovene[95] and Friulian are officially recognised in the provinces of Trieste, Gorizia and Udine in Venezia Giulia. In Sardinia, the Sardinian language has been the language traditionally spoken and is often regarded by linguists as constituting its own branch of Romance;[96] in the 1990s, Sardinian has been recognized as \"having equal dignity\" with Italian,[97] the introduction of which to the island officially started under the rule of the House of Savoy in the 18th century.\n\n\nIn these regions, official documents are either bilingual (trilingual in Ladin communities) in the co-official language(s) by default, or available as such upon request. Traffic signs are also multilingual, except in the Valle d'Aosta where French toponyms are generally used, with the exception of Aosta itself, which has retained its Latin form in Italian as well as English. Attempts to Italianize them, especially during the Fascist period, have been formally abandoned. Education is possible in minority languages where such schools are operating.\n\n\nUNESCO and other authorities recognize a number of other languages which are not legally protected by Italian government: Piedmontese, Venetian, Ligurian, Lombard, Emilian-Romagnolo, Neapolitan and Sicilian.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Italy\n\nReligion in Italy according to the Eurobarometer survey, 2021[98]\n\n\n\nCatholicism (79.2%)\nEastern Orthodoxy (3.5%)\nProtestantism (0.3%)\nOther Christian (1.4%)\nIslam (1.0%)\nBuddhism (0.4%)\nHinduism/Sikhism (0.3%)\nJudaism (0.1%)\nOther (1.4%)\nAgnosticism (7.5%)\nAtheism (4.1%)\nUndeclared (1.0%)\n\nRoman Catholicism is by far the largest religion in the country, although the Catholic Church is no longer officially the state religion. In 2006, 87.8% of Italy's population self-identified as Roman Catholic,[99] although only about one-third of these described themselves as active members (36.8%). In 2016, 71.1% of *Italian citizens* self-identified as Roman Catholic.[100] This increased again to 78% in 2018.[7]\n\n\nMost Italians believe in God, or a form of a spiritual life force. According to a Eurobarometer Poll in 2005:[101] 74% of Italian citizens responded that 'they believe there is a God', 16% answered that 'they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force' and 6% answered that 'they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force'. There are no data collected through census.\n\n\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nThe Italian Catholic Church is part of the global Roman Catholic Church, under the leadership of the Pope, curia in Rome, and the Conference of Italian Bishops. In addition to Italy, two other sovereign nations are included in Italian-based dioceses, San Marino and Vatican City. There are 225 dioceses in the Italian Catholic Church, see further in this article and in the article List of the Roman Catholic dioceses in Italy. Even though by law Vatican City is not part of Italy, it is in Rome, and along with Latin, Italian is the most spoken and second language of the Roman Curia.[102]\n\n\nItaly has a rich Catholic culture, especially as numerous Catholic saints, martyrs and popes were Italian themselves. Roman Catholic art in Italy especially flourished during the Middle Ages, Renaissance and Baroque periods, with numerous Italian artists, such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Caravaggio, Fra Angelico, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Sandro Botticelli, Tintoretto, Titian and Giotto. Roman Catholic architecture in Italy is equally as rich and impressive, with churches, basilicas and cathedrals such as St Peter's Basilica, Florence Cathedral and St Mark's Basilica. Roman Catholicism is the largest religion and denomination in Italy, with around 71.1% of Italians considering themselves Catholic. Italy is also home to the greatest number of cardinals in the world,[103] and is the country with the greatest number of Roman Catholic churches per capita.[104]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral in Florence, which has the biggest brick dome in the world,[105][106] and is considered a masterpiece of Italian architecture.\nEven though the main Christian denomination in Italy is Roman Catholicism, there are some minorities of Protestant, Waldensian, Eastern Orthodox and other Christian churches.\n\n\nImmigration from Western, Central, and Eastern Africa at the beginning of the 21st century has increased the size of Baptist, Anglican, Pentecostal and Evangelical communities in Italy, while immigration from Eastern Europe has produced large Eastern Orthodox communities.\n\n\nIn 2006, Protestants made up 2.1% of Italy's population, and members of Eastern Orthodox churches comprised 1.2% or more than 700,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians including 180,000 Greek Orthodox,[107] 550,000 Pentecostals and Evangelists (0.8%), of whom 400,000 are members of the Assemblies of God, about 250,000 are Jehovah's Witnesses (0.4%),[108] 30,000 Waldensians,[109] 25,000 Seventh-day Adventists, 22,000 Mormons, 15,000 Baptists (plus some 5,000 Free Baptists), 7,000 Lutherans, 4,000 Methodists (affiliated with the Waldensian Church).[110]\n\n\n\n### Other religions[edit]\n\n\nThe longest-established religious faith in Italy is Judaism, Jews having been present in Ancient Rome before the birth of Christ. Italy has seen many influential Italian-Jews, such as prime minister Luigi Luzzatti, who took office in 1910, Ernesto Nathan served as mayor of Rome from 1907 to 1913 and Shabbethai Donnolo (died 982). During the Holocaust, Italy took in many Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. However, with the creation of the Nazi-backed puppet Italian Social Republic, about 15% of 48,000 Italian Jews were killed. This, together with the emigration that preceded and followed the Second World War, has left only a small community of around 45,000 Jews in Italy today.\n\n\nDue to immigration from around the world, there has been an increase in non-Christian religions. As of 2009, there were 1.0 million Muslims in Italy[111] forming 1.6 percent of population; independent estimates put the Islamic population in Italy anywhere from 0.8 million[112] to 1.5 million.[113] 50,000 Italian Muslims hold Italian citizenship.\n\n\nThere are more than 200,000 followers of faiths originating in the Indian subcontinent, including some 70,000 Sikhs with 22 gurdwaras across the country,[114] 70,000 Hindus, and 50,000 Buddhists.[115] There were an estimated 4,900 Bahá'ís in Italy in 2005.[116]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n**Literacy**\n\n\n\n\n*definition:* age 15 and over can read and write\ntotal population: 99.2%\nmale: 99.4%\nfemale: 99% (2018 est.)\n**School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)**\n\n\n\n\ntotal: 16 years\nmale: 16 years\nfemale: 17 years (2018)\n## Genetics and ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Genetic history of Italy\n\n![](image)Principal Component Analysis of the Italian population.[117]\nThe genetic history of Italy is greatly influenced by geography and history. The ancestors of Italians are mostly Indo-European speakers (Italic peoples such as Latins,  Umbrians, Samnites, Oscans, Sicels and Adriatic Veneti, as well as Celts, Iapygians and Greeks) and pre-Indo-European speakers (Etruscans, Ligures, Rhaetians and Camunni in mainland Italy, Sicani and Elymians in Sicily and the Nuragic people in Sardinia). During the imperial period of Ancient Rome, the city of Rome was also home to people from various regions throughout the Mediterranean basin, including Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.[118] Based on DNA analysis, there is evidence of ancient regional genetic substructure and continuity within modern Italy dating to the pre-Roman and Roman periods.[119][120][121][122]\n\n\nWithin the Italian population, there is enough cultural, linguistic, genetic and historical diversity for them to constitute several distinct groups throughout the peninsula.[123] In this regard, peoples like the Friulians, the Ladins, the Sardinians and the South Tyroleans, who also happen to constitute recognized linguistic minorities, or even the Sicilians who are not, are cases in point, attesting to such internal diversity.\n\n\nLinguistic minorities in Italy include Sardu-speakers 1 million, Tyrolese German-speakers 350,000, Albanians 70,000 – 100,000, Slovenes 60,000, Franco-Provençal-speakers 50,000 – 70,000, Occitans 20,000 – 40,000, Ladins 30,000, Catalans 15,000, Greek-speakers 12,000, Croatians 3,000 and Friulians 600,000. The Roma community is one of the largest ethnic minorities in Italy. Due to the lack of disaggregated data the size of the Italian Roma community remains unknown. The Council of Europe estimates that between 120,000 and 180,000 Roma live in Italy. A significant proportion of Roma in Italy don’t have Italian citizenship.[124]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Italy portal\n\n\n* List of Italians\n* Italian diaspora\n* Italian Americans\n* Italian Brazilians\n* Italian Argentines\n* Italian Venezuelans\n* Romani people in Italy\n\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In fertility rates, 2.1 and above is a stable population and has been marked blue, 2 and below leads to an aging population and the result is that the population decreases.\n\n1. **^** The figures for 2002–2011 have been revised downwards as a result of the 15th General Census of Italy which offered more precise data.

Interestingly, although Iron Age individuals were sampled from both Etruscan (n=3) and Latin (n=6) contexts, we did not detect any significant differences between the two groups with f4 statistics in the form of f4(RMPR\\_Etruscan, RMPR\\_Latin; test population, Onge), suggesting shared origins or extensive genetic exchange between them. ... In the Medieval and early modern periods (n = 28 individuals), we observe an ancestry shift toward central and northern Europe in PCA (Fig. 3E), as well as a further increase in the European cluster (C7) and loss of the Near Eastern and eastern Mediterranean clusters (C4 and C5) in ChromoPainter (Fig. 4C). The Medieval population is roughly centered on modern-day central Italians (Fig. 3F). It can be modeled as a two-way combination of Rome's Late Antique population and a European donor population, with potential sources including many ancient and modern populations in central and northern Europe: Lombards from Hungary, Saxons from England, and Vikings from Sweden, among others (table S26).\n119. **^** Ralph P, Coop G (2013). \"The geography of recent genetic ancestry across Europe\". *PLOS Biology*. **11** (5): e1001555. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001555.

Those born during the World wars are marked in dark\nDemographic features of the population of Italy include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects.\n\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, Italy had an estimated population of 58,9 million. Its population density, at 197 inhabitants per square kilometre (510/sq mi), is higher than that of most Western European countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven; the most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (which contains about a third of the country's population) in northern Italy and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples in central and southern Italy, while other vast areas are very sparsely populated, like the plateaus of Basilicata, the Alps and Apennines highlands, and the island of Sardinia.\n\n\nThe population of the country almost doubled during the twentieth century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven due to large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North, a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the Italian economic miracle of the 1950–1960s. In addition, after centuries of net emigration, from the 1980s Italy has experienced large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history. Italian government data, in its annual report for 2019, estimated the amount of foreign nationals residing within Italy, including immigrants, to be at approximately 5.234 million people.[3] Due to such large-scale immigration to the country, particularly from the early 2000s to 2014, the population peaked at 60.79 million. Since then, decreasing migration, a continuously falling birth rate, and continuous aging have led to a sharp decrease in the Italian population.\n\n\nHigh fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to dramatically decline, leading to rapid population aging. At the end of the late 2000s, one in five Italians were over 65 years old.[4] Italy has experienced a short growth in birth rates.[5] The total fertility rate temporarily rose from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.46 in 2010.[6] Since then, fertility rates continued to drop, to reach a low of 1.24 in 2020.\n\n\nSince the revision of the Lateran Treaty in 1984, Italy has no official religion, although it continues to recognize the role the Catholic Church plays in Italian society. In 2017, 78% of the population identified as Catholic, 15% as non-believers or atheists, 2% as other Christians and 6% adhered to other religions.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Historical overview[edit]\n\n\n### 1861 to early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Italian diaspora\n\n![](image)Map of the Italian diaspora in the world\nFrom its unification in 1861 to the Italian economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s, Italy has been a country of mass emigration. Between 1898 and 1914, the peak years of Italian diaspora, approximately 750,000 Italians emigrated each year.[8] As a consequence, large numbers of people with full or significant Italian ancestry are found in Brazil (32 million Italian Brazilians),[9][10] Argentina (25 million Italian Argentines),[11] United States (18 million Italian Americans),[12] France (5 million Italian French),[13] Venezuela (5 million Italian Venezuelans),[14] Paraguay (2.5 million Italian Paraguayans),[15][16][17] Colombia (2 million Italian Colombians),[18] Uruguay (1.5 million Italian Uruguayans),[19] Peru (1.5 million Italian Peruvians),[20] Canada (1.5 million Italian Canadians),[21] Germany (1.2 million Italian Germans)[22] and Australia (1 million Italian Australians).[23] In addition, Italian communities once thrived in the former African colonies of Eritrea (nearly 100,000 at the beginning of World War II),[24] Somalia and Libya (150,000 Italians settled in Libya, constituting about 18% of the total Libyan population).[25]\n\n\n\n### After World War II[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Istrian Italians leave Pola in 1947 during the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus\nAfter Tito's annexation of Istria, Kvarner, most of the Julian March as well as the Dalmatian city of Zara following the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947, up to 350,000 local ethnic Italians (Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians) left communist Yugoslavia (Istrian–Dalmatian exodus).[26][27] Furthermore, all of Libya's Italians were expelled after Muammar Gaddafi's takeover in 1970.[28]\n\n\nAs a result of the profound economic and social changes brought by rapid postwar economic growth, including low birth rates, an aging population and thus a shrinking workforce, by the 1970s emigration had all but stopped and Italy started to have a positive net migration rate.[29] The nation's immigrant population reached 5 million by 2015, making up some 8% of the total population.[30] However, the long-lasting effects of the Eurozone crisis double-dip recession strongly slowed down immigration rates in Italy in the 2010s.[31]\n\n\nFrom January 2020 and December 2021 as a direct effect of COVID-19 pandemic and Deltacron hybrid variant, Italy has registered at least 178,000 excess deaths, a loss of about 1.4 years in the average life expectancy, a noticeable decrease in births rates and a marked decrease in immigration rates, the overall effect being a record natural population decline of 342,042 units in that year, the largest ever recorded since 1918 (at the time of World War I and Spanish flu pandemic).[32] In 2022, Italy's birth rate declined to its lowest level on record since 1861, with fewer then 400,000 births recorded that year.[33][34][35][36][37][38]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Historic population of Italy\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1861  | 21,777,334 | —     |\n| 1871  | 26,801,154 | +2.10% |\n| 1881  | 28,459,628 | +0.60% |\n| 1901  | 32,475,253 | +0.66% |\n| 1911  | 34,671,377 | +0.66% |\n| 1921  | 37,973,977 | +0.91% |\n| 1931  | 41,176,671 | +0.81% |\n| 1936  | 42,993,602 | +0.87% |\n| 1951  | 47,515,537 | +0.67% |\n| 1961  | 50,623,569 | +0.64% |\n| 1971  | 54,136,547 | +0.67% |\n| 1981  | 56,556,911 | +0.44% |\n| 1991  | 56,778,031 | +0.04% |\n| 2001  | 56,995,744 | +0.04% |\n| 2011  | 59,433,744 | +0.42% |\n| 2021 (est.)  | 59,257,566 | −0.03% |\n| Source: ISTAT[39][40][32] |\n\n\nFurther information: Italians\n\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review in 2022.[41]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 1 minute 18 seconds\n* One death every 50 seconds\n* Net loss of one person every 3 minutes 6 seconds\n* One net migrant every 9 minutes\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

The distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in Italy: 83% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 17% live in the southern half of the peninsula.[72]\n\n\n\nNet migration rate\n\n3.21 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2021 est.)

Ethnologue has estimated that there are about 55 million speakers of Italian in the country and a further 6.7 million outside of it, primarily in the neighboring countries and in the Italian diaspora worldwide.[88] Italian, adopted by the central state after the unification of Italy, is a language based on the Florentine variety of Tuscan and is somewhat intermediate between the Italo-Dalmatian languages and the Gallo-Romance languages. Its development was also influenced by the Germanic languages of the post-Roman invaders. When Italy unified in 1861, only 3% of the population spoke Italian,[89] even though an estimated 90% of Italians speak Italian as their L1 nowadays.[90]\n\n\nItaly is in fact one of the most linguistically diverse countries in Europe,[91] as there are not only varieties of Italian specific to each cultural region, but also distinct regional and minority languages. The establishment of the national education system has led to the emergence of the former and a decrease in the use of the latter. The spread of Italian was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, because of the economic growth and the rise of mass media and television, with the state broadcaster (RAI) setting a colloquial variety of Italian to which the population would be exposed.\n\n\nAs a way to distance itself from the Italianization policies promoted because of nationalism, Italy recognized twelve languages as the Country's \"historical linguistic minorities\",[92] which are promoted alongside Italian in their respective territories. French is co-official in the Aosta Valley as the province's prestige variety, under which the more commonly spoken Franco-Provencal dialects have been historically roofed.[93] German has the same status in the province of South Tyrol as, in some parts of that province and in parts of the neighbouring Trentino, does Ladin.[94] Slovene[95] and Friulian are officially recognised in the provinces of Trieste, Gorizia and Udine in Venezia Giulia. In Sardinia, the Sardinian language has been the language traditionally spoken and is often regarded by linguists as constituting its own branch of Romance;[96] in the 1990s, Sardinian has been recognized as \"having equal dignity\" with Italian,[97] the introduction of which to the island officially started under the rule of the House of Savoy in the 18th century.\n\n\nIn these regions, official documents are either bilingual (trilingual in Ladin communities) in the co-official language(s) by default, or available as such upon request. Traffic signs are also multilingual, except in the Valle d'Aosta where French toponyms are generally used, with the exception of Aosta itself, which has retained its Latin form in Italian as well as English. Attempts to Italianize them, especially during the Fascist period, have been formally abandoned. Education is possible in minority languages where such schools are operating.\n\n\nUNESCO and other authorities recognize a number of other languages which are not legally protected by Italian government: Piedmontese, Venetian, Ligurian, Lombard, Emilian-Romagnolo, Neapolitan and Sicilian.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Italy\n\nReligion in Italy according to the Eurobarometer survey, 2021[98]\n\n\n\nCatholicism (79.2%)\nEastern Orthodoxy (3.5%)\nProtestantism (0.3%)\nOther Christian (1.4%)\nIslam (1.0%)\nBuddhism (0.4%)\nHinduism/Sikhism (0.3%)\nJudaism (0.1%)\nOther (1.4%)\nAgnosticism (7.5%)\nAtheism (4.1%)\nUndeclared (1.0%)\n\nRoman Catholicism is by far the largest religion in the country, although the Catholic Church is no longer officially the state religion. In 2006, 87.8% of Italy's population self-identified as Roman Catholic,[99] although only about one-third of these described themselves as active members (36.8%). In 2016, 71.1% of *Italian citizens* self-identified as Roman Catholic.[100] This increased again to 78% in 2018.[7]\n\n\nMost Italians believe in God, or a form of a spiritual life force. According to a Eurobarometer Poll in 2005:[101] 74% of Italian citizens responded that 'they believe there is a God', 16% answered that 'they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force' and 6% answered that 'they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force'. There are no data collected through census.\n\n\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nThe Italian Catholic Church is part of the global Roman Catholic Church, under the leadership of the Pope, curia in Rome, and the Conference of Italian Bishops. In addition to Italy, two other sovereign nations are included in Italian-based dioceses, San Marino and Vatican City. There are 225 dioceses in the Italian Catholic Church, see further in this article and in the article List of the Roman Catholic dioceses in Italy. Even though by law Vatican City is not part of Italy, it is in Rome, and along with Latin, Italian is the most spoken and second language of the Roman Curia.[102]\n\n\nItaly has a rich Catholic culture, especially as numerous Catholic saints, martyrs and popes were Italian themselves. Roman Catholic art in Italy especially flourished during the Middle Ages, Renaissance and Baroque periods, with numerous Italian artists, such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Caravaggio, Fra Angelico, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Sandro Botticelli, Tintoretto, Titian and Giotto. Roman Catholic architecture in Italy is equally as rich and impressive, with churches, basilicas and cathedrals such as St Peter's Basilica, Florence Cathedral and St Mark's Basilica. Roman Catholicism is the largest religion and denomination in Italy, with around 71.1% of Italians considering themselves Catholic. Italy is also home to the greatest number of cardinals in the world,[103] and is the country with the greatest number of Roman Catholic churches per capita.[104]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral in Florence, which has the biggest brick dome in the world,[105][106] and is considered a masterpiece of Italian architecture.\nEven though the main Christian denomination in Italy is Roman Catholicism, there are some minorities of Protestant, Waldensian, Eastern Orthodox and other Christian churches.\n\n\nImmigration from Western, Central, and Eastern Africa at the beginning of the 21st century has increased the size of Baptist, Anglican, Pentecostal and Evangelical communities in Italy, while immigration from Eastern Europe has produced large Eastern Orthodox communities.\n\n\nIn 2006, Protestants made up 2.1% of Italy's population, and members of Eastern Orthodox churches comprised 1.2% or more than 700,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians including 180,000 Greek Orthodox,[107] 550,000 Pentecostals and Evangelists (0.8%), of whom 400,000 are members of the Assemblies of God, about 250,000 are Jehovah's Witnesses (0.4%),[108] 30,000 Waldensians,[109] 25,000 Seventh-day Adventists, 22,000 Mormons, 15,000 Baptists (plus some 5,000 Free Baptists), 7,000 Lutherans, 4,000 Methodists (affiliated with the Waldensian Church).[110]\n\n\n\n### Other religions[edit]\n\n\nThe longest-established religious faith in Italy is Judaism, Jews having been present in Ancient Rome before the birth of Christ. Italy has seen many influential Italian-Jews, such as prime minister Luigi Luzzatti, who took office in 1910, Ernesto Nathan served as mayor of Rome from 1907 to 1913 and Shabbethai Donnolo (died 982). During the Holocaust, Italy took in many Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. However, with the creation of the Nazi-backed puppet Italian Social Republic, about 15% of 48,000 Italian Jews were killed. This, together with the emigration that preceded and followed the Second World War, has left only a small community of around 45,000 Jews in Italy today.\n\n\nDue to immigration from around the world, there has been an increase in non-Christian religions. As of 2009, there were 1.0 million Muslims in Italy[111] forming 1.6 percent of population; independent estimates put the Islamic population in Italy anywhere from 0.8 million[112] to 1.5 million.[113] 50,000 Italian Muslims hold Italian citizenship.\n\n\nThere are more than 200,000 followers of faiths originating in the Indian subcontinent, including some 70,000 Sikhs with 22 gurdwaras across the country,[114] 70,000 Hindus, and 50,000 Buddhists.[115] There were an estimated 4,900 Bahá'ís in Italy in 2005.[116]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n**Literacy**\n\n\n\n\n*definition:* age 15 and over can read and write\ntotal population: 99.2%\nmale: 99.4%\nfemale: 99% (2018 est.)\n**School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)**\n\n\n\n\ntotal: 16 years\nmale: 16 years\nfemale: 17 years (2018)\n## Genetics and ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Genetic history of Italy\n\n![](image)Principal Component Analysis of the Italian population.[117]\nThe genetic history of Italy is greatly influenced by geography and history. The ancestors of Italians are mostly Indo-European speakers (Italic peoples such as Latins,  Umbrians, Samnites, Oscans, Sicels and Adriatic Veneti, as well as Celts, Iapygians and Greeks) and pre-Indo-European speakers (Etruscans, Ligures, Rhaetians and Camunni in mainland Italy, Sicani and Elymians in Sicily and the Nuragic people in Sardinia). During the imperial period of Ancient Rome, the city of Rome was also home to people from various regions throughout the Mediterranean basin, including Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.[118] Based on DNA analysis, there is evidence of ancient regional genetic substructure and continuity within modern Italy dating to the pre-Roman and Roman periods.[119][120][121][122]\n\n\nWithin the Italian population, there is enough cultural, linguistic, genetic and historical diversity for them to constitute several distinct groups throughout the peninsula.[123] In this regard, peoples like the Friulians, the Ladins, the Sardinians and the South Tyroleans, who also happen to constitute recognized linguistic minorities, or even the Sicilians who are not, are cases in point, attesting to such internal diversity.\n\n\nLinguistic minorities in Italy include Sardu-speakers 1 million, Tyrolese German-speakers 350,000, Albanians 70,000 – 100,000, Slovenes 60,000, Franco-Provençal-speakers 50,000 – 70,000, Occitans 20,000 – 40,000, Ladins 30,000, Catalans 15,000, Greek-speakers 12,000, Croatians 3,000 and Friulians 600,000. The Roma community is one of the largest ethnic minorities in Italy. Due to the lack of disaggregated data the size of the Italian Roma community remains unknown. The Council of Europe estimates that between 120,000 and 180,000 Roma live in Italy. A significant proportion of Roma in Italy don’t have Italian citizenship.[124]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Italy portal\n\n\n* List of Italians\n* Italian diaspora\n* Italian Americans\n* Italian Brazilians\n* Italian Argentines\n* Italian Venezuelans\n* Romani people in Italy\n\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In fertility rates, 2.1 and above is a stable population and has been marked blue, 2 and below leads to an aging population and the result is that the population decreases.\n\n1. **^** The figures for 2002–2011 have been revised downwards as a result of the 15th General Census of Italy which offered more precise data.

Interestingly, although Iron Age individuals were sampled from both Etruscan (n=3) and Latin (n=6) contexts, we did not detect any significant differences between the two groups with f4 statistics in the form of f4(RMPR\\_Etruscan, RMPR\\_Latin; test population, Onge), suggesting shared origins or extensive genetic exchange between them. ... In the Medieval and early modern periods (n = 28 individuals), we observe an ancestry shift toward central and northern Europe in PCA (Fig. 3E), as well as a further increase in the European cluster (C7) and loss of the Near Eastern and eastern Mediterranean clusters (C4 and C5) in ChromoPainter (Fig. 4C). The Medieval population is roughly centered on modern-day central Italians (Fig. 3F). It can be modeled as a two-way combination of Rome's Late Antique population and a European donor population, with potential sources including many ancient and modern populations in central and northern Europe: Lombards from Hungary, Saxons from England, and Vikings from Sweden, among others (table S26).\n119. **^** Ralph P, Coop G (2013). \"The geography of recent genetic ancestry across Europe\". *PLOS Biology*. **11** (5): e1001555. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001555.

The population density is 16.5 persons per square kilometer - well below the world average of 62 persons. Argentina's population growth rate in 2020 was estimated to be 0.35% annually, with a birth rate of 11.8 per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 8.3 per 1,000 inhabitants.\n\n\nThe proportion of people under 15, at 23,5%, is slightly below the world average (25%), and the cohort of people 65 and older is relatively high, at 12.7%. The percentage of senior citizens in Argentina has long been second only to Uruguay in Latin America and well above the world average, which is currently 9.8%.\n\n\nThe median age is approximately 32 years and life expectancy at birth is of 78 years.[7] According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines speak English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension), 9.3% speak Portuguese[8] and 5.9% speak Italian.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Argentina by population\n\nArgentina is highly urbanized,[7] with the ten largest metropolitan areas accounting for half of the population, and fewer than one in ten living in rural areas. About 3 million people live in Buenos Aires proper, and including suburban Greater Buenos Aires the metropolitan area totals around 14 million - making it one of the 15 largest urban areas in the world.[10] The metropolitan areas of Córdoba and Rosario have around 1.3 million inhabitants each,[10] and six other cities (Mendoza, Tucumán, La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe)[10][11] have at least half a million people each.\n\n\nThe population is unequally distributed amongst the provinces, with 61% living in the Pampa region (21% of the total area), including 17.5 million people in Buenos Aires Province, 4 million in Córdoba Province, and over 3 million each in Santa Fe Province and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Eight other provinces each have over one million people: Mendoza, Tucumán, Salta, Entre Ríos, Misiones, Corrientes, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero. Tucumán is the most densely populated (with 75 inhabitants/km2, the only Argentine province more densely populated than the world average), while the southern province of Santa Cruz has just 1.4 inhabitant/km2.[12]\n\n\nIn the mid-19th century, a large wave of immigration started to arrive to Argentina due to new constitutional policies that encouraged immigration, and issues in the countries the immigrants came from such as wars, poverty, hunger, famines, pursuit of a better life, among other reasons. The main immigration sources were from Europe, the countries from the Near and Middle East, Russia and Japan. In fact, the immigration torrent was so strong that Argentina eventually received the second-largest number of immigrants in the world, second only to the US and ahead of such immigrant receptor countries such as Canada, Brazil, Australia, etc.[13][14]\n\n\nMost of these European immigrants settled in the cities which offered jobs, education and other opportunities enabling them to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system and since the 1930s many rural workers have moved to the big cities.[15]\n\n\nUrban areas reflect the influence of European immigration, and most of the larger ones feature boulevards and diagonal avenues inspired by the redevelopment of Paris. Argentine cities were originally built in a colonial Spanish grid style, centered on a plaza overlooked by a cathedral and important government buildings. Many still retain this general layout, known as a *damero*, meaning checkerboard, since it is based on a pattern of square blocks. The city of La Plata, designed at the end of the 19th century by Pedro Benoit, combines the checkerboard layout with added diagonal avenues at fixed intervals, and was the first in South America with electric street lighting.[16]\n\n\n\n### Provinces and districts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Flag\n | Province/District\n | Capital\n | Population (2022)[1] | Rank | Density (/km2)[1] | Avg. growth from 2010

in Argentina during the past century. Several sources were combined to compile the table.[19][20][21]\n\n\nThe number of births in 2021 (529,794) was 32% below the record set in 2014, while the number of deaths (436,799) was the highest ever recorded[2] - though as the population of Argentina showed a five-fold increase during the past century, the birth rate in 2021 (11.6) was a record low while the death rate (9.5) rose to its highest since 1947 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[2]\n\n\nBirth rates were relatively stable from 1934 through 1980,[19] and after declining stabilized from 1995 to 2015 - before again declining sharply since then.[21]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Average population\n | Live births\n | Deaths\n | Natural change\n | Crude birth rate(per 1000) | Crude death rate(per 1000) | Natural change(per 1000) | Total

Before the middle 19th century, the ethnic make up of Argentina was very similar to that of other countries of Latin America.[30][31][32][33] Between 1857 and 1950 Argentina was the country with the second biggest immigration wave in the world, at 6.6 million, second only to the United States in the numbers of immigrants received (27 million) and ahead of other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia.[34][35] However, mass European immigration did not have the same impact in the whole country. According to the 1914 national census, 30% of Argentina's population was foreign-born, including 50% of the people in the city of Buenos Aires, but foreigners were only 2% in the provinces of Catamarca and La Rioja (North West region).[31] Strikingly, at those times, the national population doubled every two decades. This belief is endured in the popular saying *\"los argentinos descienden de los barcos\"* (Argentines descend from the ships). Therefore, most Argentines are descended from the 19th- and 20th-century immigrants of the great European immigration wave to Argentina (1850–1955),[36] with a great majority of these immigrants coming from diverse European countries, particularly Italy and Spain.[13]\n\n\n\nCultural ethnic groups in the late 20th century in Argentina according to the UAEM[5]\n\n\n\nEuropean (85.0%)\nMestizo (11.4%)\nAsian and Arab (2.2%)\nAmerindian (1.0%)\nAfrican and Mulatto (0.4%)\n\nGenetic ancestry of the Argentine gene pool according to a study, using X-DIPs (matrilineal).[37]\n\n\n\nEuropean Contribution (52.9%)\nAmerindian Contribution (39.6%)\nAfrican Contribution (7.5%)\n\nGenetic ancestry of the mixed Argentines autosomal gene pool[37]\n\n\n\nEuropean Contribution (77.8%)\nAmerindian Contribution (17.9%)\nAfrican Contribution (4.2%)\n\nEthnic groupings in Argentina (2022 est.)[7]\n\n\n\nEuropean and Mestizo (97.2%)\nAmerindian (2.4%)\nAfrican (0.4%)\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Argentine Amerindians\n\n![](image)Distribution of the Indigenous Peoples in Argentina and The Falkland Islands (British Overseas Territory)\nAccording to the data of INDEC's Complementary Survey of Indigenous Peoples (ECPI) 2004–2005, 600,000 officially recognized indigenous persons (about 1.4% of the total population) reside in Argentina. The most numerous of these communities are the Mapuches, who live mostly in the south, the Kollas and Wichís, from the northwest, and the Guaranis and Qom, who live mostly in the northeast.[38]\nIn the census of 2010, 955,032 people self recognized as indigenous or descendants of indigenous peoples, thus representing 2.4% of the national population. This is without prejudice that more than half of the population has at least one indigenous ancestor, although in most cases family memory lost that origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Indigenous population of Argentina**\n| Ethnicgroup\n | Survey 2004–2005\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Number\n | %\n |\n| Aonikenk | 10,590 | 1.8\n |\n| Atacama | 3,044 | 0.5\n |\n| Avá-Guaraní | 21,807 | 3.6\n |\n| Aymara | 4,104 | 0.7\n |\n| Chané | 4,376 | 0.7\n |\n| Charrúa | 4,511 | 0.7\n |\n| Chorote | 2,613 | 0.4\n |\n| Chulupí | 553 | 0.1\n |\n| Comechingón | 10,863 | 1.8\n |\n| Diaguita/diaguita calchaquí | 31,753 | 5.3\n |\n| Guaraní | 22,059 | 3.7\n |\n| Het | 736 | 0.1\n |\n| Huarpe | 14,633 | 2.4\n |\n| Kolla | 70,505 | 11.7\n |\n| Lule | 854 | 0.1\n |\n| Mapuche | 113,680 | 18.8\n |\n| Mbyá | 8,223 | 1.4\n |\n| Mocoví | 15,837 | 2.6\n |\n| Omaguaca | 1,553 | 0.3\n |\n| Pilagá | 4,465 | 0.7\n |\n| Puelche | 1,585 | 0.3\n |\n| Qom | 69,452 | 11.5\n |\n| Quechua | 6,739 | 1.1\n |\n| Rankulche | 10,149 | 1.7\n |\n| Sanavirón | 563 | 0.1\n |\n| Selknam | 696 | 0.1\n |\n| Tapiete | 524 | 0.1\n |\n| Tonocoté | 4,779 | 0.8\n |\n| Wichí | 40,036 | 6.6\n |\n| Others | 3,864 | 0.6\n |\n| Not specified | 102,247 | 16.0\n |\n\n\n### Afro-Argentines[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Afro-Argentines\n\n![](image)Santiago Lovell, Argentine boxer and gold medalist at the 1932 Summer Olympics\nSince 2013, November 8 has been celebrated as the National Day of Afro-Argentines and African Culture. The date was chosen to commemorate the recorded date for the death of María Remedios del Valle, a *rabona* and guerrilla fighter, who served with the Army of the North in the war of Independence.[39][40]\n\n\nThe black population in Argentina declined since the middle 19th century from 15% of the total population in 1857 (Blacks and Mulatto people), to less than 0.5% at present (mainly mulattoes and immigrants from Cape Verde).\n\n\nAfro-Argentines were up to a third of the population during colonial times; most were slaves brought from Africa to work for the criollos. The 1813 Assembly abolished slavery and led to the Freedom of Wombs Law of 1813, which automatically freed slaves' children at birth. Many Afro-Argentines contributed to the independence of Argentina such as María Remedios del Valle who is known as \"La Madre de la Patria\" (mother of the fatherland in English) and Sgt. Juan Bautista Cabral. Also there is a debate, among the historians, as to whether or not Bernardino Rivadavia, the first president of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (Present Argentina) had African ancestors.[41]\n\n\n\n### Immigration to Argentina[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Argentina\n\n#### European settlement[edit]\n\n\nAs with other areas of new settlement such as Canada, Australia, the United States, Brazil, and New Zealand, Argentina is considered a country of immigrants.[42] When it is considered that Argentina was second only to the United States (27 million of immigrants) in the number of immigrants received, even ahead of such other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia;[34][35] and that the country was scarcely populated following its independence, the impact of the immigration to Argentina becomes evident.[34][35]\n\n\nIn the last national census, based on self-identification, 952,032 Argentines (2.4% of the population) declared to be Amerindians.[38] Most of the 6.2 million European immigrants arriving between 1850 and 1950, regardless of origin, settled in several regions of the country. Due to this large-scale European immigration, Argentina's population more than doubled.\n\n\n\n![](image)Immigrant population in Argentina (1869–1991)\nThe majority of these European immigrants came from Spain and Italy.\nThousands of immigrants also came from France, Germany, England, Portugal, Brazil, Switzerland, Wales, Scotland, Poland, Albania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Russia, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Bulgaria, Armenia, Greece, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia.\n\n\nItalian population in Argentina arrived mainly from the northern Italian regions varying between Piedmont, Veneto and Lombardy, later from Campania and Calabria;[43]\nSpanish immigrants were mainly Galicians and Basques.[44][45]\nThousands of immigrants also came from France (notably Béarn and the Northern Basque Country), Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Greece, Portugal, Finland, Russia and the United Kingdom.[46] The Welsh settlement in Patagonia, known as *Y Wladfa*, began in 1865; mainly along the coast of Chubut Province. In addition to the main colony in Chubut, a smaller colony was set up in Santa Fe and another group settled at Coronel Suárez, southern Buenos Aires Province.[47] Of the 50,000 Patagonians of Welsh descent, about 5,000 are Welsh speakers.[48] The community is centered on the cities of Gaiman, Trelew and Trevelin.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Recent immigrants[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Foreign born residents in Argentina by country of birth[50]\nAccording to the INDEC 1,531,940 of the Argentine resident population in 2001 were born outside Argentina, representing 4.22% of the total Argentine resident population.[51][52] In 2010, 1,805,957 of the Argentine resident population were born outside Argentina, representing 4.50% of the total Argentine resident population.[51][52][53][54]\n\n\nIllegal immigration has been a recent factor in Argentine demographics. Most illegal immigrants come from Bolivia and Paraguay, countries which border Argentina to the north. Smaller numbers arrive from Peru and Ecuador.\nThe Argentine government estimates that 750,000 inhabitants lack official documents and has launched a program called *Patria Grande* (\"Greater Homeland\")[55] to encourage illegal immigrants to regularize their status; so far over 670,000 applications have been processed under the program.[56]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank (2010) | Country of birth | Estimate 2023[57] | census 2010 | census 2001 | census 1990\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) Paraguay | 897,366 | 550,713 | 325,046 | 254,115\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Bolivia | 654,743 | 345,272 | 233,464 | 145,670\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Chile | 209,934 | 191,147 | 212,429 | 247,987\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Colombia | 110,974 | 177,000 | 50,250 | 15,939\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Peru | 285,163 | 157,514 | 88,260 | 15,939\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Italy | 88,671 | 147,499 | 216,718 | 356,923\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Uruguay |  | 116,592 | 117,564 | 135,406\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Spain | 70,674 | 94,030 | 134,417 | 244,212\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Brazil | 94,480 | 41,330 | 34,712 | 33,966\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) China |  | 8,929 | 4,184 | 2,297\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Germany |  | 8,416 | 10,362 | 15,451\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) South Korea |  | 7,321 | 8,290 | 8,371\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) France |  | 6,995 | 6,578 | 6,309\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Japan |  | 4,036 | 4,753 | 5,674\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Taiwan |  | 2,875 | 3,511 | 1,870\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Syria |  | 1,337 | 2,350 | N/D\n |\n| 16 | ![](image) Lebanon |  | 933 | 1,619 | 3,171\n |\n| 17 | ![](image) Venezuela | 217,742 |  |  |  |\n|  | Other countries | 249,669 | 121,018 | 127,683 | 150,849\n |\n| **TOTAL** | **3,007,251** | **1,805,957** | **1,531,940** | **1,628,210** |\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Argentina\n\nThe official language of Argentina is Spanish, and it is spoken by practically the entire population in several different accents. [*citation needed*] The most common variation of Spanish in Argentina is the **Rioplatense Spanish** (Spanish: *castellano rioplatense*), and it is so named because it evolved in the central areas around the Río de la Plata basin. Its distinctive feature is widespread voseo, the use of the pronoun *vos* instead of *tú* for the second person singular. Additionally, the Argentinian accent sounds identical to Portuguese in the words that begin with 'll' or 'yo', and all the words in Portuguese that begin with 'ch'. For example, the following sentence English: What is your name? Portuguese: como se chama? Spanish: Como se llama? - 'chama' & 'llama' are pronounced as though they were spelled \"Shama\"in both Argentinian Spanish and Portuguese. Moreover, the sound shift of all of the words in Spanish that begin with \"ll\" or 'y' but sound like 'sh' i.e., 'llorar' 'llama, 'llegar' & 'yo'. In Portuguese the words that begin with 'ch' always sound like 'sh'. There are many more words like these shown above. The mutual intelligibility between Spanish and Portuguese is already high, but the 'sh' sound increases the intelligibility between both languages even more.\n\n\n\n### Non-indigenous minority languages[edit]\n\n\nMany Argentines also speak other European languages (Italian, German, Portuguese, French, Welsh, Swedish and Croatian, as examples) due to the vast number of immigrants from Europe that came to Argentina.[7]\n\n\nEnglish language is a required subject in many schools, and there are also many private English-teaching academies and institutions. Young people have become accustomed to English through movies and the Internet, and knowledge of the language is also required in most jobs, so most middle-class children and teenagers now speak, read and/or understand it with various degrees of proficiency. According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines claim to speak some English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension).[8]\n\n\nThere are sources of around one million Levantine Arabic speakers in Argentina,[58] as a result of immigration from the Middle East, mostly from Syria and Lebanon.\n\n\nStandard German is spoken by around 500,000[58][59] Argentines of German ancestry, though the number may be as high as 3,800,000 according to some sources.[60] German is the third or fourth most spoken language in Argentina.\n\n\nThere is a prosperous community of Argentine Welsh-speakers of approximately 25,000[61] in the province of Chubut, in the Patagonia region, who descend from 19th century immigrants.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these template messages)*\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

The society, culture, and politics of Argentina are deeply imbued with Roman Catholicism.[63]\n\n\nEstimates for the number of Roman Catholics vary from 70% of the population,[64] to as much as 90%.[65] The CIA Factbook lists 92% of the country is Catholic, but only 20% are practicing regularly or weekly at a church service.[7] The Jewish population is about 300,000 (around 0.75% of the population), the community numbered about 400,000 after World War II, but the appeal of Israel and economic and cultural pressures at home led many to leave; recent instability in Israel has resulted in a modest reversal of the trend since 2003.[65][66] Muslim Argentines number about 500,000–600,000, or approximately 1.5% of the population; 93% of them are Sunni.[65] Buenos Aires is home to one of the largest mosques in Latin America. A study from 2010 found that approximately 11% of Argentines are non-religious, including those who believe in God, though not religion, agnostics (4%) and atheists (5%). Overall, 24% attended religious services regularly. Protestants were the only group in which a majority regularly attended services.[67]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Population distribution by province](image)\n\nPopulation distribution by province\n* ![Built in 1906 to welcome hundreds of newcomers daily, the Hotel de Inmigrantes is now a national museum.](image)\n\nBuilt in 1906 to welcome hundreds of newcomers daily, the Hotel de Inmigrantes is now a national museum.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina\n* Racism in Argentina\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Censo Nacional de Población, Hogares y Viviendas 2022\" (PDF). *INDEC*.

The population density is 16.5 persons per square kilometer - well below the world average of 62 persons. Argentina's population growth rate in 2020 was estimated to be 0.35% annually, with a birth rate of 11.8 per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 8.3 per 1,000 inhabitants.\n\n\nThe proportion of people under 15, at 23,5%, is slightly below the world average (25%), and the cohort of people 65 and older is relatively high, at 12.7%. The percentage of senior citizens in Argentina has long been second only to Uruguay in Latin America and well above the world average, which is currently 9.8%.\n\n\nThe median age is approximately 32 years and life expectancy at birth is of 78 years.[7] According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines speak English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension), 9.3% speak Portuguese[8] and 5.9% speak Italian.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Argentina by population\n\nArgentina is highly urbanized,[7] with the ten largest metropolitan areas accounting for half of the population, and fewer than one in ten living in rural areas. About 3 million people live in Buenos Aires proper, and including suburban Greater Buenos Aires the metropolitan area totals around 14 million - making it one of the 15 largest urban areas in the world.[10] The metropolitan areas of Córdoba and Rosario have around 1.3 million inhabitants each,[10] and six other cities (Mendoza, Tucumán, La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe)[10][11] have at least half a million people each.\n\n\nThe population is unequally distributed amongst the provinces, with 61% living in the Pampa region (21% of the total area), including 17.5 million people in Buenos Aires Province, 4 million in Córdoba Province, and over 3 million each in Santa Fe Province and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Eight other provinces each have over one million people: Mendoza, Tucumán, Salta, Entre Ríos, Misiones, Corrientes, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero. Tucumán is the most densely populated (with 75 inhabitants/km2, the only Argentine province more densely populated than the world average), while the southern province of Santa Cruz has just 1.4 inhabitant/km2.[12]\n\n\nIn the mid-19th century, a large wave of immigration started to arrive to Argentina due to new constitutional policies that encouraged immigration, and issues in the countries the immigrants came from such as wars, poverty, hunger, famines, pursuit of a better life, among other reasons. The main immigration sources were from Europe, the countries from the Near and Middle East, Russia and Japan. In fact, the immigration torrent was so strong that Argentina eventually received the second-largest number of immigrants in the world, second only to the US and ahead of such immigrant receptor countries such as Canada, Brazil, Australia, etc.[13][14]\n\n\nMost of these European immigrants settled in the cities which offered jobs, education and other opportunities enabling them to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system and since the 1930s many rural workers have moved to the big cities.[15]\n\n\nUrban areas reflect the influence of European immigration, and most of the larger ones feature boulevards and diagonal avenues inspired by the redevelopment of Paris. Argentine cities were originally built in a colonial Spanish grid style, centered on a plaza overlooked by a cathedral and important government buildings. Many still retain this general layout, known as a *damero*, meaning checkerboard, since it is based on a pattern of square blocks. The city of La Plata, designed at the end of the 19th century by Pedro Benoit, combines the checkerboard layout with added diagonal avenues at fixed intervals, and was the first in South America with electric street lighting.[16]\n\n\n\n### Provinces and districts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Flag\n | Province/District\n | Capital\n | Population (2022)[1] | Rank | Density (/km2)[1] | Avg. growth from 2010

in Argentina during the past century. Several sources were combined to compile the table.[19][20][21]\n\n\nThe number of births in 2021 (529,794) was 32% below the record set in 2014, while the number of deaths (436,799) was the highest ever recorded[2] - though as the population of Argentina showed a five-fold increase during the past century, the birth rate in 2021 (11.6) was a record low while the death rate (9.5) rose to its highest since 1947 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[2]\n\n\nBirth rates were relatively stable from 1934 through 1980,[19] and after declining stabilized from 1995 to 2015 - before again declining sharply since then.[21]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Average population\n | Live births\n | Deaths\n | Natural change\n | Crude birth rate(per 1000) | Crude death rate(per 1000) | Natural change(per 1000) | Total

Before the middle 19th century, the ethnic make up of Argentina was very similar to that of other countries of Latin America.[30][31][32][33] Between 1857 and 1950 Argentina was the country with the second biggest immigration wave in the world, at 6.6 million, second only to the United States in the numbers of immigrants received (27 million) and ahead of other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia.[34][35] However, mass European immigration did not have the same impact in the whole country. According to the 1914 national census, 30% of Argentina's population was foreign-born, including 50% of the people in the city of Buenos Aires, but foreigners were only 2% in the provinces of Catamarca and La Rioja (North West region).[31] Strikingly, at those times, the national population doubled every two decades. This belief is endured in the popular saying *\"los argentinos descienden de los barcos\"* (Argentines descend from the ships). Therefore, most Argentines are descended from the 19th- and 20th-century immigrants of the great European immigration wave to Argentina (1850–1955),[36] with a great majority of these immigrants coming from diverse European countries, particularly Italy and Spain.[13]\n\n\n\nCultural ethnic groups in the late 20th century in Argentina according to the UAEM[5]\n\n\n\nEuropean (85.0%)\nMestizo (11.4%)\nAsian and Arab (2.2%)\nAmerindian (1.0%)\nAfrican and Mulatto (0.4%)\n\nGenetic ancestry of the Argentine gene pool according to a study, using X-DIPs (matrilineal).[37]\n\n\n\nEuropean Contribution (52.9%)\nAmerindian Contribution (39.6%)\nAfrican Contribution (7.5%)\n\nGenetic ancestry of the mixed Argentines autosomal gene pool[37]\n\n\n\nEuropean Contribution (77.8%)\nAmerindian Contribution (17.9%)\nAfrican Contribution (4.2%)\n\nEthnic groupings in Argentina (2022 est.)[7]\n\n\n\nEuropean and Mestizo (97.2%)\nAmerindian (2.4%)\nAfrican (0.4%)\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Argentine Amerindians\n\n![](image)Distribution of the Indigenous Peoples in Argentina and The Falkland Islands (British Overseas Territory)\nAccording to the data of INDEC's Complementary Survey of Indigenous Peoples (ECPI) 2004–2005, 600,000 officially recognized indigenous persons (about 1.4% of the total population) reside in Argentina. The most numerous of these communities are the Mapuches, who live mostly in the south, the Kollas and Wichís, from the northwest, and the Guaranis and Qom, who live mostly in the northeast.[38]\nIn the census of 2010, 955,032 people self recognized as indigenous or descendants of indigenous peoples, thus representing 2.4% of the national population. This is without prejudice that more than half of the population has at least one indigenous ancestor, although in most cases family memory lost that origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Indigenous population of Argentina**\n| Ethnicgroup\n | Survey 2004–2005\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Number\n | %\n |\n| Aonikenk | 10,590 | 1.8\n |\n| Atacama | 3,044 | 0.5\n |\n| Avá-Guaraní | 21,807 | 3.6\n |\n| Aymara | 4,104 | 0.7\n |\n| Chané | 4,376 | 0.7\n |\n| Charrúa | 4,511 | 0.7\n |\n| Chorote | 2,613 | 0.4\n |\n| Chulupí | 553 | 0.1\n |\n| Comechingón | 10,863 | 1.8\n |\n| Diaguita/diaguita calchaquí | 31,753 | 5.3\n |\n| Guaraní | 22,059 | 3.7\n |\n| Het | 736 | 0.1\n |\n| Huarpe | 14,633 | 2.4\n |\n| Kolla | 70,505 | 11.7\n |\n| Lule | 854 | 0.1\n |\n| Mapuche | 113,680 | 18.8\n |\n| Mbyá | 8,223 | 1.4\n |\n| Mocoví | 15,837 | 2.6\n |\n| Omaguaca | 1,553 | 0.3\n |\n| Pilagá | 4,465 | 0.7\n |\n| Puelche | 1,585 | 0.3\n |\n| Qom | 69,452 | 11.5\n |\n| Quechua | 6,739 | 1.1\n |\n| Rankulche | 10,149 | 1.7\n |\n| Sanavirón | 563 | 0.1\n |\n| Selknam | 696 | 0.1\n |\n| Tapiete | 524 | 0.1\n |\n| Tonocoté | 4,779 | 0.8\n |\n| Wichí | 40,036 | 6.6\n |\n| Others | 3,864 | 0.6\n |\n| Not specified | 102,247 | 16.0\n |\n\n\n### Afro-Argentines[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Afro-Argentines\n\n![](image)Santiago Lovell, Argentine boxer and gold medalist at the 1932 Summer Olympics\nSince 2013, November 8 has been celebrated as the National Day of Afro-Argentines and African Culture. The date was chosen to commemorate the recorded date for the death of María Remedios del Valle, a *rabona* and guerrilla fighter, who served with the Army of the North in the war of Independence.[39][40]\n\n\nThe black population in Argentina declined since the middle 19th century from 15% of the total population in 1857 (Blacks and Mulatto people), to less than 0.5% at present (mainly mulattoes and immigrants from Cape Verde).\n\n\nAfro-Argentines were up to a third of the population during colonial times; most were slaves brought from Africa to work for the criollos. The 1813 Assembly abolished slavery and led to the Freedom of Wombs Law of 1813, which automatically freed slaves' children at birth. Many Afro-Argentines contributed to the independence of Argentina such as María Remedios del Valle who is known as \"La Madre de la Patria\" (mother of the fatherland in English) and Sgt. Juan Bautista Cabral. Also there is a debate, among the historians, as to whether or not Bernardino Rivadavia, the first president of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (Present Argentina) had African ancestors.[41]\n\n\n\n### Immigration to Argentina[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Argentina\n\n#### European settlement[edit]\n\n\nAs with other areas of new settlement such as Canada, Australia, the United States, Brazil, and New Zealand, Argentina is considered a country of immigrants.[42] When it is considered that Argentina was second only to the United States (27 million of immigrants) in the number of immigrants received, even ahead of such other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia;[34][35] and that the country was scarcely populated following its independence, the impact of the immigration to Argentina becomes evident.[34][35]\n\n\nIn the last national census, based on self-identification, 952,032 Argentines (2.4% of the population) declared to be Amerindians.[38] Most of the 6.2 million European immigrants arriving between 1850 and 1950, regardless of origin, settled in several regions of the country. Due to this large-scale European immigration, Argentina's population more than doubled.\n\n\n\n![](image)Immigrant population in Argentina (1869–1991)\nThe majority of these European immigrants came from Spain and Italy.\nThousands of immigrants also came from France, Germany, England, Portugal, Brazil, Switzerland, Wales, Scotland, Poland, Albania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Russia, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Bulgaria, Armenia, Greece, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia.\n\n\nItalian population in Argentina arrived mainly from the northern Italian regions varying between Piedmont, Veneto and Lombardy, later from Campania and Calabria;[43]\nSpanish immigrants were mainly Galicians and Basques.[44][45]\nThousands of immigrants also came from France (notably Béarn and the Northern Basque Country), Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Greece, Portugal, Finland, Russia and the United Kingdom.[46] The Welsh settlement in Patagonia, known as *Y Wladfa*, began in 1865; mainly along the coast of Chubut Province. In addition to the main colony in Chubut, a smaller colony was set up in Santa Fe and another group settled at Coronel Suárez, southern Buenos Aires Province.[47] Of the 50,000 Patagonians of Welsh descent, about 5,000 are Welsh speakers.[48] The community is centered on the cities of Gaiman, Trelew and Trevelin.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Recent immigrants[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Foreign born residents in Argentina by country of birth[50]\nAccording to the INDEC 1,531,940 of the Argentine resident population in 2001 were born outside Argentina, representing 4.22% of the total Argentine resident population.[51][52] In 2010, 1,805,957 of the Argentine resident population were born outside Argentina, representing 4.50% of the total Argentine resident population.[51][52][53][54]\n\n\nIllegal immigration has been a recent factor in Argentine demographics. Most illegal immigrants come from Bolivia and Paraguay, countries which border Argentina to the north. Smaller numbers arrive from Peru and Ecuador.\nThe Argentine government estimates that 750,000 inhabitants lack official documents and has launched a program called *Patria Grande* (\"Greater Homeland\")[55] to encourage illegal immigrants to regularize their status; so far over 670,000 applications have been processed under the program.[56]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank (2010) | Country of birth | Estimate 2023[57] | census 2010 | census 2001 | census 1990\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) Paraguay | 897,366 | 550,713 | 325,046 | 254,115\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Bolivia | 654,743 | 345,272 | 233,464 | 145,670\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Chile | 209,934 | 191,147 | 212,429 | 247,987\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Colombia | 110,974 | 177,000 | 50,250 | 15,939\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Peru | 285,163 | 157,514 | 88,260 | 15,939\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Italy | 88,671 | 147,499 | 216,718 | 356,923\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Uruguay |  | 116,592 | 117,564 | 135,406\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Spain | 70,674 | 94,030 | 134,417 | 244,212\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Brazil | 94,480 | 41,330 | 34,712 | 33,966\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) China |  | 8,929 | 4,184 | 2,297\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Germany |  | 8,416 | 10,362 | 15,451\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) South Korea |  | 7,321 | 8,290 | 8,371\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) France |  | 6,995 | 6,578 | 6,309\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Japan |  | 4,036 | 4,753 | 5,674\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Taiwan |  | 2,875 | 3,511 | 1,870\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Syria |  | 1,337 | 2,350 | N/D\n |\n| 16 | ![](image) Lebanon |  | 933 | 1,619 | 3,171\n |\n| 17 | ![](image) Venezuela | 217,742 |  |  |  |\n|  | Other countries | 249,669 | 121,018 | 127,683 | 150,849\n |\n| **TOTAL** | **3,007,251** | **1,805,957** | **1,531,940** | **1,628,210** |\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Argentina\n\nThe official language of Argentina is Spanish, and it is spoken by practically the entire population in several different accents. [*citation needed*] The most common variation of Spanish in Argentina is the **Rioplatense Spanish** (Spanish: *castellano rioplatense*), and it is so named because it evolved in the central areas around the Río de la Plata basin. Its distinctive feature is widespread voseo, the use of the pronoun *vos* instead of *tú* for the second person singular. Additionally, the Argentinian accent sounds identical to Portuguese in the words that begin with 'll' or 'yo', and all the words in Portuguese that begin with 'ch'. For example, the following sentence English: What is your name? Portuguese: como se chama? Spanish: Como se llama? - 'chama' & 'llama' are pronounced as though they were spelled \"Shama\"in both Argentinian Spanish and Portuguese. Moreover, the sound shift of all of the words in Spanish that begin with \"ll\" or 'y' but sound like 'sh' i.e., 'llorar' 'llama, 'llegar' & 'yo'. In Portuguese the words that begin with 'ch' always sound like 'sh'. There are many more words like these shown above. The mutual intelligibility between Spanish and Portuguese is already high, but the 'sh' sound increases the intelligibility between both languages even more.\n\n\n\n### Non-indigenous minority languages[edit]\n\n\nMany Argentines also speak other European languages (Italian, German, Portuguese, French, Welsh, Swedish and Croatian, as examples) due to the vast number of immigrants from Europe that came to Argentina.[7]\n\n\nEnglish language is a required subject in many schools, and there are also many private English-teaching academies and institutions. Young people have become accustomed to English through movies and the Internet, and knowledge of the language is also required in most jobs, so most middle-class children and teenagers now speak, read and/or understand it with various degrees of proficiency. According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines claim to speak some English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension).[8]\n\n\nThere are sources of around one million Levantine Arabic speakers in Argentina,[58] as a result of immigration from the Middle East, mostly from Syria and Lebanon.\n\n\nStandard German is spoken by around 500,000[58][59] Argentines of German ancestry, though the number may be as high as 3,800,000 according to some sources.[60] German is the third or fourth most spoken language in Argentina.\n\n\nThere is a prosperous community of Argentine Welsh-speakers of approximately 25,000[61] in the province of Chubut, in the Patagonia region, who descend from 19th century immigrants.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these template messages)*\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

The society, culture, and politics of Argentina are deeply imbued with Roman Catholicism.[63]\n\n\nEstimates for the number of Roman Catholics vary from 70% of the population,[64] to as much as 90%.[65] The CIA Factbook lists 92% of the country is Catholic, but only 20% are practicing regularly or weekly at a church service.[7] The Jewish population is about 300,000 (around 0.75% of the population), the community numbered about 400,000 after World War II, but the appeal of Israel and economic and cultural pressures at home led many to leave; recent instability in Israel has resulted in a modest reversal of the trend since 2003.[65][66] Muslim Argentines number about 500,000–600,000, or approximately 1.5% of the population; 93% of them are Sunni.[65] Buenos Aires is home to one of the largest mosques in Latin America. A study from 2010 found that approximately 11% of Argentines are non-religious, including those who believe in God, though not religion, agnostics (4%) and atheists (5%). Overall, 24% attended religious services regularly. Protestants were the only group in which a majority regularly attended services.[67]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Population distribution by province](image)\n\nPopulation distribution by province\n* ![Built in 1906 to welcome hundreds of newcomers daily, the Hotel de Inmigrantes is now a national museum.](image)\n\nBuilt in 1906 to welcome hundreds of newcomers daily, the Hotel de Inmigrantes is now a national museum.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina\n* Racism in Argentina\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Censo Nacional de Población, Hogares y Viviendas 2022\" (PDF). *INDEC*.
