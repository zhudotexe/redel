It marked the second time the Summer Olympics were held in Australia, and in the Southern Hemisphere, the first being in Melbourne, in 1956.\n\n\nSydney was selected as the host city for the 2000 Games in 1993. Teams from 199 countries participated in the 2000 Games, which were the first to feature at least 300 events in its official sports program. The Games' cost was estimated to be A$6.6 billion. These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch before the arrival of his successor Jacques Rogge. The 2000 Games were the last of the two consecutive Summer Olympics to be held in a predominantly English-speaking country following the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States.\n\n\nThe final medal tally at the 2000 Summer Olympics was led by the United States, followed by Russia and China with host Australia in fourth place overall. Cameroon, Colombia, Latvia, Mozambique, and Slovenia won a gold medal for the first time in their Olympic histories, while Barbados, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, North Macedonia, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam won their first-ever Olympic medals. Australia will host the Summer Olympics again in 2032 at Brisbane, Queensland making it the first Oceanic country to host the Olympics three times.\n\n\nThe 2000 Games received universal acclaim, with the organization, volunteers, sportsmanship, and Australian public being lauded in the international media. Bill Bryson of *The Times* called the Sydney Games \"one of the most successful events on the world stage\", saying that they \"couldn't be better\".[3] James Mossop of the *Electronic Telegraph* called the Games \"such a success that any city considering bidding for future Olympics must be wondering how it can reach the standards set by Sydney\",[4] while Jack Todd of the *Montreal Gazette* suggested that the \"IOC should quit while it's ahead. Admit there can never be a better Olympic Games, and be done with it,\" as \"Sydney was both exceptional and the best\".[3] These games would provide the inspiration for London's winning bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in 2005; in preparing for the 2012 Games, Lord Coe declared the 2000 Games the \"benchmark for the spirit of the Games, unquestionably\", admitting that the London organizing committee \"attempted in several ways to emulate what the Sydney Organising Committee did.\"[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Host city selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2000 Summer Olympics\n\nSydney won the right to host the Games on 24 September 1993, after being selected over Beijing, Berlin, Istanbul, and Manchester in four rounds of voting, at the 101st IOC Session in Monte Carlo, Monaco. The Australian city of Melbourne which also hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics had lost out to Atlanta for the 1996 Summer Olympics three years earlier.[6] Beijing would later be selected to host the 2008 Summer Olympics eight years later on 13 July 2001 and the 2022 Winter Olympics twenty-two years later on 31 July 2015. Beijing's loss to Sydney was seen as a \"significant blow\" to an \"urgent political priority\" of the Chinese Communist Party leadership having mounted the most intense and expensive candidacy campaign at the date so far (this includes the Summer and Winter Games). Although it is unknown as two members of the International Olympic Committee voted for Sydney over Beijing in 1993, it appears that an important role was played by Human Rights Watch's campaign to \"stop Beijing\" because of China's human rights record and international isolation following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.[7] Many in China were angry at what they saw as U.S.-led interference in the vote, and the outcome contributed to rising anti-Western sentiment in China and a new phase in the tensions in Sino-American relations.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n2000 Summer Olympics bidding results[9]\n| City\n | NOC Name\n | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** | **Round 4** |\n| Sydney | ![](image) Australia | 30 | 30 | 37 | **45** |\n| Beijing | ![](image) China | **32** | **37** | **40** | 43\n |\n| Manchester | ![](image) Great Britain | 11 | 13 | 11 | —\n |\n| Berlin | ![](image) Germany | 9 | 9 | — | —\n |\n| Istanbul | ![](image) Turkey | 7 | — | — | —\n |\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Costs[edit]\n\n\nThe *Oxford Olympics Study 2016* estimates the outturn cost of the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics at US$5 billion in 2015 dollars and cost overrun at 90% in real terms.[10] This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) *operational costs* incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) *direct capital costs* incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are *not* included, such as for road, rail, airport infrastructure, hotel upgrades, or other business investments incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The cost for Sydney 2000 compares with a cost of US$4.6 billion for Rio 2016, US$40–44 billion for Beijing 2008, and US$51 billion for Sochi 2014, the most expensive Olympics in history. The average cost for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion, average cost overrun is 176%.\n\n\nIn 2000, the Auditor-General of New South Wales reported that the Sydney Games cost A$6.6 billion, with a net cost to the public between A$1.7 and A$2.4 billion.[11][12] In the years leading up to the games, funds were shifted from education and health programs to cover Olympic expenses.[13]\n\n\nIt has been estimated that the economic impact of the 2000 Olympics was that A$2.1 billion has been shaved from public consumption. Economic growth was not stimulated to a net benefit and in the years after 2000, foreign tourism to NSW grew by less than tourism to Australia as a whole. A \"multiplier\" effect on broader economic development was not realized, as a simple \"multiplier\" analysis fails to capture that resources have to be redirected from elsewhere: the building of a stadium is at the expense of other public works such as extensions to hospitals. Building sporting venues does not add to the aggregate stock of productive capital in the years following the Games: \"Equestrian centers, softball compounds, and man-made rapids are not particularly useful beyond their immediate function.\"[14]\n\n\nMany venues that were constructed in Sydney Olympic Park failed financially in the years immediately following the Olympics to meet the expected bookings to meet upkeep expenses. It was only the 2003 Rugby World Cup that reconnected the park back to citizens.[15] In recent years, infrastructure costs for some facilities have been of growing concern to the NSW Government, especially facilities in Western Sydney.[15] Proposed metro and light rail links from Olympic Park to Parramatta have been estimated to cost in the same order of magnitude as the public expenditure on the games.[16][*citation needed*] Stadium Australia had been considered for demolition in 2017 by then NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, citing that the stadium was \"built for an Olympics\" but not for modern spectators.[17] The plan was scrapped in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.[18] The Dunc Gray Velodrome has also struggled to keep up its $500,000 per year maintenance costs,[16] although it is still used for track cycling events.[19]\n\n\n\n### Chronological Summary of the 2000 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nAlthough the Opening Ceremony was not scheduled until 15 September, the football competitions began with preliminary matches on 13 September. Among the pre-ceremony fixtures, host nation Australia lost 1–0 to Italy at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which was the main stadium for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.\n\n\n\n#### Day 1: 15 September[edit]\n\n\n##### Cultural display highlights[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n\n![](image)The 2000 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony at Stadium Australia, on 15 September 2000.\nThe opening ceremony began with a tribute to the Australian pastoral heritage of the Australian stockmen and the importance of the stock horse in Australia's heritage. It was produced and filmed by the Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation and the home nation broadcaster Channel 7.[20] This was introduced by lone rider Steve Jefferys and his rearing Australian Stock Horse *Ammo*. At the cracking of Jefferys' stockwhip, a further 120 riders entered the stadium, their stock horses performing intricate steps, including forming the five Olympic Rings, to a Special Olympics version of the theme, which Bruce Rowland had previously composed for the 1982 film *The Man from Snowy River*.\n\n\nThe Australian National Anthem was sung in the first verse by Human Nature and the second by Julie Anthony.\n\n\nThe ceremony continued, showing many aspects of the land and its people: the affinity of the mainly coastal-dwelling Australians with the sea that surrounds the \"Island Continent\". The indigenous occupation of the land, the coming of the First Fleet, the continued immigration from many nations, and the rural industry on which the economy of the nation was built, including a display representing the harshness of rural life based on the paintings of Sir Sidney Nolan. Two memorable scenes were the representation of the \"Heart\" of the country by 200 Aboriginal women from Central Australia who danced up \"the mighty spirit of God to protect the Games\" and the overwhelmingly noisy representation of the construction industry by hundreds of tap-dancing teenagers.\n\n\nBecause Bibi Salisachs (the wife of IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch) was seriously ill and unable to accompany her husband to the Olympics, Dawn Fraser, former Australian Olympic Champion swimmer and member of the Parliament of New South Wales, accompanied Samaranch during the Australian cultural display, explaining to him some of the cultural references that are unfamiliar to non-Australians.\n\n\n\n##### Formal presentation[edit]\n\n\nA record 199 nations entered the stadium, with a record 80 of them winning at least one medal. The only missing IOC member was Afghanistan, who was banned due to the extremist rule of the Taliban's oppression of women and its prohibition of sports.[21] The ceremony featured a unified entrance by the athletes of North and South Korea,[b] using a specially designed unification flag: a white background flag with a blue map of the Korean Peninsula. Four athletes from East Timor also marched in the parade of nations as individual Olympic athletes and marched directly before the host country. Although the country-to-be had no National Olympic Committee then, they were allowed to compete under the Olympic Flag with country code IOA. The Governor-General, Sir William Deane, opened the games.\n\n\nThe Olympic Flag was carried around the arena by eight former Australian Olympic champions: Bill Roycroft, Murray Rose, Liane Tooth, Gillian Rolton, Marjorie Jackson, Lorraine Crapp, Michael Wenden and Nick Green. During the raising of the Olympics Flag, the Olympic Hymn was sung by the Millennium Choir of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia in Greek. Following this, Tina Arena sang a purpose-written pop song, *The Flame*.[22]\n\n\nThe opening ceremony concluded with the lighting of the Olympic Flame, which was brought into the stadium by former Australian Olympic champion Herb Elliott. Then, celebrating 100 years of women's participation in the Olympic Games, former Australian women Olympic medalists Betty Cuthbert and Raelene Boyle, Dawn Fraser, Shirley Strickland (later Shirley Strickland de la Hunty), Shane Gould and Debbie Flintoff-King brought the torch through the stadium, handing it over to Cathy Freeman, who lit the flame in the cauldron within a circle of fire. The choice of Freeman, an Aboriginal woman, to light the flame was notable given the history of human rights abuses against Aboriginal people in Australia.[23] Following her lighting, Freeman was the subject of racial abuse from some Australians.[24] The planned spectacular climax to the ceremony was delayed by the technical glitch of a computer switch which malfunctioned, causing the sequence to shut down by giving a false reading. This meant that the Olympic flame was suspended in mid-air for about four minutes rather than immediately rising up a water-covered ramp to the top of the stadium. When the cause of the problem was discovered, the program was overridden and the cauldron continued its course, and the ceremony concluded with a fireworks display.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Day 2: 16 September[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gold medallist Nancy Johnson (centre) of the U.S., raises her hands with silver medallist Kang Cho-hyun (left), of South Korea, and bronze winner Gao Jing (right), of China, during the first medal ceremony of the 2000 Olympic Games.\nThe first medals of the Games were awarded in the women's 10 metre air rifle competition, which was won by Nancy Johnson of the United States.\n\n\nThe Triathlon made its Olympic debut with the women's race. Set in the surroundings of the Sydney Opera House, Brigitte McMahon representing Switzerland swam, cycled and ran to the first gold medal in the sport, beating the favoured home athletes such as Michelie Jones who won silver. McMahon only passed Jones in sight of the finish line.\n\n\nThe first star of the Games was 17-year-old Australian Ian Thorpe, who first set a new world record in the 400-metre freestyle final before competing in an exciting 4 × 100 m freestyle final. Swimming the last leg, Thorpe passed the leading American team and arrived in a new world record time, two-tenths of a second ahead of the Americans. In the same event for women, the Americans also broke the world record, finishing ahead of the Netherlands and Sweden.\n\n\nSamaranch had to leave for home, as his wife was severely ill. Upon arrival, his wife had already died. Samaranch returned to Sydney four days later. The Olympic flag was flown at half-staff during the period as a sign of respect to Samaranch's wife.\n\n\n\n#### Day 3: 17 September[edit]\n\n\nCanadian Simon Whitfield sprinted away in the last 100 metres of the men's triathlon, becoming the inaugural winner in the event.\n\n\nOn the cycling track, Robert Bartko beat fellow German Jens Lehmann in the individual pursuit, setting a new Olympic Record. Leontien Zijlaard-van Moorsel set a world record in the semi-finals the same event for women.\n\n\nIn the swimming pool, American Tom Dolan beat the world record in the 400-metre medley, successfully defending the title he won in Atlanta four years prior. Dutchwoman Inge de Bruijn also clocked a new world record, beating her own time in the 100 m butterfly final to win by more than a second.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n#### Day 4: 18 September[edit]\n\n\nThe main event for the Australians on the fourth day of the Games was the 200 m freestyle. Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband had broken the world record in the semi-finals, taking it from the new Australian hero Ian Thorpe, who came close to the world record in his semi-final heat. As the final race finished, Van den Hoogenband's time was exactly the same as in the semi-finals, finishing ahead of Thorpe by half a second.\n\n\nChina won the gold medal in the men's team all-around gymnastics competition after being the runner-up in the previous two Olympics. The other medals were taken by Ukraine and Russia, respectively.\n\n\nZijlaard-van Moorsel lived up to the expectations set by her world record in cycling in the semis by winning the gold medal.\n\n\n\n#### Day 7: 21 September[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Women's Gymnastics All-Around, female athletes suffered damning scores and injuries due to improperly installed gymnastics equipment. Gymnasts performing on the vault gave uncharacteristically poor performances and fell. Officials blamed the series of falls and low scores on performance anxiety. It wasn't until Australian gymnast Allana Slater and her coach, Peggy Liddick, voiced concerns about the equipment that officials discovered the apparatus was five centimetres, or almost two inches, lower than it should've been. While athletes were given the opportunity to perform again, for some of them, the damage to their mental or physical health caused by the vault was irreparable. Chinese gymnast Kui Yuanyuan and American gymnast Kristen Maloney both injured their legs while attempting to stick their landings, with Kui needing to be carried to an examination area and Maloney damaging a titanium rod that had recently been implanted in her shin. Romanian gymnast Andreea Răducan ultimately took gold while her teammates, Simona Amânar and Maria Olaru took silver and bronze, respectively.\n\n\n\n#### Day 9: 23 September[edit]\n\n\nBy rowing in the winning coxless four, Steve Redgrave of Great Britain became a member of a select group who had won gold medals at five consecutive Olympics.\n\n\nThe swimming 4 x 100-metre medley relay of B.J. Bedford, Megan Quann (Jendrick), Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres became the first women's relay under 4-minutes, swimming 3:58 and setting a world record, claiming the gold medal for the United States.\n\n\n\n#### Day 10: 24 September[edit]\n\n\nRulon Gardner, never an NCAA champion or a world medalist, beat Alexander Karelin of Russia to win gold in the super heavyweight class, Greco-Roman wrestling. Karelin had won gold in Seoul, Barcelona and Atlanta. Before this fight, he had never lost in international competition, had been unbeaten in all competitions in 13 years, and had not surrendered a point in a decade.\n\n\n\n#### Day 11: 25 September[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cathy Freeman after the 400-metre final\nAustralian Cathy Freeman won the 400-metre final in front of a jubilant Sydney crowd at the Olympic Stadium, ahead of Lorraine Graham of Jamaica and Katharine Merry of Great Britain. Freeman's win made her the first competitor in Olympic Games history to light the Olympic Flame and then go on to win a Gold Medal. The attendance at the stadium was 112,524 – the largest attendance for any sport in Olympic Games history.\n\n\nIn a men's basketball pool match between the United States and France, the USA's Vince Carter made one of the most famous dunks in basketball history. After getting the ball off a steal, the 6'6\"/1.98 m Carter drove to the basket, with 7'2\"/2.18 m centre Frédéric Weis in his way. Carter jumped, spread his legs in midair, scraped Weis' head on the way up, and dunked. The French media dubbed the feat *le dunk de la mort* (\"the dunk of death\").\n\n\n\n#### Day 14: 28 September[edit]\n\n\nThe Canadian flag at the athletes' village was lowered to half-mast as Canadian athletes paid tribute to the former prime minister Pierre Trudeau after hearing of his death in Montreal (because of the time zone difference, it was 29 September in Sydney when Trudeau died). The Canadian flag was flown at half-mast for the remainder of the Olympics, on orders from both IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy, as the state funeral did not take place until 3 October, two days after the closing ceremony, and the Canadian athletes subsequently rushed back to attend his funeral after 1 October. \n\n\n\n#### Day 16: 30 September[edit]\n\n\nCameroon won a historic gold medal over Spain in the Men's Olympic Football Final at the Olympic Stadium. The game went to a penalty shootout, which was won by Cameroon 5–3.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Day 17: 1 October[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony\n\n![](image)Olympic colours on the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\nThe last event of the games was the Men's Marathon, contested on a course that started in North Sydney. The event was won by Ethiopian Gezahegne Abera, with Kenyan Erick Wainaina second, and Tesfaye Tola, also of Ethiopia, third. It was the first time since the 1968 Olympics that an Ethiopian won the gold medal in this event.\n\n\nThe closing ceremony commenced with Christine Anu performing her version of the Warumpi Band's song \"My Island Home\", with several Aboriginal dancers atop the Geodome Stage in the middle of the stadium, around which several hundred umbrella and lamp box kids created an image of Aboriginal Dreamtime. The Geodome Stage was used throughout the ceremony, which was a flat stage mechanically raised into the shape of a Geode.\n\n\nIOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch declared at the Closing Ceremony,[27]\n\n\n\n\n> \"I am proud and happy to proclaim that you have presented to the world the best Olympic Games ever.\"\n> \n> \n\n\nSubsequent Summer Olympics held in Athens, Beijing and London have been described by Samaranch's successor Jacques Rogge as \"unforgettable, dream Games\", \"truly exceptional\" and \"happy and glorious games\" respectively – the practice of declaring games the \"best ever\" having been retired after the 2000 Games.\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe 2000 Summer Olympic programme featured 300 events in the following 28 sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2000

featured wheelchair racing as exhibition events on the athletics schedule.[28]\n\n\nSpecial quarantine conditions were introduced to allow entry of horses into Australia to participate in equestrian events,[29] avoiding the need for such events to take place elsewhere as had happened at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\n*All dates are in AEDST (UTC+11); the other two cities, Adelaide uses ACST (UTC+9:30) and Brisbane uses AEST (UTC+10)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **OC** | Opening ceremony\n | ● |

Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Participating countries\n![](image)Number of athletes\n199 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in the Sydney Games, two more than in the 1996 Summer Olympics; in addition, there were four Timorese Individual Olympic Athletes at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Eritrea, the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau made their Olympic debut this year.\n\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo was once again designated under that name, after it participated as Zaire from 1984 to 1996.\n\n\nAfghanistan was the only 1996 participant (and the only existing NOC) that did not participate in the 2000 Olympics, having been banned due to the Taliban's totalitarian rule in Afghanistan, their oppression of women, and its prohibition of sports.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Participating National Olympic Committees |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image) Albania (4 athletes)\n*

organisational structure circa 1998 – five groups and 33 divisions reporting to the CEO are organised primarily along functional lines with only a limited number of divisions (e.g. Interstate Football and Villages) anticipating a venue focussed design.\n![](image)SOCOG organisational structure circa 1999 – functional divisions and precinct/venue streams are organised in a matrix structure linked to the Main Operations Centre (MOC). Some functions such as Project Management (in the Games Coordination group) continue to exist largely outside this matrix structure.\n### Organisations responsible for the Olympics[edit]\n\n\nA number of quasi-government bodies were responsible for the construction, organisation and execution of the Sydney Games. These included:\n\n\n\n* the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) and the Sydney Paralympic Organizing Committee (SPOC), primarily responsibles for the staging of the Games\n* Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA), primarily responsible for construction and oversight\n* Olympic Roads & Transport Authority (ORTA)\n* Olympic Security Command Centre (OSCC)\n* Olympic Intelligence Centre (OIC)\n* JTF Gold the Australian Defence Force Joint Taskforce Gold\n* Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation (nominally part of SOCOG)\n* IBM, provider of technology and the Technical Command Centre\n* Telstra, provider of telecommunications\n* Great Big Events, event management and marketing\n\n\nThese organisations worked closely together and with other bodies such as:\n\n\n\n* the International Olympic Committee (IOC)\n* the International Paralympic Committee (IPC)\n* the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC)\n* the Australian Paralympic Committee (APC)\n* the other 197 National Olympic Committees (NOCs)\n* the other 125 National Paralympic Committees (NPCs)\n* the 33 International Sports Federations (IFs)\n* all three levels of Australian government (federal, state and local)\n* dozens of official sponsor and hundreds of official supplier companies\n\n\nThese bodies are often collectively referred to as the \"Olympic Family\".\n\n\n\n### Organisation of the Paralympics[edit]\n\n\nThe organisation of the 2000 Summer Paralympics was the responsibility of the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee (SPOC). However, much of the planning and operation of the Paralympic Games was outsourced to SOCOG such that most operational programmes planned both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\n\n\n### Other Olympic events[edit]\n\n\nThe organisation of the Games included not only the actual sporting events, but also the management (and sometimes construction) of the sporting venues and surrounding precincts, the organisation of the Sydney Olympic Arts Festival, and the Olympic torch relay, which began in Greece and travelled to Australia via numerous Oceania island nations.\n\n\n\n### Phases of the Olympic project[edit]\n\n\nThe staging of the Olympics were treated as a project on a vast scale, broken into several broad phases:\n\n\n\n* 1993 to 1996 – positioning\n* 1997 – going operational\n* 1998 – procurement/venuisation\n* 1999 – testing/refinement\n* 2000 – implementation\n* 2001 – post-implementation and wind-down\n\n\n### SOCOG organisational design[edit]\n\n\nThe internal organisation of SOCOG evolved over the phases of the project and changed, sometimes radically, several times.\n\n\nIn late 1998, the design was principally functional. The top two tiers below the CEO Sandy Hollway consisted of five groups (managed by Group General Managers and the Deputy CEO) and twenty divisions (managed by divisional General Managers), which in turn were further broken up into programmes and sub-programmes or projects.\n\n\nIn 1999, functional areas (FAs) broke up into geographic precinct and venue teams (managed by Precinct Managers and Venue Managers) with functional area staff reporting to both the FA manager and the venue manager. SOCOG moved to a matrix structure. The Interstate Football division extant in 1998 was the first of these geographically based venue teams.\n\n\n\n### Volunteer program[edit]\n\n\nThe origins of the volunteer program for Sydney 2000 dates back to the bid, as early as 1992.\n\n\nOn 17 December 1992, a group of Sydney citizens interested in the prospect of hosting the 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games gathered for a meeting at Sports House at Wentworth Park in Sydney.\n\n\nIn the period leading up to 1999, after Sydney had won the bid, the small group of volunteers grew from approximately 42 to around 500. These volunteers became known as Pioneer Volunteers. The Pioneer Volunteer program was managed internally by SOCOG's Volunteer Services Department in consultation with prominent peak groups like The Centre for Volunteering (Volunteering and TAFE. Some of the Pioneer Volunteers still meet every four months, an unseen legacy of the games which brought together a community spirit not seen before.\n\n\nDuring the Olympic games, tens of thousands of volunteers (the official figure placed at 46,967)[32] helped everywhere at the Olympic venues and elsewhere in the city. They were honoured with a parade like the athletes had a few days before.[33]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2000 Summer Olympics venues\n\n#### Sydney Olympic Park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sydney Olympic Park\n\n![](image)Stadium Australia\n![](image)Sydney Olympic Park Aquatic Centre\n![](image)State Hockey Centre\n* Stadium Australia: Ceremonies (opening/closing), Athletics, Football (final)\n* Sydney International Aquatic Centre: Diving, Modern Pentathlon (swimming) Swimming, Synchronised Swimming, Water Polo (medal events)\n* State Sports Centre: Table Tennis, Taekwondo\n* NSW Tennis Centre: Tennis\n* State Hockey Centre: Field Hockey\n* The Dome and Exhibition Complex: Badminton, Basketball, Gymnastics (rhythmic), Handball (final), Modern Pentathlon (fencing, shooting), Volleyball (indoor)\n* Sydney SuperDome: Gymnastics (artistic, trampoline), Basketball (final)\n* Sydney Baseball Stadium: Baseball, Modern Pentathlon (riding, running)\n* Sydney International Archery Park: Archery\n\n\n#### Sydney[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dunc Gray Velodrome\n* Sydney Convention & Exhibition Centre: Boxing, Fencing, Judo, Weightlifting, Wrestling\n* Sydney Entertainment Centre: Volleyball (indoor final)\n* Dunc Gray Velodrome: Cycling (track)\n* Sydney International Shooting Centre: Shooting\n* Sydney International Equestrian Centre: Equestrian\n* Sydney International Regatta Centre: Rowing, Canoeing (sprint)\n* Blacktown Olympic Centre: Baseball, Softball\n* Western Sydney Parklands: Cycling (mountain biking)\n* Ryde Aquatic Leisure Centre: Water Polo\n* Penrith Whitewater Stadium: Canoeing (slalom)\n* Bondi Beach: Volleyball (beach)\n* Sydney Football Stadium: Football\n* Olympic Sailing Shore Base: Sailing\n* Centennial Parklands: Cycling (road)\n* Marathon course: Athletics (marathon)\n* North Sydney: Athletics (marathon start)\n* Sydney Opera House: Triathlon.\n\n\n#### Outside Sydney[edit]\n\n\n* Canberra Stadium, Canberra: Football\n* Hindmarsh Stadium, Adelaide: Football\n* Melbourne Cricket Ground: Football\n* The Gabba (Brisbane Cricket Ground), Brisbane: Football\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Official logo[edit]\n\n\nThe bid logo was introduced in 1992 and created by architect and designer Michael Bryce.[34] It featured a colourful, stylised image of the Sydney Opera House which is a possible reference to the motif of the rainbow serpent. \n\n\nThe official logo was revealed in 1996, and is also referred to as the \"Millennium Man\".[35] It incorporated similar curves to the bid logo and combined them with a stylised image of a runner to form a torchbearer in motion. The image of the runners composed of two small yellow boomerangs for arms and a larger red boomerang for legs. Over the runner's head is a trail of smoke that represents the arches of the Sydney Opera House.[36]\n\n\nThe design process of the official logo, as well as all other aspects of the Olympic Games' visual design identity, was awarded to Melbourne design studio FHA Image Design.[37] The Sydney Olympics brand identity project officially started in 1993, and lasted 7 years. It was also up to FHA Design to prepare the visual identity of the Paralympic Games and this also absorbed some elements as the identification signals and the pictograms.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Olly, Syd and Millie\n\nThe official mascots chosen for the 2000 Summer Olympics were Syd the platypus, Millie the echidna, and Olly the kookaburra,[38] designed by Matthew Hattan and Jozef Szekeres and named by Philip Sheldon of agency Weekes Morris Osborn in response to the original SOCOG recommendation of Murray, Margery, and Dawn after famous Australian athletes.\n\n\nThere was also Fatso the Fat-Arsed Wombat, an unofficial mascot popularised by comedy team Roy Slaven and HG Nelson on the TV series *The Dream with Roy and HG*. Roy and HG also frequently disparaged the official mascots on their television program.[39][40][41]\n\n\n\n### Sponsors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Sponsors of the 2000 Summer Olympics** |\n| Global Olympic Partners\n* Atos Origin\n* The Coca-Cola Company\n* IBM\n* John Hancock\n* Kodak\n* McDonald's\n* Panasonic\n* Samsung Electronics\n* Sports Illustrated\n* Swatch\n* Visa\n* Xerox\n |\n| Australian Partners\n* AMP\n* Ansett Australia\n* BHP\n* EnergyAustralia\n* Holden\n* News Limited\n* Pacific Dunlop\n* Westfield\n* Seven Network\n* Swatch\n* Telstra\n* University of Fairfax\n* Westpac\n |\n| Supporters\n* 2UE\n* Adecco\n* Bonds\n* Bonlac\n* Boral\n* Carlton & United Breweries\n* ClubsNSW\n* Goodman Fielder\n* Nike\n* Olex Cables\n* Perth Mint\n* Robert Timms\n* Royal Australian Mint\n* Shell\n* Sleepmaker\n* TAFE NSW\n* Traveland\n* Tyco International\n |\n| Providers\n* Avis\n* Berkley Challenge Housekeeping Services\n* Buspak\n* Cadbury\n* Citysearch.com.au\n* Cleanevent\n* Clipsal\n* Crown Lift Trucks\n* Deutsche Bahn (DB Schenker)\n* Diamond Press\n* Frazer Nash\n* Garret Metal Detectors\n* General Electric\n* Generale Location\n* George Weston Foods\n* Great White Shark Enterprises\n* Hamiltons Laboratories\n* Harley-Davidson\n* Lifeminders.com\n* Lindeman's\n* Linfox\n* Looksmart\n* Mistral\n* New South Wales Department of Information Technology & Management\n* Pacific Waste Management\n* Ramler Furniture\n* Rogen\n* Salomon Smith Barney\n* Saunders Design\n* Showpower\n* Sonic Healthcare\n* Speedo\n* Val Morgan\n* Visy\n* Waste Services NSW\n* Woolcott Research\n* Woolmark\n |\n\n\n## Medals and bouquets[edit]\n\n\nA total of 750 gold, 750 silver and 780 bronze medals were minted for the Games. The gold and silver medals contained 99.99 percent of pure silver. The bronze medals were 99 percent bronze with one percent silver, they were made by melting down Australian one-cent and two-cent coins,[42][43][44] which had been removed from circulation from 1992 onward.\n\n\nThe bouquets handed to medal recipients incorporated foliage from the Grevillea baileyana, also known as the white oak.[45]\n\n\n\n## Awards and commendations[edit]\n\n\nThe International Olympic Committee awarded Sydney and its inhabitants with the \"Pierre de Coubertin Trophy\" in recognition of the collaboration and happiness shown by the people of Sydney during the event to all the athletes and visitors around the world.[46]\n\n\nAfter the games' end, the New South Wales Police Force was granted use of the Olympic Rings in a new commendation and citation as the IOC consideration after having staged the \"safest\" games ever.\n\n\n\n### Mo Awards[edit]\n\n\nThe Australian Entertainment Mo Awards (commonly known informally as the Mo Awards), were annual Australian entertainment industry awards. They recognise achievements in live entertainment in Australia from 1975 to 2016.[47]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Nominee / work\n | Award\n | Result (wins only)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000 Summer\n | Olympic Games Opening Ceremony\n | Special Event of the Year\n | Won\n |\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nIn F.J. Campbell's 2018 novel *No Number Nine*, the last part of the book is set at the Sydney 2000 Olympics.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn Tom Clancy's thriller *Rainbow Six* and its video game adaptation, the 2000 Olympic Games are the setting of a plot by eco-terrorists who plan to spread a deadly biological agent through Stadium Australia's cooling system.[48]\n\n\nIn Morris Gleitzman's children's book *Toad Rage*, a cane toad travels to Sydney in a bid to become the Olympic mascot.[49]\n\n\n*The Games* was a mockumentary television series run on the ABC network, with two seasons that ran in 1998 and 2000. The series satirized corruption and cronyism in the Olympic movement, bureaucratic ineptness in the New South Wales public service, and unethical behaviour within politics and the media. An unusual feature of the show was that the characters shared the same name as the actors who played them.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2000 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Australia\n\t+ 1956 Summer Olympics – Melbourne\n\t+ 2000 Summer Olympics – Sydney\n\t+ 2032 Summer Olympics – Brisbane\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* The Games of the XXVII Olympiad 2000: Music from the Opening Ceremony\n* Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi\n* John Coates\n* Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games – Sydney 2000\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The logo is a stylised image of a torchbearer; the top part, in blue, represents the smoke from the Olympic torch, which draws the outline of the Sydney Opera House; the middle part, in yellow, represents the head and arms of a torchbearer, the arms symbolised by two boomerangs; the bottom part, in red, depicts the torchbearer's legs, also symbolised by a boomerang.\n2. **^** The national teams of North Korea and South Korea competed separately in the Olympic events, even though they marched together as a unified Korean team in the opening ceremony.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Olympic Summer Games Factsheet\" (PDF).

It marked the second time the Summer Olympics were held in Australia, and in the Southern Hemisphere, the first being in Melbourne, in 1956.\n\n\nSydney was selected as the host city for the 2000 Games in 1993. Teams from 199 countries participated in the 2000 Games, which were the first to feature at least 300 events in its official sports program. The Games' cost was estimated to be A$6.6 billion. These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch before the arrival of his successor Jacques Rogge. The 2000 Games were the last of the two consecutive Summer Olympics to be held in a predominantly English-speaking country following the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States.\n\n\nThe final medal tally at the 2000 Summer Olympics was led by the United States, followed by Russia and China with host Australia in fourth place overall. Cameroon, Colombia, Latvia, Mozambique, and Slovenia won a gold medal for the first time in their Olympic histories, while Barbados, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, North Macedonia, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam won their first-ever Olympic medals. Australia will host the Summer Olympics again in 2032 at Brisbane, Queensland making it the first Oceanic country to host the Olympics three times.\n\n\nThe 2000 Games received universal acclaim, with the organization, volunteers, sportsmanship, and Australian public being lauded in the international media. Bill Bryson of *The Times* called the Sydney Games \"one of the most successful events on the world stage\", saying that they \"couldn't be better\".[3] James Mossop of the *Electronic Telegraph* called the Games \"such a success that any city considering bidding for future Olympics must be wondering how it can reach the standards set by Sydney\",[4] while Jack Todd of the *Montreal Gazette* suggested that the \"IOC should quit while it's ahead. Admit there can never be a better Olympic Games, and be done with it,\" as \"Sydney was both exceptional and the best\".[3] These games would provide the inspiration for London's winning bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in 2005; in preparing for the 2012 Games, Lord Coe declared the 2000 Games the \"benchmark for the spirit of the Games, unquestionably\", admitting that the London organizing committee \"attempted in several ways to emulate what the Sydney Organising Committee did.\"[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Host city selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2000 Summer Olympics\n\nSydney won the right to host the Games on 24 September 1993, after being selected over Beijing, Berlin, Istanbul, and Manchester in four rounds of voting, at the 101st IOC Session in Monte Carlo, Monaco. The Australian city of Melbourne which also hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics had lost out to Atlanta for the 1996 Summer Olympics three years earlier.[6] Beijing would later be selected to host the 2008 Summer Olympics eight years later on 13 July 2001 and the 2022 Winter Olympics twenty-two years later on 31 July 2015. Beijing's loss to Sydney was seen as a \"significant blow\" to an \"urgent political priority\" of the Chinese Communist Party leadership having mounted the most intense and expensive candidacy campaign at the date so far (this includes the Summer and Winter Games). Although it is unknown as two members of the International Olympic Committee voted for Sydney over Beijing in 1993, it appears that an important role was played by Human Rights Watch's campaign to \"stop Beijing\" because of China's human rights record and international isolation following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.[7] Many in China were angry at what they saw as U.S.-led interference in the vote, and the outcome contributed to rising anti-Western sentiment in China and a new phase in the tensions in Sino-American relations.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n2000 Summer Olympics bidding results[9]\n| City\n | NOC Name\n | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** | **Round 4** |\n| Sydney | ![](image) Australia | 30 | 30 | 37 | **45** |\n| Beijing | ![](image) China | **32** | **37** | **40** | 43\n |\n| Manchester | ![](image) Great Britain | 11 | 13 | 11 | —\n |\n| Berlin | ![](image) Germany | 9 | 9 | — | —\n |\n| Istanbul | ![](image) Turkey | 7 | — | — | —\n |\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Costs[edit]\n\n\nThe *Oxford Olympics Study 2016* estimates the outturn cost of the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics at US$5 billion in 2015 dollars and cost overrun at 90% in real terms.[10] This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) *operational costs* incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) *direct capital costs* incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are *not* included, such as for road, rail, airport infrastructure, hotel upgrades, or other business investments incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The cost for Sydney 2000 compares with a cost of US$4.6 billion for Rio 2016, US$40–44 billion for Beijing 2008, and US$51 billion for Sochi 2014, the most expensive Olympics in history. The average cost for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion, average cost overrun is 176%.\n\n\nIn 2000, the Auditor-General of New South Wales reported that the Sydney Games cost A$6.6 billion, with a net cost to the public between A$1.7 and A$2.4 billion.[11][12] In the years leading up to the games, funds were shifted from education and health programs to cover Olympic expenses.[13]\n\n\nIt has been estimated that the economic impact of the 2000 Olympics was that A$2.1 billion has been shaved from public consumption. Economic growth was not stimulated to a net benefit and in the years after 2000, foreign tourism to NSW grew by less than tourism to Australia as a whole. A \"multiplier\" effect on broader economic development was not realized, as a simple \"multiplier\" analysis fails to capture that resources have to be redirected from elsewhere: the building of a stadium is at the expense of other public works such as extensions to hospitals. Building sporting venues does not add to the aggregate stock of productive capital in the years following the Games: \"Equestrian centers, softball compounds, and man-made rapids are not particularly useful beyond their immediate function.\"[14]\n\n\nMany venues that were constructed in Sydney Olympic Park failed financially in the years immediately following the Olympics to meet the expected bookings to meet upkeep expenses. It was only the 2003 Rugby World Cup that reconnected the park back to citizens.[15] In recent years, infrastructure costs for some facilities have been of growing concern to the NSW Government, especially facilities in Western Sydney.[15] Proposed metro and light rail links from Olympic Park to Parramatta have been estimated to cost in the same order of magnitude as the public expenditure on the games.[16][*citation needed*] Stadium Australia had been considered for demolition in 2017 by then NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, citing that the stadium was \"built for an Olympics\" but not for modern spectators.[17] The plan was scrapped in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.[18] The Dunc Gray Velodrome has also struggled to keep up its $500,000 per year maintenance costs,[16] although it is still used for track cycling events.[19]\n\n\n\n### Chronological Summary of the 2000 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nAlthough the Opening Ceremony was not scheduled until 15 September, the football competitions began with preliminary matches on 13 September. Among the pre-ceremony fixtures, host nation Australia lost 1–0 to Italy at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which was the main stadium for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.\n\n\n\n#### Day 1: 15 September[edit]\n\n\n##### Cultural display highlights[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n\n![](image)The 2000 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony at Stadium Australia, on 15 September 2000.\nThe opening ceremony began with a tribute to the Australian pastoral heritage of the Australian stockmen and the importance of the stock horse in Australia's heritage. It was produced and filmed by the Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation and the home nation broadcaster Channel 7.[20] This was introduced by lone rider Steve Jefferys and his rearing Australian Stock Horse *Ammo*. At the cracking of Jefferys' stockwhip, a further 120 riders entered the stadium, their stock horses performing intricate steps, including forming the five Olympic Rings, to a Special Olympics version of the theme, which Bruce Rowland had previously composed for the 1982 film *The Man from Snowy River*.\n\n\nThe Australian National Anthem was sung in the first verse by Human Nature and the second by Julie Anthony.\n\n\nThe ceremony continued, showing many aspects of the land and its people: the affinity of the mainly coastal-dwelling Australians with the sea that surrounds the \"Island Continent\". The indigenous occupation of the land, the coming of the First Fleet, the continued immigration from many nations, and the rural industry on which the economy of the nation was built, including a display representing the harshness of rural life based on the paintings of Sir Sidney Nolan. Two memorable scenes were the representation of the \"Heart\" of the country by 200 Aboriginal women from Central Australia who danced up \"the mighty spirit of God to protect the Games\" and the overwhelmingly noisy representation of the construction industry by hundreds of tap-dancing teenagers.\n\n\nBecause Bibi Salisachs (the wife of IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch) was seriously ill and unable to accompany her husband to the Olympics, Dawn Fraser, former Australian Olympic Champion swimmer and member of the Parliament of New South Wales, accompanied Samaranch during the Australian cultural display, explaining to him some of the cultural references that are unfamiliar to non-Australians.\n\n\n\n##### Formal presentation[edit]\n\n\nA record 199 nations entered the stadium, with a record 80 of them winning at least one medal. The only missing IOC member was Afghanistan, who was banned due to the extremist rule of the Taliban's oppression of women and its prohibition of sports.[21] The ceremony featured a unified entrance by the athletes of North and South Korea,[b] using a specially designed unification flag: a white background flag with a blue map of the Korean Peninsula. Four athletes from East Timor also marched in the parade of nations as individual Olympic athletes and marched directly before the host country. Although the country-to-be had no National Olympic Committee then, they were allowed to compete under the Olympic Flag with country code IOA. The Governor-General, Sir William Deane, opened the games.\n\n\nThe Olympic Flag was carried around the arena by eight former Australian Olympic champions: Bill Roycroft, Murray Rose, Liane Tooth, Gillian Rolton, Marjorie Jackson, Lorraine Crapp, Michael Wenden and Nick Green. During the raising of the Olympics Flag, the Olympic Hymn was sung by the Millennium Choir of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia in Greek. Following this, Tina Arena sang a purpose-written pop song, *The Flame*.[22]\n\n\nThe opening ceremony concluded with the lighting of the Olympic Flame, which was brought into the stadium by former Australian Olympic champion Herb Elliott. Then, celebrating 100 years of women's participation in the Olympic Games, former Australian women Olympic medalists Betty Cuthbert and Raelene Boyle, Dawn Fraser, Shirley Strickland (later Shirley Strickland de la Hunty), Shane Gould and Debbie Flintoff-King brought the torch through the stadium, handing it over to Cathy Freeman, who lit the flame in the cauldron within a circle of fire. The choice of Freeman, an Aboriginal woman, to light the flame was notable given the history of human rights abuses against Aboriginal people in Australia.[23] Following her lighting, Freeman was the subject of racial abuse from some Australians.[24] The planned spectacular climax to the ceremony was delayed by the technical glitch of a computer switch which malfunctioned, causing the sequence to shut down by giving a false reading. This meant that the Olympic flame was suspended in mid-air for about four minutes rather than immediately rising up a water-covered ramp to the top of the stadium. When the cause of the problem was discovered, the program was overridden and the cauldron continued its course, and the ceremony concluded with a fireworks display.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Day 2: 16 September[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gold medallist Nancy Johnson (centre) of the U.S., raises her hands with silver medallist Kang Cho-hyun (left), of South Korea, and bronze winner Gao Jing (right), of China, during the first medal ceremony of the 2000 Olympic Games.\nThe first medals of the Games were awarded in the women's 10 metre air rifle competition, which was won by Nancy Johnson of the United States.\n\n\nThe Triathlon made its Olympic debut with the women's race. Set in the surroundings of the Sydney Opera House, Brigitte McMahon representing Switzerland swam, cycled and ran to the first gold medal in the sport, beating the favoured home athletes such as Michelie Jones who won silver. McMahon only passed Jones in sight of the finish line.\n\n\nThe first star of the Games was 17-year-old Australian Ian Thorpe, who first set a new world record in the 400-metre freestyle final before competing in an exciting 4 × 100 m freestyle final. Swimming the last leg, Thorpe passed the leading American team and arrived in a new world record time, two-tenths of a second ahead of the Americans. In the same event for women, the Americans also broke the world record, finishing ahead of the Netherlands and Sweden.\n\n\nSamaranch had to leave for home, as his wife was severely ill. Upon arrival, his wife had already died. Samaranch returned to Sydney four days later. The Olympic flag was flown at half-staff during the period as a sign of respect to Samaranch's wife.\n\n\n\n#### Day 3: 17 September[edit]\n\n\nCanadian Simon Whitfield sprinted away in the last 100 metres of the men's triathlon, becoming the inaugural winner in the event.\n\n\nOn the cycling track, Robert Bartko beat fellow German Jens Lehmann in the individual pursuit, setting a new Olympic Record. Leontien Zijlaard-van Moorsel set a world record in the semi-finals the same event for women.\n\n\nIn the swimming pool, American Tom Dolan beat the world record in the 400-metre medley, successfully defending the title he won in Atlanta four years prior. Dutchwoman Inge de Bruijn also clocked a new world record, beating her own time in the 100 m butterfly final to win by more than a second.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n#### Day 4: 18 September[edit]\n\n\nThe main event for the Australians on the fourth day of the Games was the 200 m freestyle. Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband had broken the world record in the semi-finals, taking it from the new Australian hero Ian Thorpe, who came close to the world record in his semi-final heat. As the final race finished, Van den Hoogenband's time was exactly the same as in the semi-finals, finishing ahead of Thorpe by half a second.\n\n\nChina won the gold medal in the men's team all-around gymnastics competition after being the runner-up in the previous two Olympics. The other medals were taken by Ukraine and Russia, respectively.\n\n\nZijlaard-van Moorsel lived up to the expectations set by her world record in cycling in the semis by winning the gold medal.\n\n\n\n#### Day 7: 21 September[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Women's Gymnastics All-Around, female athletes suffered damning scores and injuries due to improperly installed gymnastics equipment. Gymnasts performing on the vault gave uncharacteristically poor performances and fell. Officials blamed the series of falls and low scores on performance anxiety. It wasn't until Australian gymnast Allana Slater and her coach, Peggy Liddick, voiced concerns about the equipment that officials discovered the apparatus was five centimetres, or almost two inches, lower than it should've been. While athletes were given the opportunity to perform again, for some of them, the damage to their mental or physical health caused by the vault was irreparable. Chinese gymnast Kui Yuanyuan and American gymnast Kristen Maloney both injured their legs while attempting to stick their landings, with Kui needing to be carried to an examination area and Maloney damaging a titanium rod that had recently been implanted in her shin. Romanian gymnast Andreea Răducan ultimately took gold while her teammates, Simona Amânar and Maria Olaru took silver and bronze, respectively.\n\n\n\n#### Day 9: 23 September[edit]\n\n\nBy rowing in the winning coxless four, Steve Redgrave of Great Britain became a member of a select group who had won gold medals at five consecutive Olympics.\n\n\nThe swimming 4 x 100-metre medley relay of B.J. Bedford, Megan Quann (Jendrick), Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres became the first women's relay under 4-minutes, swimming 3:58 and setting a world record, claiming the gold medal for the United States.\n\n\n\n#### Day 10: 24 September[edit]\n\n\nRulon Gardner, never an NCAA champion or a world medalist, beat Alexander Karelin of Russia to win gold in the super heavyweight class, Greco-Roman wrestling. Karelin had won gold in Seoul, Barcelona and Atlanta. Before this fight, he had never lost in international competition, had been unbeaten in all competitions in 13 years, and had not surrendered a point in a decade.\n\n\n\n#### Day 11: 25 September[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cathy Freeman after the 400-metre final\nAustralian Cathy Freeman won the 400-metre final in front of a jubilant Sydney crowd at the Olympic Stadium, ahead of Lorraine Graham of Jamaica and Katharine Merry of Great Britain. Freeman's win made her the first competitor in Olympic Games history to light the Olympic Flame and then go on to win a Gold Medal. The attendance at the stadium was 112,524 – the largest attendance for any sport in Olympic Games history.\n\n\nIn a men's basketball pool match between the United States and France, the USA's Vince Carter made one of the most famous dunks in basketball history. After getting the ball off a steal, the 6'6\"/1.98 m Carter drove to the basket, with 7'2\"/2.18 m centre Frédéric Weis in his way. Carter jumped, spread his legs in midair, scraped Weis' head on the way up, and dunked. The French media dubbed the feat *le dunk de la mort* (\"the dunk of death\").\n\n\n\n#### Day 14: 28 September[edit]\n\n\nThe Canadian flag at the athletes' village was lowered to half-mast as Canadian athletes paid tribute to the former prime minister Pierre Trudeau after hearing of his death in Montreal (because of the time zone difference, it was 29 September in Sydney when Trudeau died). The Canadian flag was flown at half-mast for the remainder of the Olympics, on orders from both IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy, as the state funeral did not take place until 3 October, two days after the closing ceremony, and the Canadian athletes subsequently rushed back to attend his funeral after 1 October. \n\n\n\n#### Day 16: 30 September[edit]\n\n\nCameroon won a historic gold medal over Spain in the Men's Olympic Football Final at the Olympic Stadium. The game went to a penalty shootout, which was won by Cameroon 5–3.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Day 17: 1 October[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony\n\n![](image)Olympic colours on the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\nThe last event of the games was the Men's Marathon, contested on a course that started in North Sydney. The event was won by Ethiopian Gezahegne Abera, with Kenyan Erick Wainaina second, and Tesfaye Tola, also of Ethiopia, third. It was the first time since the 1968 Olympics that an Ethiopian won the gold medal in this event.\n\n\nThe closing ceremony commenced with Christine Anu performing her version of the Warumpi Band's song \"My Island Home\", with several Aboriginal dancers atop the Geodome Stage in the middle of the stadium, around which several hundred umbrella and lamp box kids created an image of Aboriginal Dreamtime. The Geodome Stage was used throughout the ceremony, which was a flat stage mechanically raised into the shape of a Geode.\n\n\nIOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch declared at the Closing Ceremony,[27]\n\n\n\n\n> \"I am proud and happy to proclaim that you have presented to the world the best Olympic Games ever.\"\n> \n> \n\n\nSubsequent Summer Olympics held in Athens, Beijing and London have been described by Samaranch's successor Jacques Rogge as \"unforgettable, dream Games\", \"truly exceptional\" and \"happy and glorious games\" respectively – the practice of declaring

featured wheelchair racing as exhibition events on the athletics schedule.[28]\n\n\nSpecial quarantine conditions were introduced to allow entry of horses into Australia to participate in equestrian events,[29] avoiding the need for such events to take place elsewhere as had happened at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\n*All dates are in AEDST (UTC+11); the

Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Participating countries\n![](image)Number of athletes\n199 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in the Sydney Games, two more than in the 1996 Summer Olympics; in addition, there were four Timorese Individual Olympic Athletes at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Eritrea, the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau made their Olympic debut this year.\n\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo was once again designated under that name, after it participated as Zaire from 1984 to 1996.\n\n\nAfghanistan was the only 1996 participant (and the only existing NOC) that did not participate in the 2000 Olympics, having been banned due to the Taliban's totalitarian rule in Afghanistan, their oppression of women, and its prohibition of sports.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Participating National Olympic Committees |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image) Albania (4 athletes)\n*

organisational structure circa 1998 – five groups and 33 divisions reporting to the CEO are organised primarily along functional lines with only a limited number of divisions (e.g. Interstate Football and Villages) anticipating a venue focussed design.\n![](image)SOCOG organisational structure circa 1999 – functional divisions and precinct/venue streams are organised in a matrix structure linked to the Main Operations Centre (MOC). Some functions such as Project Management (in the Games Coordination group) continue to exist largely outside this matrix structure.\n### Organisations responsible for the Olympics[edit]\n\n\nA number of quasi-government bodies were responsible for the construction, organisation and execution of the Sydney Games. These included:\n\n\n\n* the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) and the Sydney Paralympic Organizing Committee (SPOC), primarily responsibles for the staging of the Games\n* Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA), primarily responsible for construction and oversight\n* Olympic Roads & Transport Authority (ORTA)\n* Olympic Security Command Centre (OSCC)\n* Olympic Intelligence Centre (OIC)\n* JTF Gold the Australian Defence Force Joint Taskforce Gold\n* Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation (nominally part of SOCOG)\n* IBM, provider of technology and the Technical Command Centre\n* Telstra, provider of telecommunications\n* Great Big Events, event management and marketing\n\n\nThese organisations worked closely together and with other bodies such as:\n\n\n\n* the International Olympic Committee (IOC)\n* the International Paralympic Committee (IPC)\n* the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC)\n* the Australian Paralympic Committee (APC)\n* the other 197 National Olympic Committees (NOCs)\n* the other 125 National Paralympic Committees (NPCs)\n* the 33 International Sports Federations (IFs)\n* all three levels of Australian government (federal, state and local)\n* dozens of official sponsor and hundreds of official supplier companies\n\n\nThese bodies are often collectively referred to as the \"Olympic Family\".\n\n\n\n### Organisation of the Paralympics[edit]\n\n\nThe organisation of the 2000 Summer Paralympics was the responsibility of the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee (SPOC). However, much of the planning and operation of the Paralympic Games was outsourced to SOCOG such that most operational programmes planned both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\n\n\n### Other Olympic events[edit]\n\n\nThe organisation of the Games included not only the actual sporting events, but also the management (and sometimes construction) of the sporting venues and surrounding precincts, the organisation of the Sydney Olympic Arts Festival, and the Olympic torch relay, which began in Greece and travelled to Australia via numerous Oceania island nations.\n\n\n\n### Phases of the Olympic project[edit]\n\n\nThe staging of the Olympics were treated as a project on a vast scale, broken into several broad phases:\n\n\n\n* 1993 to 1996 – positioning\n* 1997 – going operational\n* 1998 – procurement/venuisation\n* 1999 – testing/refinement\n* 2000 – implementation\n* 2001 – post-implementation and wind-down\n\n\n### SOCOG organisational design[edit]\n\n\nThe internal organisation of SOCOG evolved over the phases of the project and changed, sometimes radically, several times.\n\n\nIn late 1998, the design was principally functional. The top two tiers below the CEO Sandy Hollway consisted of five groups (managed by Group General Managers and the Deputy CEO) and twenty divisions (managed by divisional General Managers), which in turn were further broken up into programmes and sub-programmes or projects.\n\n\nIn 1999, functional areas (FAs) broke up into geographic precinct and venue teams (managed by Precinct Managers and Venue Managers) with functional area staff reporting to both the FA manager and the venue manager. SOCOG moved to a matrix structure. The Interstate Football division extant in 1998 was the first of these geographically based venue teams.\n\n\n\n### Volunteer program[edit]\n\n\nThe origins of the volunteer program for Sydney 2000 dates back to the bid, as early as 1992.\n\n\nOn 17 December 1992, a group of Sydney citizens interested in the prospect of hosting the 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games gathered for a meeting at Sports House at Wentworth Park in Sydney.\n\n\nIn the period leading up to 1999, after Sydney had won the bid, the small group of volunteers grew from approximately 42 to around 500. These volunteers became known as Pioneer Volunteers. The Pioneer Volunteer program was managed internally by SOCOG's Volunteer Services Department in consultation with prominent peak groups like The Centre for Volunteering (Volunteering and TAFE. Some of the Pioneer Volunteers still meet every four months, an unseen legacy of the games which brought together a community spirit not seen before.\n\n\nDuring the Olympic games, tens of thousands of volunteers (the official figure placed at 46,967)[32] helped everywhere at the Olympic venues and elsewhere in the city. They were honoured with a parade like the athletes had a few days before.[33]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2000 Summer Olympics venues\n\n#### Sydney Olympic Park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sydney Olympic Park\n\n![](image)Stadium Australia\n![](image)Sydney Olympic Park Aquatic Centre\n![](image)State Hockey Centre\n* Stadium Australia: Ceremonies (opening/closing), Athletics, Football (final)\n* Sydney International Aquatic Centre: Diving, Modern Pentathlon (swimming) Swimming, Synchronised Swimming, Water Polo (medal events)\n* State Sports Centre: Table Tennis, Taekwondo\n* NSW Tennis Centre: Tennis\n* State Hockey Centre: Field Hockey\n* The Dome and Exhibition Complex: Badminton, Basketball, Gymnastics (rhythmic), Handball (final), Modern Pentathlon (fencing, shooting), Volleyball (indoor)\n* Sydney SuperDome: Gymnastics (artistic, trampoline), Basketball (final)\n* Sydney Baseball Stadium: Baseball, Modern Pentathlon (riding, running)\n* Sydney International Archery Park: Archery\n\n\n#### Sydney[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dunc Gray Velodrome\n* Sydney Convention & Exhibition Centre: Boxing, Fencing, Judo, Weightlifting, Wrestling\n* Sydney Entertainment Centre: Volleyball (indoor final)\n* Dunc Gray Velodrome: Cycling (track)\n* Sydney International Shooting Centre: Shooting\n* Sydney International Equestrian Centre: Equestrian\n* Sydney International Regatta Centre: Rowing, Canoeing (sprint)\n* Blacktown Olympic Centre: Baseball, Softball\n* Western Sydney Parklands: Cycling (mountain biking)\n* Ryde Aquatic Leisure Centre: Water Polo\n* Penrith Whitewater Stadium: Canoeing (slalom)\n* Bondi Beach: Volleyball (beach)\n* Sydney Football Stadium: Football\n* Olympic Sailing Shore Base: Sailing\n* Centennial Parklands: Cycling (road)\n* Marathon course: Athletics (marathon)\n* North Sydney: Athletics (marathon start)\n* Sydney Opera House: Triathlon.\n\n\n#### Outside Sydney[edit]\n\n\n* Canberra Stadium, Canberra: Football\n* Hindmarsh Stadium, Adelaide: Football\n* Melbourne Cricket Ground: Football\n* The Gabba (Brisbane Cricket Ground), Brisbane: Football\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Official logo[edit]\n\n\nThe bid logo was introduced in 1992 and created by architect and designer Michael Bryce.[34] It featured a colourful, stylised image of the Sydney Opera House which is a possible reference to the motif of the rainbow serpent. \n\n\nThe official logo was revealed in 1996, and is also referred to as the \"Millennium Man\".[35] It incorporated similar curves to the bid logo and combined them with a stylised image of a runner to form a torchbearer in motion. The image of the runners composed of two small yellow boomerangs for arms and a larger red boomerang for legs. Over the runner's head is a trail of smoke that represents the arches of the Sydney Opera House.[36]\n\n\nThe design process of the official logo, as well as all other aspects of the Olympic Games' visual design identity, was awarded to Melbourne design studio FHA Image Design.[37] The Sydney Olympics brand identity project officially started in 1993, and lasted 7 years. It was also up to FHA Design to prepare the visual identity of the Paralympic Games and this also absorbed some elements as the identification signals and the pictograms.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Olly, Syd and Millie\n\nThe official mascots chosen for the 2000 Summer Olympics were Syd the platypus, Millie the echidna, and Olly the kookaburra,[38] designed by Matthew Hattan and Jozef Szekeres and named by Philip Sheldon of agency Weekes Morris Osborn in response to the original SOCOG recommendation of Murray, Margery, and Dawn after famous Australian athletes.\n\n\nThere was also Fatso the Fat-Arsed Wombat, an unofficial mascot popularised by comedy team Roy Slaven and HG Nelson on the TV series *The Dream with Roy and HG*. Roy and HG also frequently disparaged the official mascots on their television program.[39][40][41]\n\n\n\n### Sponsors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Sponsors of the 2000 Summer Olympics** |\n| Global Olympic Partners\n* Atos Origin\n* The Coca-Cola Company\n* IBM\n* John Hancock\n* Kodak\n* McDonald's\n* Panasonic\n* Samsung Electronics\n* Sports Illustrated\n* Swatch\n* Visa\n* Xerox\n |\n| Australian Partners\n* AMP\n* Ansett Australia\n* BHP\n* EnergyAustralia\n* Holden\n* News Limited\n* Pacific Dunlop\n* Westfield\n* Seven Network\n* Swatch\n* Telstra\n* University of Fairfax\n* Westpac\n |\n| Supporters\n* 2UE\n* Adecco\n* Bonds\n* Bonlac\n* Boral\n* Carlton & United Breweries\n* ClubsNSW\n* Goodman Fielder\n* Nike\n* Olex Cables\n* Perth Mint\n* Robert Timms\n* Royal Australian Mint\n* Shell\n* Sleepmaker\n* TAFE NSW\n* Traveland\n* Tyco International\n |\n| Providers\n* Avis\n* Berkley Challenge Housekeeping Services\n* Buspak\n* Cadbury\n* Citysearch.com.au\n* Cleanevent\n* Clipsal\n* Crown Lift Trucks\n* Deutsche Bahn (DB Schenker)\n* Diamond Press\n* Frazer Nash\n* Garret Metal Detectors\n* General Electric\n* Generale Location\n* George Weston Foods\n* Great White Shark Enterprises\n* Hamiltons Laboratories\n* Harley-Davidson\n* Lifeminders.com\n* Lindeman's\n* Linfox\n* Looksmart\n* Mistral\n* New South Wales Department of Information Technology & Management\n* Pacific Waste Management\n* Ramler Furniture\n* Rogen\n* Salomon Smith Barney\n* Saunders Design\n* Showpower\n* Sonic Healthcare\n* Speedo\n* Val Morgan\n* Visy\n* Waste Services NSW\n* Woolcott Research\n* Woolmark\n |\n\n\n## Medals and bouquets[edit]\n\n\nA total of 750 gold, 750 silver and 780 bronze medals were minted for the Games. The gold and silver medals contained 99.99 percent of pure silver. The bronze medals were 99 percent bronze with one percent silver, they were made by melting down Australian one-cent and two-cent coins,[42][43][44] which had been removed from circulation from 1992 onward.\n\n\nThe bouquets handed to medal recipients incorporated foliage from the Grevillea baileyana, also known as the white oak.[45]\n\n\n\n## Awards and commendations[edit]\n\n\nThe International Olympic Committee awarded Sydney and its inhabitants with the \"Pierre de Coubertin Trophy\" in recognition of the collaboration and happiness shown by the people of Sydney during the event to all the athletes and visitors around the world.[46]\n\n\nAfter the games' end, the New South Wales Police Force was granted use of the Olympic Rings in a new commendation and citation as the IOC consideration after having staged the \"safest\" games ever.\n\n\n\n### Mo Awards[edit]\n\n\nThe Australian Entertainment Mo Awards (commonly known informally as the Mo Awards), were annual Australian entertainment industry awards. They recognise achievements in live entertainment in Australia from 1975 to 2016.[47]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Nominee / work\n | Award\n | Result (wins only)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000 Summer\n | Olympic Games Opening Ceremony\n | Special Event of the Year\n | Won\n |\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nIn F.J. Campbell's 2018 novel *No Number Nine*, the last part of the book is set at the Sydney 2000 Olympics.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn Tom Clancy's thriller *Rainbow Six* and its video game adaptation, the 2000 Olympic Games are the setting of a plot by eco-terrorists who plan to spread a deadly biological agent through Stadium Australia's cooling system.[48]\n\n\nIn Morris Gleitzman's children's book *Toad Rage*, a cane toad travels to Sydney in a bid to become the Olympic mascot.[49]\n\n\n*The Games* was a mockumentary television series run on the ABC network, with two seasons that ran in 1998 and 2000. The series satirized corruption and cronyism in the Olympic movement, bureaucratic ineptness in the New South Wales public service, and unethical behaviour within politics and the media. An unusual feature of the show was that the characters shared the same name as the actors who played them.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2000 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Australia\n\t+ 1956 Summer Olympics – Melbourne\n\t+ 2000 Summer Olympics – Sydney\n\t+ 2032 Summer Olympics – Brisbane\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* The Games of the XXVII Olympiad 2000: Music from the Opening Ceremony\n* Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi\n* John Coates\n* Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games – Sydney 2000\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The logo is a stylised image of a torchbearer; the top part, in blue, represents the smoke from the Olympic torch, which draws the outline of the Sydney Opera House; the middle part, in yellow, represents the head and arms of a torchbearer, the arms symbolised by two boomerangs; the bottom part, in red, depicts the torchbearer's legs, also symbolised by a boomerang.\n2. **^** The national teams of North Korea and South Korea competed separately in the Olympic events, even though they marched together as a unified Korean team in the opening ceremony.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Olympic Summer Games Factsheet\" (PDF).

The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete,[2][3] some 600 more than expected, accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries,[2] with 301 medal events in 28 different sports.[2] The 2004 Games marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance, and also marked the first time Athens hosted the Games since their first modern incarnation in 1896 as well as the return of the Olympic games to its birthplace. Athens became one of only four cities at the time to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two occasions (together with Paris, London and Los Angeles). A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games, replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since 1928. The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens[4] rectifying the long-running mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue.[5] The 2004 Games was the first of two consecutive Olympic games to be held in Southern Europe since the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, and was followed by the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.\n\n\nThe 2004 Olympic Games were hailed as \"unforgettable dream games\" by then-IOC President Jacques Rogge, and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure, including a new airport, ring road and subway system.[6] However, there has been debate regarding the cost of the Games and their possible contribution to the 2010–18 Greek government-debt crisis, although there is little or no evidence supporting such a correlation. The 2004 Games were generally deemed to be a success, with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world. The final medal tally was led by the United States, followed by China and Russia with host nation Greece at 15th place. Several world and Olympic records were also broken during these Games. \n\n\nChile, Chinese Taipei, Dominican Republic, Georgia and Israel won their first Olympic gold medals. Eritrea and Paraguay won their first ever Olympic medals. \nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) won both their first Olympic medal and gold medal in this event.\n\n\n\n\n## Host city selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2004 Summer Olympics\n\nAthens was chosen as the host city during the 106th IOC Session held in Lausanne, Switzerland on 5 September 1997. The Greek capital had lost its bid to organize the 1996 Summer Olympics to the American city of Atlanta nearly seven years before, during the 96th IOC Session in Tokyo, Japan on 18 September 1990. Under the direction of Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, Athens pursued another bid, this time for the right to host the Summer Olympics in 2004. The success of Athens in securing the 2004 Games was based largely on the bid's appeal to human values, the history of the Games from ancient age and modern age and the emphasis that Athens is placed at the pivotal role that Greece and Athens could play in promoting the Modern Olympism and the Olympic Movement.[7] Unlike the 1996 bid that was seen arrogant when the city was bidding, the 2004 bid was lauded for its low scale, humility, honest and earnestness, its focused message, and a more real and detailed bid concept.[8] During the unsuccessful 1996 bid, concerns and criticisms were raised – primarily regarding critical subjects about the city's infrastructural readiness, its air pollution, its budget and politicization of the Games' events and their preparations.[9] The subsequent successful organization of other events such as the 1991 Mediterranean Games, the 1994 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship, 1994 World Fencing Championships and the successful 1997 World Championships in Athletics, one month before the Olympic host city election was crucial in allaying lingering fears and concerns among the sporting community and some IOC members about the Greek ability to host international sporting events.[10] Another factor that contributed to the Greek capital's selection was a growing sentiment among some IOC members to restore some original values of the Olympics to the Modern Games, a component which they felt was lost during the 1996 Summer Olympics.[11]\n\n\nAfter leading all voting rounds, Athens easily defeated Rome in the fifth and final vote. Cape Town, Stockholm, and Buenos Aires, the three other cities that made the IOC shortlist, were eliminated in prior rounds of voting. Six other cities submitted applications, but their bids were dropped by the IOC in 1996. These cities were Istanbul, Lille, Rio de Janeiro (the latter won the rights to host the 2016 Summer Olympics in 2009), San Juan, Seville, and Saint Petersburg.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n2004 host city election – ballot results\n| City\n | Country (NOC)\n | **Round 1** | **Run-off** | **Round 3** | **Round 4** | **Round 5** |\n| Athens | ![](image) Greece | **32** | — | **38** | **52** | **66** |\n| Rome | ![](image) Italy | 23 | — | 28 | 35 | 41\n |\n| Cape Town | ![](image) South Africa | 16 | **62** | 22 | 20 | —\n |\n| Stockholm | ![](image) Sweden | 20 | — | 19 | — | —\n |\n| Buenos Aires | ![](image) Argentina | 16 | 44 | — | — | —\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\n### Costs[edit]\n\n\nThe 2004 Summer Olympic Games cost the Government of Greece near €9 billion to stage.[13] According to the cost-benefit evaluation of the impact of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games presented to the Greek Parliament in January 2013 by the Minister of Finance Mr. Giannis Stournaras, the overall net economic benefit for Greece was positive.[14]\n\n\nThe Athens 2004 Organizing Committee (ATHOC), responsible for the preparation and organisation of the Games, concluded its operations as a company in 2005 with a surplus of €130.6 million. The State's contribution to the total ATHOC budget was 8% of its expenditure against an originally anticipated 14%.\n\n\nThe overall revenue of ATHOC, including income from tickets, sponsors, broadcasting rights, merchandise sales etc, totalled near €2,1 million. The largest percentage of that income (38%) came from media rights.\n\n\nIt was in this sense that the Greek Ministry of Finance reported in 2013 that the expenses of the Greek state for the Athens 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games, including both infrastructure and organizational costs, reached the amount of €8.5 billion. The same report further explains that €2 billion of this amount was covered by the revenue of the ATHOC (from tickets, sponsors, broadcasting rights, merchandise sales etc.) and that another €2 billion was directly invested in upgrading hospitals and preserving archaeological sites.\nTherefore, the net infrastructure costs related to the preparation of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games was €4.5 billion, substantially lower than the reported estimates,[15] and mainly included long-standing fixed asset investments in numerous municipal and transport infrastructures.\n\n\nOn the revenue side, the same report estimates that incremental tax revenues of approximately €3.5 billion arose from the increased activities caused by the Athens 2004 Olympic Games during the period 2000 to 2004. These tax revenues were paid directly to the Greek state specifically in the form of incremental social security contributions, income taxes and VAT tax paid by all the companies, professionals, and service providers that were directly involved with the Olympic Games. Moreover, it is reported that the Athens 2004 Olympic Games have had a great economic growth impact on the Greek economy, in the words of the Greek Minister of Finance, is that \"as a result from the cost-benefit analysis, we reach the conclusion that there has been a net economic benefit from the Olympic Games\"\n\n\n\n### Comparison to other Olympic Games[edit]\n\n\nCost per sporting event for Athens 2004 was US$9.8 million. This compares with US$14.9 million for Rio 2016, US$49.5 million for London 2012, and US$22.5 million for Beijing 2008. Average cost per event for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$19.9 million.\n\n\nCost per athlete for Athens 2004 was US$0.3 million. This compares with US$0.4 million for Rio 2016, US$1.4 million for London 2012, and US$0.6 million for Beijing 2008. Average cost per athlete for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$0.6 million.\n\n\nCost overrun for Athens 2004 was 49%, measured in real terms from the bid to host the Games. This compares with 51% for Rio 2016 and 76% for London 2012. Average cost overrun for the Summer Games since 1960 is 176%.\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\nBy late March 2004, some Olympic projects were still behind schedule, and Greek authorities announced that a roof it had initially proposed as an optional, non-vital addition to the Aquatics Center would no longer be built. The main Olympic Stadium, the designated facility for the opening and closing ceremonies, was completed only two months before the Games opened. This stadium was completed with a retractable glass roof designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. The same architect also designed the Velodrome and other facilities.\n\n\nInfrastructure, such as the tram line linking venues in southern Athens with the city centre, and numerous venues were considerably behind schedule just two months before the start of the Games. The subsequent pace of preparation, however, made the rush to finish the Athens venues one of the tightest in Olympics history. The Greeks, unperturbed, maintained that they would make it all along. By July/August 2004, all venues were delivered: in August, the Olympic Stadium was officially completed and opened, joined or preceded by the official completion and openings of other venues within the Athens Olympic Sports Complex (OAKA), and the sports complexes in Faliro and Helliniko.\n\n\nLate July and early August witnessed the Athens Tram become operational, and this system provided additional connections to those already existing between Athens city centre and its waterfront communities along the Saronic Gulf. These communities included the port city of Piraeus, Agios Kosmas (site of the sailing venue), Helliniko (the site of the old international airport which now contained the fencing venue, the canoe/kayak slalom course, the 15,000-seat Helliniko Olympic Basketball Arena, and the softball and baseball stadia), and the Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex (site of the taekwondo, handball, indoor volleyball, and beach volleyball venues, as well as the newly reconstructed Karaiskaki Stadium for football). The upgrades to the Athens Ring Road were also delivered just in time, as were the expressway upgrades connecting central Athens with peripheral areas such as Markopoulo (site of the shooting and equestrian venues), the newly constructed Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, Schinias (site of the rowing venue), Maroussi (site of the OAKA), Parnitha (site of the Olympic Village), Galatsi (site of the rhythmic gymnastics and table tennis venue), and Vouliagmeni (site of the triathlon venue). The upgrades to the Athens Metro were also completed, and the new lines became operational by mid-summer.\n\n\nEMI released *Unity*, the official pop album of the Athens Olympics, in the leadup to the Olympics.[16] It features contributions from Sting, Lenny Kravitz, Moby, Destiny's Child, and Avril Lavigne.[16] EMI has pledged to donate US$180,000 from the album to UNICEF's HIV/AIDS program in Sub-Saharan Africa.[16]\n\n\nAt least 14 people died during the work on the facilities. Most of these people were not from Greece.[17]\n\n\nBefore the Games, Greek hotel staff staged a series of one-day strikes over wage disputes. They had been asking for a significant raise for the period covering the event being staged. Paramedics and ambulance drivers also protested. They claimed to have the right to the same Olympic bonuses promised to their security force counterparts.\n\n\n\n## Torch relay[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The ceremony for the lighting of the flame was arranged as a pagan pageant, with dancing priestesses.\nMain article: 2004 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\n![](image)The Olympic Flame toured the world for the first time.\nThe lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame took place on 25 March 2004 in Ancient Olympia. For the first time ever, the flame travelled around the world in a relay to various Summer Olympic host cities (past and future) and other large cities, before returning to Greece.\n\n\n\n## Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Athena and Phevos\n\nMascots have been a tradition at the Olympic Games since the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France. The 2004 Olympics had two official mascots: *Athena* and *Phevos* (Greek pronunciation: Athina and Fivos). The sister and brother were named after Athena, the goddess of wisdom, strategy and war, and Phoebus, the god of light and music, respectively. They were inspired by the ancient daidala, which were toy dolls that also had religious connotations.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nAthens Olympic Broadcasting served as the host broadcaster for the Games, providing over 35,000 hours of coverage to over 300 television channels around the world. Local rights to the Games were held by ERT which devoted their three channels (ET1, NET and ET3) to more than 24 hours of Olympic coverage.[18]\n\n\n\n### Online coverage[edit]\n\n\nFor the first time, major broadcasters were allowed to serve video coverage of the Olympics over the Internet, provided that they restricted this service geographically, to protect broadcasting contracts in other areas.[19] The International Olympic Committee forbade Olympic athletes, as well as coaches, support personnel and other officials, from setting up specialized weblogs and/or other websites for covering their personal perspective of the Games. They were not allowed to post audio, video, or photos that they had taken. An exception was made if an athlete already has a personal website that was not set up specifically for the Games.[20] NBC launched its own Olympic website, NBCOlympics.com. Focusing on the television coverage of the Games, it did provide video clips, medal standings, live results. Its main purpose, however, was to provide a schedule of what sports were on the many stations of NBC Universal. The Games were shown on television 24 hours a day, on one network or another.\n\n\n\n## Technology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the ATHOC Technology Operations Center during the Games.\nAs with any enterprise, the Organizing Committee and everyone involved with it relied heavily on technology in order to deliver a successful event. ATHOC maintained two separate data networks, one for the preparation of the Games (known as the Administrative network) and one for the Games themselves (Games Network). The technical infrastructure involved more than 11,000 computers, over 600 servers, 2,000 printers, 23,000 fixed-line telephone devices, 9,000 mobile phones, 12,000 TETRA devices, 16,000 TV and video devices and 17 Video Walls interconnected by more than 6,000 kilometers of cabling (both optical fiber and twisted pair).\n\n\nThis infrastructure was created and maintained to serve directly more than 150,000 ATHOC Staff, Volunteers, Olympic family members (IOC, NOCs, Federations), Partners & Sponsors and Media. It also kept the information flowing for all spectators, TV viewers, Website visitors and news readers around the world, prior and during the Games. The Media Center was located inside the Zappeion which is a Greek national exhibition center.\n\n\nBetween June and August 2004, the technology staff worked in the Technology Operations Center (TOC) from where it could centrally monitor and manage all the devices and flow of information, as well as handle any problems that occurred during the Games. The TOC was organized in teams (e.g. Systems, Telecommunications, Information Security, Data Network, Staffing, etc.) under a TOC Director and corresponding team leaders (Shift Managers). The TOC operated on a 24x7 basis with personnel organized into 12-hour shifts.\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Olympic Flame at the opening ceremony\nMain article: 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n\nThe opening ceremony of the games, directed by choreographer Dimitris Papaioannou and produced by Jack Morton Worldwide, led by project director David Zolkwer, was held on 13 August 2004. It began with a twenty-eight (the number of the Olympiads up to then) second countdown paced by the sounds of an amplified heartbeat.[21] As the countdown was completed, fireworks rumbled and illuminated the skies overhead. After a drum corps and bouzouki players joined in an opening march, the video screen showed images of flight, crossing southwest from Athens over the Greek countryside to ancient Olympia. Then, a single drummer in the ancient stadium joined in a drum duet with a single drummer in the main stadium in Athens, joining the original ancient Olympic Games with the modern ones in symbolism. At the end of the drum duet, a single flaming arrow was launched from the video screen (symbolically from ancient Olympia) and into the reflecting pool, which resulted in fire erupting in the middle of the stadium creating a burning image of the Olympic rings rising from the pool. The Opening Ceremony was a pageant of traditional Greek culture and history hearkening back to its mythological beginnings. The program began as a young Greek boy sailed into the stadium on a 'paper-ship' waving the host nation's flag to aethereal music by Hadjidakis and then a centaur appeared, followed by a gigantic head of a cycladic figurine which eventually broke into many pieces symbolising the Greek islands. Underneath the cycladic head was a Hellenistic representation of the human body, reflecting the concept and belief in perfection reflected in Greek art. A man was seen balancing on a hovering cube symbolising man's eternal 'split' between passion and reason followed by a couple of young lovers playfully chasing each other while the god Eros was hovering above them. There followed a very colourful float parade chronicling Greek history from the ancient Minoan civilization to modern times.\n\n\nAlthough NBC in the United States presented the entire opening ceremony from start to finish, a topless Minoan priestess was shown only briefly, the breasts having been pixelated digitally in order to avoid controversy (as the \"Nipplegate\" incident was still fresh in viewer's minds at the time) and potential fines by the Federal Communications Commission. Also, lower frontal nudity of men dressed as ancient Greek statues was shown in such a way that the area below the waist was cut off by the bottom of the screen. Overall, NBC's coverage of the Olympics has been praised, and the company was awarded with 6 Emmy Awards for its coverage of the Games and technical production.[22][23] Additionally, NBC televised all 28 sports in the 2004 Games, becoming the first broadcaster to do so.[24]\n\n\nFollowing the artistic performances, a parade of nations entered the stadium with over 10,500 athletes walking under the banners of 201 nations. The nations were arranged according to Greek alphabet making the Philippines, Finland, Fiji, Chile, and Hong Kong the last five to enter the stadium before the Greek delegation. On this occasion, in observance of the tradition that the delegation of Greece opens the parade and the host nation closes it, the Greek flag bearer opened the parade and all the Greek delegation closed it. Based on audience reaction, the emotional high point of the parade was the entrance of the delegation from Afghanistan which had been absent from the Olympics and had female competitors for the first time. The Iraqi delegation also stirred emotions. Also recognized was the symbolic unified march of athletes from North Korea and South Korea under the Korean Unification Flag.[c] The country of Kiribati made its debut appearance at these Games and East Timor made a debut under its own flag. After the Parade of Nations, during which the Dutch DJ Tiësto provided the music, the Icelandic singer Björk performed the song \"Oceania\", written specially for the event by her and the poet Sjón.\n\n\nThe opening ceremony culminated in the lighting of the Olympic cauldron by 1996 gold medalist windsurfer Nikolaos Kaklamanakis. Many key moments in the ceremony, including the lighting of the Olympic Cauldron, featured music composed and arranged by New Zealander composer John Psathas.[25] The gigantic cauldron, which was styled after the Athens 2004 Olympic torch, pivoted down to be lit by the 35-year-old, before slowly swinging up and lifting the flame above the stadium. Following this, a fireworks display commenced to conclude the ceremony.\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Participating nations\n![](image)Team numbers\nAll National Olympic Committees (NOCs) except Djibouti participated in the Athens Games. Two new NOCs had been created since 2000 and made their debut at these Games (Kiribati and East Timor). Therefore, with the return of Afghanistan (who had been banned from the 2000 Summer Olympics), the number of participating nations increased from 199 to 201. Also since 2000, Yugoslavia had changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro and its code from YUG to SCG. Georgia's new flag made its debut at the Olympics by unfurling it at the opening ceremony on 13 August. It replaces the post-Soviet flag, which had been used since Lillehammer 1994.\n\n\nIn the table below, the number in parentheses indicates the number of participants contributed by each NOC.\n\n\n\n|

Officially there were 301 events in 28 sports as swimming, diving, synchronised swimming and water polo are classified by the IOC as disciplines within the sport of aquatics, and wheelchair racing was a demonstration sport. For the first time, the wrestling category featured women's wrestling and in the fencing competition women competed in the sabre. American Kristin Heaston, who led off the qualifying round of women's shot put became the first woman to compete at the ancient site of Olympia.\n\n\nThe demonstration sport of wheelchair racing was a joint Olympic/Paralympic event, allowing a Paralympic event to occur within the Olympics, and for the future, opening up the wheelchair race to the able-bodied. The 2004 Summer Paralympics were also held in Athens, from 17 to 28 September.\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2004 Summer Olympic Sports Programme\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *

Tunisia, a penalty taken by Tunisia had to be retaken five times.\n* Greek sprinters Konstantinos Kenteris and Ekaterini Thanou withdraw from the games after allegedly staging a motorcycle accident in order to avoid a drug test.\n* The shot put event was held in ancient Olympia, site of the ancient Olympic Games (this was the very first time women athletes competed in Ancient Olympia), while the archery competition and the men's and women's marathon finish were held in the Panathenaic Stadium, in which the 1896 Games were held.[27]\n* Kiribati and Timor Leste participated in the Olympic Games for the first time.[27]\n* Women's wrestling and women's sabre made their Olympic debut at the 2004 Games.[27]\n* With 6 gold, 6 silver, and 4 bronze medals, Greece had its best medal tally in over 100 years (since hosting the 1896 Olympics), continuing the nation's sporting success after winning Euro 2004 in July.\n* The marathon was held on the same route as the 1896 Games, beginning in the site of the Battle of Marathon to the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens.[27]\n* Australia became the first country in Olympic history to win more gold medals (17) immediately after hosting the Olympics in Sydney 2000 where they won 16 gold medals.\n* World record holder and strong favourite Paula Radcliffe crashed out of the women's marathon in spectacular fashion, leaving Mizuki Noguchi to win the gold.\n* While leading in the men's marathon with less than 10 kilometres to go, Brazilian runner Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima was attacked by Irish priest Neil Horan and dragged into the crowd. De Lima recovered to take bronze, and was later awarded the Pierre de Coubertin medal for sportsmanship.[27] Twelve years later, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics, he lit the Olympic Cauldron at Maracanã Stadium.\n* British athlete Kelly Holmes won gold in the 800 m and 1500 m.[27]\n* Liu Xiang won the first ever gold medal in men's track and field for China in the 110 m hurdles, equalling Colin Jackson's 1993 World Record time of 12.91 seconds.\n* Kenyan runners swept the medals in the 3000 meters steeple chase.[27]\n* The Olympics saw Afghanistan's first return to the Games since 1996 (it was banned due to the Taliban's extremist attitudes towards women, but was reinstated in 2002).\n* Hicham El Guerrouj wins gold in the 1500 m and 5000 m. He was the first person to accomplish this feat at the Olympics since Paavo Nurmi in 1924.[27]\n* Greek athlete Fani Halkia came out of retirement to win the 400 m hurdles.\n* The US women's 4×200 m swimming team of Natalie Coughlin, Carly Piper, Dana Vollmer and Kaitlin Sandeno won gold, smashing the long-standing world record set by the German Democratic Republic in 1987.\n* Argentina beat Italy 84–69 in the men's basketball final for their first gold medal in the sport.\n* Windsurfer Gal Fridman won Israel's first-ever gold medal.\n* Dominican athlete Félix Sánchez won the first ever gold medal for the Dominican Republic in the 400 m hurdles event.\n* German kayaker Birgit Fischer won gold in the K-4 500 m and silver in the K-2 500 m. In so doing, she became the first woman in any sport to win gold medals at 6 different Olympics, the first woman to win gold 24 years apart and the first person in Olympic history to win two or more medals in five different Games.\n* Swimmer Michael Phelps became the first athlete to win 8 medals (6 gold and 2 bronze) in non-boycotted Olympics.[27]\n* United States' gymnast Carly Patterson became the second American woman to win the all-around gold medal, and the first American woman to win the all-around competition at a non-boycotted Olympic Games.\n* Chilean Tennis players Nicolás Massu and Fernando Gonzalez won the gold medal in the Doubles Competition, while Massu won the gold and Gonzalez the bronze on the Singles competition. These were Chile's first-ever gold medals. With these victories, Massú became the thirteenth Tennis player (and the eighth male player) in history to have won the gold medal in both the Singles and Doubles Competition during the same Olympic Games. He also became the second Tennis player, and first male player, to have achieved this feat in modern Olympic Tennis (1988 onwards). The first player to do so was Venus Williams in 2000.[27]\n* Usain Bolt of Jamaica, in his first career Olympic Games, finished fifth in his 200m dash heat in 21.05 seconds, failing to qualify for the second round. In the years to come, he would go on to become the world's fastest man, with multiple world records in the 100m, 200m and 4×100m and a medal count of over 29 global medals, including 8 Olympic gold medals and 11 World Championships gold medals.\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Balloons falling at the Athens 2004 Olympics closing ceremony\nMain article: 2004 Summer Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe Games were concluded on 29 August 2004. The closing ceremony was held at the Athens Olympic Stadium, where the Games had been opened 16 days earlier. Around 70,000 people gathered in the stadium to watch the ceremony.\n\n\nThe initial part of the ceremony interspersed the performances of various Greek singers, and featured traditional Greek dance performances from various regions of Greece (Crete, Thessaly, etc.). The event was meant to highlight the pride of the Greeks in their culture and country for the world to see.\n\n\nA significant part of the closing ceremony was the exchange of the Olympic flag of the Athens Games between the mayor of Athens and the mayor of Beijing, host city of the next Olympics. After the flag exchange a presentation from the Beijing delegation presented a glimpse into Chinese culture for the world to see. Beijing University students (who were at first incorrectly cited as the Twelve Girls Band) sang Mo Li Hua (Jasmine Flower) accompanied by a ribbon dancer, then some male dancers did a routine with tai chi and acrobatics, followed by dancers from the Peking Opera and finally, a little Chinese girl singing a reprise of Mo Li Hua and concluded the presentation by saying \"Welcome to Beijing!\"\n\n\nThe medal ceremony for the last event of the Olympics, the men's marathon, was conducted, with Stefano Baldini from Italy as the winner. The bronze medal winner, Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima of Brazil, was simultaneously announced as a recipient of the Pierre de Coubertin medal for his bravery in finishing the race despite being attacked by a rogue spectator while leading with 7 km to go.\n\n\nA flag-bearer from each nation's delegation then entered along the stage, followed by the competitors *en masse* on the floor. All of them were led by Pyrros Dimas (weightlifter) and Liu Xiang (hurdler).\n\n\nShort speeches were presented by Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, President of the Organising Committee, and by President Dr. Jacques Rogge of the IOC, in which he described the Athens Olympics as \"unforgettable, dream Games\".[6]\n\n\nDr. Rogge had previously declared he would be breaking with tradition in his closing speech as President of the IOC and that he would never use the words of his predecessor Juan Antonio Samaranch, who used to always say 'these were the best ever games'.[6] Dr. Rogge had described Salt Lake City 2002 as \"superb games\" and in turn would continue after Athens 2004 and describe Turin 2006 as \"truly magnificent games.\"\n\n\nThe national anthems of Greece and China were played in a handover ceremony as both nations' flags were raised. The Mayor of Athens, Dora Bakoyianni, passed the Olympic Flag to the Mayor of Beijing, Wang Qishan. After a short cultural performance by Chinese actors, dancers, and musicians directed by eminent Chinese director Zhang Yimou, Rogge declared the 2004 Olympic Games closed. The Olympic flag was next raised again on 10 February 2006 during the opening ceremony of the next Winter Olympics in Torino.\n\n\nA young Greek girl, 10-year-old Fotini Papaleonidopoulou, lit a symbolic lantern with the Olympic Flame and passed it on to other children before \"extinguishing\" the flame in the cauldron by blowing a puff of air. The ceremony ended with a variety of musical performances by Greek singers, including Dionysis Savvopoulos, George Dalaras, Haris Alexiou, Anna Vissi, Sakis Rouvas, Eleftheria Arvanitaki, Alkistis Protopsalti, Antonis Remos, Michalis Hatzigiannis, Marinella, and Dimitra Galani, as thousands of athletes carried out symbolic displays on the stadium floor.\n\n\n\n## Medal count[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2004 Summer Olympics medal table\n\n![](image)Army Maj.

The pieces depict landmarks in Greece as well as ancient and modern sports on the obverse of the coin. On the reverse, a common motif with the logo of the Games, circled by an olive branch representing the spirit of the Games.\n\n\nPreparations to stage the Olympics led to a number of positive developments for the city's infrastructure. These improvements included the establishment of Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, a modern new international airport serving as Greece's main aviation gateway;[28] expansions to the Athens Metro[29] system; the \"Tram\", a new metropolitan tram (light rail) system[30] system; the \"Proastiakos\", a new suburban railway system linking the airport and suburban towns to the city of Athens; the \"Attiki Odos\", a new toll motorway encircling the city,[31] and the conversion of streets into pedestrianized walkways in the historic center of Athens which link several of the city's main tourist sites, including the Parthenon and the Panathenaic Stadium (the site of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896).[32][33] All of the above infrastructure is still in use to this day, and there have been continued expansions and proposals to expand Athens' metro, tram, suburban rail and motorway network, the airport, as well as further plans to pedestrianize more thoroughfares in the historic center of Athens.\n\n\nThe Greek Government has created a corporation, Olympic Properties SA, which is overseeing the post-Olympics management, development and conversion of these facilities, some of which will be sold off (or have already been sold off) to the private sector,[34][35] while some other facilities are still in use, or have been converted for commercial use or modified for other sports.[36]\n\n\nAs of 2012 many conversion schemes have stalled owing to the Greek government-debt crisis, though many of these facilities are now under the control of domestic sporting clubs and organizations or the private sector.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe table below delineates the current status of the Athens Olympic facilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Facility\n | Olympics use\n | Current/Proposed use\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Athens Olympic Stadium (OAKA)\n | Opening & Closing Ceremonies, Track & Field, Football\n | Home pitch for Panathinaikos FC,[37] AEK FC[38] (football; Greek Super League, UEFA Champions League), Greece national football team (some matches), International football competitions;[39] Track & Field events (e.g. IAAF Athens Grand Prix[40]), Concerts[41][42][43] |\n| Athens Olympic Indoor Hall | Basketball, Gymnastics\n | Home court for Panathinaikos BC[44] and AEK BC[45] (Greek basketball league); Greece men's national basketball team, International basketball competitions,[46] Concerts[47][48] |\n| Athens Olympic Aquatic Centre | Swimming, Diving, Synchronized Swimming, Water Polo\n | Domestic and international swimming meets,[49][50][51] Public pool,[52] domestic league and European water-polo games.\n |\n| Athens Olympic Tennis Centre | Tennis\n | Domestic and international tennis matches, training courts open to the public and home of the Athens Tennis Academy, currently the best-kept facility in the complex[53][54] |\n| Athens Olympic Velodrome | Cycling\n | Domestic and international cycling meets[55] |\n| Peace and Friendship Stadium | Volleyball\n | Home court for Olympiacos BC (basketball),[56] Concerts, Conventions and trade shows[57] |\n| Helliniko Olympic Indoor Arena | Basketball, Handball\n | Home court for Panionios BC (basketball),[58] Conventions and trade shows[52] |\n| Hellinikon Canoe/Kayak Slalom Centre | Canoe/Kayak\n | Turned over to a private consortium (J&P AVAX, GEP, Corfu Waterparks and BIOTER), plans to convert it to a water park,[59][60] although currently it is abandoned.\n |\n| Hellinikon Olympic Hockey Centre | Field Hockey\n | Mini-football, will be part of new Hellinikon metropolitan park complex[61] |\n| Hellinikon Baseball Stadium | Baseball\n | Main ground (no. 1) converted to football pitch, home field of Ethnikos Piraeus F.C.

Finally, popular arguments about \"rotting\" of many of the facilities, appear to ignore the actual utilization of most of these structures.[102][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2004 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Greece\n\t+ 1896 Summer Olympics – Athens\n\t+ 2004 Summer Olympics – Athens\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* List of 2004 Summer Olympics medal winners\n* Olympic records at the 2004 Summer Olympics\n* Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games – 2004 Athens\n* World records at the 2004 Summer Olympics\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The 2004 Olympic Games emblem is a wreath made from an olive tree branch, or kotinos. The emblem is a reference to the ancient Olympic Games, where the kotinos was the official award of Olympic champions. In addition, the olive was the sacred tree of Athens. The colours of the emblem symbolise the shades of white and blue found in the Greek countryside; Down below the word \"ATHENS 2004\" was put above the Olympic ring.\n2. **^** Standard Modern Greek pronunciation is [θeriˈni olibi.aˈci aˈɣonez ðˈio çiˈʎaðes ˈtesera].\n3. **^** The national teams of North Korea and South Korea competed separately in the Olympic events, even though they marched together as a unified Korean team in the opening ceremony.

The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete,[2][3] some 600 more than expected, accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries,[2] with 301 medal events in 28 different sports.[2] The 2004 Games marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance, and also marked the first time Athens hosted the Games since their first modern incarnation in 1896 as well as the return of the Olympic games to its birthplace. Athens became one of only four cities at the time to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two occasions (together with Paris, London and Los Angeles). A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games, replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since 1928. The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens[4] rectifying the long-running mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue.[5] The 2004 Games was the first of two consecutive Olympic games to be held in Southern Europe since the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, and was followed by the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.\n\n\nThe 2004 Olympic Games were hailed as \"unforgettable dream games\" by then-IOC President Jacques Rogge, and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure, including a new airport, ring road and subway system.[6] However, there has been debate regarding the cost of the Games and their possible contribution to the 2010–18 Greek government-debt crisis, although there is little or no evidence supporting such a correlation. The 2004 Games were generally deemed to be a success, with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world. The final medal tally was led by the United States, followed by China and Russia with host nation Greece at 15th place. Several world and Olympic records were also broken during these Games. \n\n\nChile, Chinese Taipei, Dominican Republic, Georgia and Israel won their first Olympic gold medals. Eritrea and Paraguay won their first ever Olympic medals. \nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) won both their first Olympic medal and gold medal in this event.\n\n\n\n\n## Host city selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2004 Summer Olympics\n\nAthens was chosen as the host city during the 106th IOC Session held in Lausanne, Switzerland on 5 September 1997. The Greek capital had lost its bid to organize the 1996 Summer Olympics to the American city of Atlanta nearly seven years before, during the 96th IOC Session in Tokyo, Japan on 18 September 1990. Under the direction of Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, Athens pursued another bid, this time for the right to host the Summer Olympics in 2004. The success of Athens in securing the 2004 Games was based largely on the bid's appeal to human values, the history of the Games from ancient age and modern age and the emphasis that Athens is placed at the pivotal role that Greece and Athens could play in promoting the Modern Olympism and the Olympic Movement.[7] Unlike the 1996 bid that was seen arrogant when the city was bidding, the 2004 bid was lauded for its low scale, humility, honest and earnestness, its focused message, and a more real and detailed bid concept.[8] During the unsuccessful 1996 bid, concerns and criticisms were raised – primarily regarding critical subjects about the city's infrastructural readiness, its air pollution, its budget and politicization of the Games' events and their preparations.[9] The subsequent successful organization of other events such as the 1991 Mediterranean Games, the 1994 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship, 1994 World Fencing Championships and the successful 1997 World Championships in Athletics, one month before the Olympic host city election was crucial in allaying lingering fears and concerns among the sporting community and some IOC members about the Greek ability to host international sporting events.[10] Another factor that contributed to the Greek capital's selection was a growing sentiment among some IOC members to restore some original values of the Olympics to the Modern Games, a component which they felt was lost during the 1996 Summer Olympics.[11]\n\n\nAfter leading all voting rounds, Athens easily defeated Rome in the fifth and final vote. Cape Town, Stockholm, and Buenos Aires, the three other cities that made the IOC shortlist, were eliminated in prior rounds of voting. Six other cities submitted applications, but their bids were dropped by the IOC in 1996. These cities were Istanbul, Lille, Rio de Janeiro (the latter won the rights to host the 2016 Summer Olympics in 2009), San Juan, Seville, and Saint Petersburg.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n2004 host city election – ballot results\n| City\n | Country (NOC)\n | **Round 1** | **Run-off** | **Round 3** | **Round 4** | **Round 5** |\n| Athens | ![](image) Greece | **32** | — | **38** | **52** | **66** |\n| Rome | ![](image) Italy | 23 | — | 28 | 35 | 41\n |\n| Cape Town | ![](image) South Africa | 16 | **62** | 22 | 20 | —\n |\n| Stockholm | ![](image) Sweden | 20 | — | 19 | — | —\n |\n| Buenos Aires | ![](image) Argentina | 16 | 44 | — | — | —\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\n### Costs[edit]\n\n\nThe 2004 Summer Olympic Games cost the Government of Greece near €9 billion to stage.[13] According to the cost-benefit evaluation of the impact of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games presented to the Greek Parliament in January 2013 by the Minister of Finance Mr. Giannis Stournaras, the overall net economic benefit for Greece was positive.[14]\n\n\nThe Athens 2004 Organizing Committee (ATHOC), responsible for the preparation and organisation of the Games, concluded its operations as a company in 2005 with a surplus of €130.6 million. The State's contribution to the total ATHOC budget was 8% of its expenditure against an originally anticipated 14%.\n\n\nThe overall revenue of ATHOC, including income from tickets, sponsors, broadcasting rights, merchandise sales etc, totalled near €2,1 million. The largest percentage of that income (38%) came from media rights.\n\n\nIt was in this sense that the Greek Ministry of Finance reported in 2013 that the expenses of the Greek state for the Athens 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games, including both infrastructure and organizational costs, reached the amount of €8.5 billion. The same report further explains that €2 billion of this amount was covered by the revenue of the ATHOC (from tickets, sponsors, broadcasting rights, merchandise sales etc.) and that another €2 billion was directly invested in upgrading hospitals and preserving archaeological sites.\nTherefore, the net infrastructure costs related to the preparation of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games was €4.5 billion, substantially lower than the reported estimates,[15] and mainly included long-standing fixed asset investments in numerous municipal and transport infrastructures.\n\n\nOn the revenue side, the same report estimates that incremental tax revenues of approximately €3.5 billion arose from the increased activities caused by the Athens 2004 Olympic Games during the period 2000 to 2004. These tax revenues were paid directly to the Greek state specifically in the form of incremental social security contributions, income taxes and VAT tax paid by all the companies, professionals, and service providers that were directly involved with the Olympic Games. Moreover, it is reported that the Athens 2004 Olympic Games have had a great economic growth impact on the Greek economy, in the words of the Greek Minister of Finance, is that \"as a result from the cost-benefit analysis, we reach the conclusion that there has been a net economic benefit from the Olympic Games\"\n\n\n\n### Comparison to other Olympic Games[edit]\n\n\nCost per sporting event for Athens 2004 was US$9.8 million. This compares with US$14.9 million for Rio 2016, US$49.5 million for London 2012, and US$22.5 million for Beijing 2008. Average cost per event for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$19.9 million.\n\n\nCost per athlete for Athens 2004 was US$0.3 million. This compares with US$0.4 million for Rio 2016, US$1.4 million for London 2012, and US$0.6 million for Beijing 2008. Average cost per athlete for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$0.6 million.\n\n\nCost overrun for Athens 2004 was 49%, measured in real terms from the bid to host the Games. This compares with 51% for Rio 2016 and 76% for London 2012. Average cost overrun for the Summer Games since 1960 is 176%.\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\nBy late March 2004, some Olympic projects were still behind schedule, and Greek authorities announced that a roof it had initially proposed as an optional, non-vital addition to the Aquatics Center would no longer be built. The main Olympic Stadium, the designated facility for the opening and closing ceremonies, was completed only two months before the Games opened. This stadium was completed with a retractable glass roof designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. The same architect also designed the Velodrome and other facilities.\n\n\nInfrastructure, such as the tram line linking venues in southern Athens with the city centre, and numerous venues were considerably behind schedule just two months before the start of the Games. The subsequent pace of preparation, however, made the rush to finish the Athens venues one of the tightest in Olympics history. The Greeks, unperturbed, maintained that they would make it all along. By July/August 2004, all venues were delivered: in August, the Olympic Stadium was officially completed and opened, joined or preceded by the official completion and openings of other venues within the Athens Olympic Sports Complex (OAKA), and the sports complexes in Faliro and Helliniko.\n\n\nLate July and early August witnessed the Athens Tram become operational, and this system provided additional connections to those already existing between Athens city centre and its waterfront communities along the Saronic Gulf. These communities included the port city of Piraeus, Agios Kosmas (site of the sailing venue), Helliniko (the site of the old international airport which now contained the fencing venue, the canoe/kayak slalom course, the 15,000-seat Helliniko Olympic Basketball Arena, and the softball and baseball stadia), and the Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex (site of the taekwondo, handball, indoor volleyball, and beach volleyball venues, as well as the newly reconstructed Karaiskaki Stadium for football). The upgrades to the Athens Ring Road were also delivered just in time, as were the expressway upgrades connecting central Athens with peripheral areas such as Markopoulo (site of the shooting and equestrian venues), the newly constructed Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, Schinias (site of the rowing venue), Maroussi (site of the OAKA), Parnitha (site of the Olympic Village), Galatsi (site of the rhythmic gymnastics and table tennis venue), and Vouliagmeni (site of the triathlon venue). The upgrades to the Athens Metro were also completed, and the new lines became operational by mid-summer.\n\n\nEMI released *Unity*, the official pop album of the Athens Olympics, in the leadup to the Olympics.[16] It features contributions from Sting, Lenny Kravitz, Moby, Destiny's Child, and Avril Lavigne.[16] EMI has pledged to donate US$180,000 from the album to UNICEF's HIV/AIDS program in Sub-Saharan Africa.[16]\n\n\nAt least 14 people died during the work on the facilities. Most of these people were not from Greece.[17]\n\n\nBefore the Games, Greek hotel staff staged a series of one-day strikes over wage disputes. They had been asking for a significant raise for the period covering the event being staged. Paramedics and ambulance drivers also protested. They claimed to have the right to the same Olympic bonuses promised to their security force counterparts.\n\n\n\n## Torch relay[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The ceremony for the lighting of the flame was arranged as a pagan pageant, with dancing priestesses.\nMain article: 2004 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\n![](image)The Olympic Flame toured the world for the first time.\nThe lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame took place on 25 March 2004 in Ancient Olympia. For the first time ever, the flame travelled around the world in a relay to various Summer Olympic host cities (past and future) and other large cities, before returning to Greece.\n\n\n\n## Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Athena and Phevos\n\nMascots have been a tradition at the Olympic Games since the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France. The 2004 Olympics had two official mascots: *Athena* and *Phevos* (Greek pronunciation: Athina and Fivos). The sister and brother were named after Athena, the goddess of wisdom, strategy and war, and Phoebus, the god of light and music, respectively. They were inspired by the ancient daidala, which were toy dolls that also had religious connotations.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nAthens Olympic Broadcasting served as the host broadcaster for the Games, providing over 35,000 hours of coverage to over 300 television channels around the world. Local rights to the Games were held by ERT which devoted their three channels (ET1, NET and ET3) to more than 24 hours of Olympic coverage.[18]\n\n\n\n### Online coverage[edit]\n\n\nFor the first time, major broadcasters were allowed to serve video coverage of the Olympics over the Internet, provided that they restricted this service geographically, to protect broadcasting contracts in other areas.[19] The International Olympic Committee forbade Olympic athletes, as well as coaches, support personnel and other officials, from setting up specialized weblogs and/or other websites for covering their personal perspective of the Games. They were not allowed to post audio, video, or photos that they had taken. An exception was made if an athlete already has a personal website that was not set up specifically for the Games.[20] NBC launched its own Olympic website, NBCOlympics.com. Focusing on the television coverage of the Games, it did provide video clips, medal standings, live results. Its main purpose, however, was to provide a schedule of what sports were on the many stations of NBC Universal. The Games were shown on television 24 hours a day, on one network or another.\n\n\n\n## Technology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the ATHOC Technology Operations Center during the Games.\nAs with any enterprise, the Organizing Committee and everyone involved with it relied heavily on technology in order to deliver a successful event. ATHOC maintained two separate data networks, one for the preparation of the Games (known as the Administrative network) and one for the Games themselves (Games Network). The technical infrastructure involved more than 11,000 computers, over 600 servers, 2,000 printers, 23,000 fixed-line telephone devices, 9,000 mobile phones, 12,000 TETRA devices, 16,000 TV and video devices and 17 Video Walls interconnected by more than 6,000 kilometers of cabling (both optical fiber and twisted pair).\n\n\nThis infrastructure was created and maintained to serve directly more than 150,000 ATHOC Staff, Volunteers, Olympic family members (IOC, NOCs, Federations), Partners & Sponsors and Media. It also kept the information flowing for all spectators, TV viewers, Website visitors and news readers around the world, prior and during the Games. The Media Center was located inside the Zappeion which is a Greek national exhibition center.\n\n\nBetween June and August 2004, the technology staff worked in the Technology Operations Center (TOC) from where it could centrally monitor and manage all the devices and flow of information, as well as handle any problems that occurred during the Games. The TOC was organized in teams (e.g. Systems, Telecommunications, Information Security, Data Network, Staffing, etc.) under a TOC Director and corresponding team leaders (Shift Managers). The TOC operated on a 24x7 basis with personnel organized into 12-hour shifts.\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Olympic Flame at the opening ceremony\nMain article: 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n\nThe opening ceremony of the games, directed by choreographer Dimitris Papaioannou and produced by Jack Morton Worldwide, led by project director David Zolkwer, was held on 13 August 2004. It began with a twenty-eight (the number of the Olympiads up to then) second countdown paced by the sounds of an amplified heartbeat.[21] As the countdown was completed, fireworks rumbled and illuminated the skies overhead. After a drum corps and bouzouki players joined in an opening march, the video screen showed images of flight, crossing southwest from Athens over the Greek countryside to ancient Olympia. Then, a single drummer in the ancient stadium joined in a drum duet with a single drummer in the main stadium in Athens, joining the original ancient Olympic Games with the modern ones in symbolism. At the end of the drum duet, a single flaming arrow was launched from the video screen (symbolically from ancient Olympia) and into the reflecting pool, which resulted in fire erupting in the middle of the stadium creating a burning image of the Olympic rings rising from the pool. The Opening Ceremony was a pageant of traditional Greek culture and history hearkening back to its mythological beginnings. The program began as a young Greek boy sailed into the stadium on a 'paper-ship' waving the host nation's flag to aethereal music by Hadjidakis and then a centaur appeared, followed by a gigantic head of a cycladic figurine which eventually broke into many pieces symbolising the Greek islands. Underneath the cycladic head was a Hellenistic representation of the human body, reflecting the concept and belief in perfection reflected in Greek art. A man was seen balancing on a hovering cube symbolising man's eternal 'split' between passion and reason followed by a couple of young lovers playfully chasing each other while the god Eros was hovering above them. There followed a very colourful float parade chronicling Greek history from the ancient Minoan civilization to modern times.\n\n\nAlthough NBC in the United States presented the entire opening ceremony from start to finish, a topless Minoan priestess was shown only briefly, the breasts having been pixelated digitally in order to avoid controversy (as the \"Nipplegate\" incident was still fresh in viewer's minds at the time) and potential fines by the Federal Communications Commission. Also, lower frontal nudity of men dressed as ancient Greek statues was shown in such a way that the area below the waist was cut off by the bottom of the screen. Overall, NBC's coverage of the Olympics has been praised, and the company was awarded with 6 Emmy Awards for its coverage of the Games and technical production.[22][23] Additionally, NBC televised all 28 sports in the 2004 Games, becoming the first broadcaster to do so.[24]\n\n\nFollowing the artistic performances, a parade of nations entered the stadium with over 10,500 athletes walking under the banners of 201 nations. The nations were arranged according to Greek alphabet making the Philippines, Finland, Fiji, Chile, and Hong Kong the last five to enter the stadium before the Greek delegation. On this occasion, in observance of the tradition that the delegation of Greece opens the parade and the host nation closes it, the Greek flag bearer opened the parade and all the Greek delegation closed it. Based on audience reaction, the emotional high point of the parade was the entrance of the delegation from Afghanistan which had been absent from the Olympics and had female competitors for the first time. The Iraqi delegation also stirred emotions. Also recognized was the symbolic unified march of athletes from North Korea and South Korea under the Korean Unification Flag.[c] The country of Kiribati made its debut appearance at these Games and East Timor made a debut under its own flag. After the Parade of Nations, during which the Dutch DJ Tiësto provided the music, the Icelandic singer Björk performed the song \"Oceania\", written specially for the event by her and the poet Sjón.\n\n\nThe opening ceremony culminated in the lighting of the Olympic cauldron by 1996 gold medalist windsurfer Nikolaos Kaklamanakis. Many key moments in the ceremony, including the lighting of the Olympic Cauldron, featured music composed and arranged by New Zealander composer John Psathas.[25] The gigantic cauldron, which was styled after the Athens 2004 Olympic torch, pivoted down to be lit by the 35-year-old, before slowly swinging up and lifting the flame above the stadium. Following this, a fireworks display commenced to conclude the ceremony.\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Participating nations\n![](image)Team numbers\nAll National Olympic Committees (NOCs) except Djibouti participated in the Athens Games. Two new NOCs had been created since 2000 and made their debut at these Games (Kiribati and East Timor). Therefore, with the return of Afghanistan (who had been banned from the 2000 Summer Olympics), the number of participating nations increased from 199 to 201. Also since 2000, Yugoslavia had changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro and its code from YUG to SCG. Georgia's new flag made its debut at the Olympics by unfurling it at the opening ceremony on 13 August. It replaces the post-Soviet flag, which had been used since Lillehammer 1994.\n\n\nIn the table below, the number in parentheses indicates the number of participants contributed by each NOC.\n\n\n\n|

Officially there were 301 events in 28 sports as swimming, diving, synchronised swimming and water polo are classified by the IOC as disciplines within the sport of aquatics, and wheelchair racing was a demonstration sport. For the first time, the wrestling category featured women's wrestling and in the fencing competition women competed in the sabre. American Kristin Heaston, who led off the qualifying round of women's shot put became the first woman to compete at the ancient site of Olympia.\n\n\nThe demonstration sport of wheelchair racing was a joint Olympic/Paralympic event, allowing a Paralympic event to occur within the Olympics, and for the future, opening up the wheelchair race to the able-bodied. The 2004 Summer Paralympics were also held in Athens, from 17 to 28 September.\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2004 Summer Olympic Sports Programme\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *

Tunisia, a penalty taken by Tunisia had to be retaken five times.\n* Greek sprinters Konstantinos Kenteris and Ekaterini Thanou withdraw from the games after allegedly staging a motorcycle accident in order to avoid a drug test.\n* The shot put event was held in ancient Olympia, site of the ancient Olympic Games (this was the very first time women athletes competed in Ancient Olympia), while the archery competition and the men's and women's marathon finish were held in the Panathenaic Stadium, in which the 1896 Games were held.[27]\n* Kiribati and Timor Leste participated in the Olympic Games for the first time.[27]\n* Women's wrestling and women's sabre made their Olympic debut at the 2004 Games.[27]\n* With 6 gold, 6 silver, and 4 bronze medals, Greece had its best medal tally in over 100 years (since hosting the 1896 Olympics), continuing the nation's sporting success after winning Euro 2004 in July.\n* The marathon was held on the same route as the 1896 Games, beginning in the site of the Battle of Marathon to the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens.[27]\n* Australia became the first country in Olympic history to win more gold medals (17) immediately after hosting the Olympics in Sydney 2000 where they won 16 gold medals.\n* World record holder and strong favourite Paula Radcliffe crashed out of the women's marathon in spectacular fashion, leaving Mizuki Noguchi to win the gold.\n* While leading in the men's marathon with less than 10 kilometres to go, Brazilian runner Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima was attacked by Irish priest Neil Horan and dragged into the crowd. De Lima recovered to take bronze, and was later awarded the Pierre de Coubertin medal for sportsmanship.[27] Twelve years later, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics, he lit the Olympic Cauldron at Maracanã Stadium.\n* British athlete Kelly Holmes won gold in the 800 m and 1500 m.[27]\n* Liu Xiang won the first ever gold medal in men's track and field for China in the 110 m hurdles, equalling Colin Jackson's 1993 World Record time of 12.91 seconds.\n* Kenyan runners swept the medals in the 3000 meters steeple chase.[27]\n* The Olympics saw Afghanistan's first return to the Games since 1996 (it was banned due to the Taliban's extremist attitudes towards women, but was reinstated in 2002).\n* Hicham El Guerrouj wins gold in the 1500 m and 5000 m. He was the first person to accomplish this feat at the Olympics since Paavo Nurmi in 1924.[27]\n* Greek athlete Fani Halkia came out of retirement to win the 400 m hurdles.\n* The US women's 4×200 m swimming team of Natalie Coughlin, Carly Piper, Dana Vollmer and Kaitlin Sandeno won gold, smashing the long-standing world record set by the German Democratic Republic in 1987.\n* Argentina beat Italy 84–69 in the men's basketball final for their first gold medal in the sport.\n* Windsurfer Gal Fridman won Israel's first-ever gold medal.\n* Dominican athlete Félix Sánchez won the first ever gold medal for the Dominican Republic in the 400 m hurdles event.\n* German kayaker Birgit Fischer won gold in the K-4 500 m and silver in the K-2 500 m. In so doing, she became the first woman in any sport to win gold medals at 6 different Olympics, the first woman to win gold 24 years apart and the first person in Olympic history to win two or more medals in five different Games.\n* Swimmer Michael Phelps became the first athlete to win 8 medals (6 gold and 2 bronze) in non-boycotted Olympics.[27]\n* United States' gymnast Carly Patterson became the second American woman to win the all-around gold medal, and the first American woman to win the all-around competition at a non-boycotted Olympic Games.\n* Chilean Tennis players Nicolás Massu and Fernando Gonzalez won the gold medal in the Doubles Competition, while Massu won the gold and Gonzalez the bronze on the Singles competition. These were Chile's first-ever gold medals. With these victories, Massú became the thirteenth Tennis player (and the eighth male player) in history to have won the gold medal in both the Singles and Doubles Competition during the same Olympic Games. He also became the second Tennis player, and first male player, to have achieved this feat in modern Olympic Tennis (1988 onwards). The first player to do so was Venus Williams in 2000.[27]\n* Usain Bolt of Jamaica, in his first career Olympic Games, finished fifth in his 200m dash heat in 21.05 seconds, failing to qualify for the second round. In the years to come, he would go on to become the world's fastest man, with multiple world records in the 100m, 200m and 4×100m and a medal count of over 29 global medals, including 8 Olympic gold medals and 11 World Championships gold medals.\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Balloons falling at the Athens 2004 Olympics closing ceremony\nMain article: 2004 Summer Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe Games were concluded on 29 August 2004. The closing ceremony was held at the Athens Olympic Stadium, where the Games had been opened 16 days earlier. Around 70,000 people gathered in the stadium to watch the ceremony.\n\n\nThe initial part of the ceremony interspersed the performances of various Greek singers, and featured traditional Greek dance performances from various regions of Greece (Crete, Thessaly, etc.). The event was meant to highlight the pride of the Greeks in their culture and country for the world to see.\n\n\nA significant part of the closing ceremony was the exchange of the Olympic flag of the Athens Games between the mayor of Athens and the mayor of Beijing, host city of the next Olympics. After the flag exchange a presentation from the Beijing delegation presented a glimpse into Chinese culture for the world to see. Beijing University students (who were at first incorrectly cited as the Twelve Girls Band) sang Mo Li Hua (Jasmine Flower) accompanied by a ribbon dancer, then some male dancers did a routine with tai chi and acrobatics, followed by dancers from the Peking Opera and finally, a little Chinese girl singing a reprise of Mo Li Hua and concluded the presentation by saying \"Welcome to Beijing!\"\n\n\nThe medal ceremony for the last event of the Olympics, the men's marathon, was conducted, with Stefano Baldini from Italy as the winner. The bronze medal winner, Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima of Brazil, was simultaneously announced as a recipient of the Pierre de Coubertin medal for his bravery in finishing the race despite being attacked by a rogue spectator while leading with 7 km to go.\n\n\nA flag-bearer from each nation's delegation then entered along the stage, followed by the competitors *en masse* on the floor. All of them were led by Pyrros Dimas (weightlifter) and Liu Xiang (hurdler).\n\n\nShort speeches were presented by Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, President of the Organising Committee, and by President Dr. Jacques Rogge of the IOC, in which he described the Athens Olympics as \"unforgettable, dream Games\".[6]\n\n\nDr. Rogge had previously declared he would be breaking with tradition in his closing speech as President of the IOC and that he would never use the words of his predecessor Juan Antonio Samaranch, who used to always say 'these were the best ever games'.[6] Dr. Rogge had described Salt Lake City 2002 as \"superb games\" and in turn would continue after Athens 2004 and describe Turin 2006 as \"truly magnificent games.\"\n\n\nThe national anthems of Greece and China were played in a handover ceremony as both nations' flags were raised. The Mayor of Athens, Dora Bakoyianni, passed the Olympic Flag to the Mayor of Beijing, Wang Qishan. After a short cultural performance by Chinese actors, dancers, and musicians directed by eminent Chinese director Zhang Yimou, Rogge declared the 2004 Olympic Games closed. The Olympic flag was next raised again on 10 February 2006 during the opening ceremony of the next Winter Olympics in Torino.\n\n\nA young Greek girl, 10-year-old Fotini Papaleonidopoulou, lit a symbolic lantern with the Olympic Flame and passed it on to other children before \"extinguishing\" the flame in the cauldron by blowing a puff of air. The ceremony ended with a variety of musical performances by Greek singers, including Dionysis Savvopoulos, George Dalaras, Haris Alexiou, Anna Vissi, Sakis Rouvas, Eleftheria Arvanitaki, Alkistis Protopsalti, Antonis Remos, Michalis Hatzigiannis, Marinella, and Dimitra Galani, as thousands of athletes carried out symbolic displays on the stadium floor.\n\n\n\n## Medal count[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2004 Summer Olympics medal table\n\n![](image)Army Maj.

The pieces depict landmarks in Greece as well as ancient and modern sports on the obverse of the coin. On the reverse, a common motif with the logo of the Games, circled by an olive branch representing the spirit of the Games.\n\n\nPreparations to stage the Olympics led to a number of positive developments for the city's infrastructure. These improvements included the establishment of Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, a modern new international airport serving as Greece's main aviation gateway;[28] expansions to the Athens Metro[29] system; the \"Tram\", a new metropolitan tram (light rail) system[30] system; the \"Proastiakos\", a new suburban railway system linking the airport and suburban towns to the city of Athens; the \"Attiki Odos\", a new toll motorway encircling the city,[31] and the conversion of streets into pedestrianized walkways in the historic center of Athens which link several of the city's main tourist sites, including the Parthenon and the Panathenaic Stadium (the site of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896).[32][33] All of the above infrastructure is still in use to this day, and there have been continued expansions and proposals to expand Athens' metro, tram, suburban rail and motorway network, the airport, as well as further plans to pedestrianize more thoroughfares in the historic center of Athens.\n\n\nThe Greek Government has created a corporation, Olympic Properties SA, which is overseeing the post-Olympics management, development and conversion of these facilities, some of which will be sold off (or have already been sold off) to the private sector,[34][35] while some other facilities are still in use, or have been converted for commercial use or modified for other sports.[36]\n\n\nAs of 2012 many conversion schemes have stalled owing to the Greek government-debt crisis, though many of these facilities are now under the control of domestic sporting clubs and organizations or the private sector.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe table below delineates the current status of the Athens Olympic facilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Facility\n | Olympics use\n | Current/Proposed use\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Athens Olympic Stadium (OAKA)\n | Opening & Closing Ceremonies, Track & Field, Football\n | Home pitch for Panathinaikos FC,[37] AEK FC[38] (football; Greek Super League, UEFA Champions League), Greece national football team (some matches), International football competitions;[39] Track & Field events (e.g. IAAF Athens Grand Prix[40]), Concerts[41][42][43] |\n| Athens Olympic Indoor Hall | Basketball, Gymnastics\n | Home court for Panathinaikos BC[44] and AEK BC[45] (Greek basketball league); Greece men's national basketball team, International basketball competitions,[46] Concerts[47][48] |\n| Athens Olympic Aquatic Centre | Swimming, Diving, Synchronized Swimming, Water Polo\n | Domestic and international swimming meets,[49][50][51] Public pool,[52] domestic league and European water-polo games.\n |\n| Athens Olympic Tennis Centre | Tennis\n | Domestic and international tennis matches, training courts open to the public and home of the Athens Tennis Academy, currently the best-kept facility in the complex[53][54] |\n| Athens Olympic Velodrome | Cycling\n | Domestic and international cycling meets[55] |\n| Peace and Friendship Stadium | Volleyball\n | Home court for Olympiacos BC (basketball),[56] Concerts, Conventions and trade shows[57] |\n| Helliniko Olympic Indoor Arena | Basketball, Handball\n | Home court for Panionios BC (basketball),[58] Conventions and trade shows[52] |\n| Hellinikon Canoe/Kayak Slalom Centre | Canoe/Kayak\n | Turned over to a private consortium (J&P AVAX, GEP, Corfu Waterparks and BIOTER), plans to convert it to a water park,[59][60] although currently it is abandoned.\n |\n| Hellinikon Olympic Hockey Centre | Field Hockey\n | Mini-football, will be part of new Hellinikon metropolitan park complex[61] |\n| Hellinikon Baseball Stadium | Baseball\n | Main ground (no. 1) converted to football pitch, home field of Ethnikos Piraeus F.C.

Finally, popular arguments about \"rotting\" of many of the facilities, appear to ignore the actual utilization of most of these structures.[102][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2004 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Greece\n\t+ 1896 Summer Olympics – Athens\n\t+ 2004 Summer Olympics – Athens\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* List of 2004 Summer Olympics medal winners\n* Olympic records at the 2004 Summer Olympics\n* Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games – 2004 Athens\n* World records at the 2004 Summer Olympics\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The 2004 Olympic Games emblem is a wreath made from an olive tree branch, or kotinos. The emblem is a reference to the ancient Olympic Games, where the kotinos was the official award of Olympic champions. In addition, the olive was the sacred tree of Athens. The colours of the emblem symbolise the shades of white and blue found in the Greek countryside; Down below the word \"ATHENS 2004\" was put above the Olympic ring.\n2. **^** Standard Modern Greek pronunciation is [θeriˈni olibi.aˈci aˈɣonez ðˈio çiˈʎaðes ˈtesera].\n3. **^** The national teams of North Korea and South Korea competed separately in the Olympic events, even though they marched together as a unified Korean team in the opening ceremony. Later, in Beijing, the two Koreas marched separately.

These were also the second Summer Olympic Games to be held in a communist state, the first being the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union (with venues in Russia, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and Estonia).\n\n\nBeijing was awarded the 2008 Games over four competitors on 13 July 2001, having won a majority of votes from members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after two rounds of voting.[3] The Government of the People's Republic of China promoted the 2008 Games and invested heavily in new facilities and transport systems. 37 venues were used to host the events, including twelve constructed specifically for the 2008 Games. The equestrian events were held in Hong Kong, making these the third Olympics for which the events were held under the jurisdiction of two different NOCs.[d] The sailing events were contested in Qingdao, while the football events took place across several different cities.\n\n\nThe official logo for the 2008 Games, titled \"Dancing Beijing\" (舞动北京), created by Guo Chunning (郭春宁), featured the Chinese character for *capital* (京, stylized into the shape of a human being) in reference to the host city. The 2008 Olympics were watched by 3.5 billion people worldwide, and featured the longest distance for an Olympic Torch relay.[4][5] The 2008 Games also set numerous world and Olympic records, and were the most expensive Summer Olympics of all time, and the second most expensive overall, after the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi.[6][7] The opening ceremony was lauded by spectators and numerous international presses as spectacular, spellbinding, and by many accounts, \"the greatest ever in the history of Olympics\".[8][9][10] Beijing hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city ever to host both the Summer and Winter Games.\n\n\nAn unprecedented 87 countries won at least one medal during the 2008 Games. Host nation China won the most gold medals (48), and became the seventh different team to top an overall Summer Olympics medal tally, winning a total of 100 medals overall. The United States placed second in the gold medal tally but won the highest number of medals overall (112). The third place in the gold medal tally was achieved by Russia.\n\n\nThis Olympic Games marked the return of the Summer Olympic Games to Asia after the 1988 Olympics in South Korea. It was the first Olympics for Serbia as a separate state since 1912 and the first ever for Montenegro, having separated from Serbia in 2006. It was also the first Olympics for Nepal as a republic, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu. Mongolia and Panama each won their first ever Olympic gold medal. In addition, Afghanistan, Mauritius, Serbia, Sudan, Tajikistan and Togo won their first ever Olympic medals at these Games. North Korea, having symbolically marched with South Korea as one team at the opening ceremonies of the preceding three Games that it entered (2000 in Sydney, 2004 in Athens, and 2006 in Turin), paraded separately this time.\n\n\n\n\n## Organization[edit]\n\n\n### Bid[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2008 Summer Olympics\n\nUnder the direction of Liu Qi, Beijing was elected as the host city for the 2008 Summer Olympics on 13 July 2001, during the 112th IOC Session in Moscow, defeating bids from Toronto, Paris, Istanbul, and Osaka. Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC, but failed to make the short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. After the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the second round, Beijing was supported by a majority of voters, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds.[11] Toronto's bid was its fifth failure since 1960 (failed bids for 1960, 1964, 1976 and 1996 Games, losing to Rome, Tokyo, Montreal and Atlanta).[12]\n\n\nMembers of the IOC did not disclose their votes, but news reports speculated that broad international support led to China's selection, especially from developing nations that had received assistance from China to construct stadiums. The size of China, its increased enforcement of doping controls, and sympathy concerning its loss of the 2000 Summer Olympics to Sydney were all factors in the decision.[13] Eight years earlier, Beijing had led every round of voting for the 2000 Summer Olympics before losing to Sydney by two votes in the final round.[14]\n\n\nHuman rights concerns expressed by Amnesty International and politicians in both Europe and the United States were considered by the delegates, according to IOC Executive Director François Carrard. Carrard and others suggested that the selection might lead to improvements in human rights in China. In addition, many IOC delegates who had formerly been athletes expressed concern about heat and air quality during the Games, considering the high levels of air pollution in Beijing. China outlined plans to address these environmental concerns in its bid application.[13]\n\n\n\n\n\n2008 Summer Olympics bidding results\n| City\n | Nation\n | **Round 1** | **Round 2** |\n| Beijing | ![](image) China | **44** | **56** |\n| Toronto | ![](image) Canada | 20\n | 22\n |\n| Paris | ![](image) France | 15\n | 18\n |\n| Istanbul | ![](image) Turkey | 17\n | 9\n |\n| Osaka | ![](image) Japan | 6\n | —\n |\n\n\n### Costs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic Green, from above\n![](image)Beijing National Stadium, or \"Bird's Nest\"\n![](image)National Aquatics Center or \"Water Cuber\"\n![](image)National Indoor Stadium\n![](image)Wukesong Indoor Stadium\nOn 6 March 2009, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games reported that total spending on the Games was \"generally as much as that of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games\", which was equivalent to about US$15 billion. They went on to claim that surplus revenues from the Games would exceed the original target of $16 million.[15] Other reports, however, estimated the total costs from $40 to $44 billion, which would make the Games \"far and away the most expensive ever\".[16][17][18] Its budget was later exceeded by the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, which suffered from major cost overruns; the 2014 Winter Olympics costed roughly US$50 billion in public funding.[19] The *Oxford Olympics Study 2016* estimates the outturn cost of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics at US$6.8 billion in 2015-dollars. This includes sports-related costs only, such as those incurred by the organizing committee or those incurred by the host city, country, and private investors to build structures required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs—those not directly related to staging the Games—are not included. The Beijing Olympics' cost of US$6.8 billion compares with costs of US$4.6 billion for Rio 2016 and US$15 billion for London 2012.[20]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2008 Summer Olympics venues, Olympic Green, and Beijing National Stadium\n\nBy May 2007 the construction of all 31 Beijing-based Olympic Games venues had begun.[21] The Chinese government renovated and constructed six venues outside Beijing, and constructed 59 training facilities. The largest structures built were the Beijing National Stadium, Beijing National Indoor Stadium, Beijing National Aquatics Center, Peking University Gymnasium, Olympic Green Convention Center, Olympic Green, and Beijing Wukesong Culture & Sports Center. Almost 85% of the construction budget for the six main venues was funded by $2.1 billion (RMB¥17.4 billion) in corporate bids and tenders. Investments were expected from corporations seeking ownership rights after the Olympics.[22] Some events were held outside Beijing, namely football in Qinhuangdao, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Tianjin; sailing in Qingdao; and, because of the \"uncertainties of equine diseases and major difficulties in establishing a disease-free zone\", the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong.[23] Some stadiums were built on the former site of hutong neighbourhoods, including Qianmen Subdistrict.[24]\n\n\nThe showpiece of the 2008 Summer Olympics was the Beijing National Stadium, nicknamed \"The Bird's Nest\" because of its nest-like skeletal structure. The stadium hosted both the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the athletics competition.[25] Construction of the venue began on 24 December 2003. The Guangdong Olympic Stadium was originally planned, constructed, and completed in 2001 to help host the Games, but a decision was made to construct a new stadium in Beijing.[26] In 2001, the city held a bidding process to select the best arena design. Several criteria were required of each design, including flexibility for post-Olympics use, a retractable roof, and low maintenance costs.[27] The entry list was narrowed to thirteen final designs.[28] The bird's nest model submitted by architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron in collaboration with Li Xinggang of China Architecture Design and Research Group (CADG) was selected as the top design by both a professional panel and by a broader audience during a public exhibition. The selection of the design became official in April 2003.[27] Construction of the stadium was a joint venture among the original designers, project architect Stefan Marbach, artist Ai Weiwei, and a group of CADG architects led by Li Xinggang. Its $423 million cost was funded by the state-owned corporate conglomerate CITIC and the Beijing State-Owned Assets Management Company.[27][29]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map of the Olympic venues in Beijing. Several expressways encircle the center of the city, providing for quick transportation around the city and between venues.\nTo prepare for Olympic visitors, Beijing's transportation infrastructure was expanded. Beijing's airport underwent a major renovation with the addition of the new Terminal 3, designed by architect Norman Foster.[30] Within the city itself, Beijing's subway was doubled in capacity and length, with the addition of seven lines and 80 stations to the previously existing four lines and 64 stations. Included in this expansion was a new link connecting to the city's airport. A fleet of thousands of buses, minibuses, and official cars transported spectators, athletes, and officials between venues.[31][32]\n\n\nIn an effort to improve air quality, the city placed restrictions on construction sites and gas stations and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing.[33] From 20 July through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternative days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3 million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4 million additional passengers per day.[34]\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n![](image)Inside Beijing National Stadium during the Games. Olympic cauldron in background.\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics emblem was known as Dancing Beijing. The emblem combined a traditional Chinese red seal and a representation of the calligraphic character for \"capital\" (京, also the second character of Beijing's Chinese name) with athletic features. The open arms of the calligraphic word symbolized the invitation from China to the world to share in its culture. IOC president Jacques Rogge was rather pleased with the emblem, saying, \"Your new emblem immediately conveys the awesome beauty and power of China which are embodied in your heritage and your people.\"[35]\n\n\nThe official motto for the 2008 Olympics was \"*One World, One Dream*\" (同一个世界 同一个梦想).[36] It called upon the whole world to join in the Olympic spirit and build a better future for humanity, and was chosen from over 210,000 entries submitted from around the world.[37] Following the announcement of the motto, the phrase was used by international advocates of Tibetan secession. Banners reading \"One World, One Dream, Free Tibet\" were unfurled from various structures around the globe in the lead up to the Beijing Olympics, such as from the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge and the Sydney Opera House in Australia.[38]\n\n\nThe mascots of Beijing 2008 were the five Fuwa, each of which represented both a color of the Olympic rings and a symbol of Chinese culture. In 2006, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games released pictograms of 35 Olympic disciplines (however, for some multidiscipline sports such as cycling, a single pictogram was released).[39][40] This set of sport icons was named *the beauty of seal characters*, because of each pictogram's likeness to Chinese seal script.[40]\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fuwa\n\nThe mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics were the Fuwa, created by Han Meilin (韩美林). The mascots consisted of Beibei, a fish, Jingjing, a panda, Huanhuan, an Olympic flame, Yingying, a Tibetan antelope, and Nini, a sand martin kite. When their Chinese characters are combined, they form 北京欢迎你, or \"Beijing Welcomes You\". A year before the Games in 2007, the 100-episode The Olympic Adventures of Fuwa featuring the mascots, was released.\n\n\n\n### Media coverage[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of 2008 Summer Olympics broadcasters\n\nThe 2008 Games were the first to be produced and broadcast entirely in high definition by the host broadcaster.[41] In comparison, American broadcaster NBC broadcast only half of the Turin 2006 Winter Olympics in HD.[42][43] In their bid for the Olympic Games in 2001, Beijing stated to the Olympic Evaluation Commission that there would be \"no restrictions on media reporting and movement of journalists up to and including the Olympic Games.\"[44] However, some media outlets claimed that organizers ultimately failed to live up to this commitment.[e]\n\n\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, 4.7 billion viewers worldwide tuned in to some of the television coverage, one-fifth larger than the 3.9 billion who watched the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. American broadcaster NBC produced only two hours of online streaming video for the 2006 Winter Games but produced approximately 2,200 hours of coverage for the 2008 Summer Games. CNN reported that, for the first time, \"live online video rights in some markets for the Olympics have been separately negotiated, not part of the overall 'broadcast rights.'\" The new media of the digital economy was said to be growing \"nine times faster than the rest of the advertising market.\"[46]\n\n\nThe international European Broadcasting Union (EBU) provided live coverage and highlights of all arenas only for certain territories on their website, Eurovisionsports.tv.[47] Many national broadcasters likewise restricted the viewing of online events to their domestic audiences.[48] The General National Copyright Administration of China announced that \"individual (*sic*) and websites will face fines as high as 100,000 yuan for uploading recordings of Olympic Games video to the internet\",[49] part of an extensive campaign to protect the pertinent intellectual property rights.[50][51] The Olympic Committee also set up a separate YouTube channel at Beijing 2008.[52]\n\n\n\n### Theme song[edit]\n\n\nThe theme song of the 2008 Summer Olympics was \"You and Me,\" which was composed by Chen Qigang, the musical director of the opening ceremony. It was performed during the opening ceremony by Chinese singer Liu Huan and British singer Sarah Brightman.[53][54] The theme song was originally going to be a song called \"So much love, so far away (Tanto amor, tan lejos)\" written by Cuban singer-songwriter Jon Secada and Peruvian singer-songwriter Gian Marco under production from Cuban producer Emilio Estefan Jr. from EMI.[55]\n\n\n\n## Torch relay[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2008 Olympic Torch in Vilnius, Lithuania\nMain articles: 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay and 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay route\n\nThe design of the 2008 Olympic Torch was based on traditional scrolls and used a traditional Chinese design known as the \"Propitious Clouds\" (祥云). The torch was designed to remain lit in 65 km/h (40 mph) winds, and in rain of up to 50 mm (2 in) per hour.[56]\n\n\nThe relay, with the theme \"Journey of Harmony\", was met with protests and demonstrations by pro-Tibet supporters throughout its journey. It lasted 130 days and carried the torch 137,000 km (85,000 mi)—the longest distance of any Olympic torch relay since the tradition began at the 1936 Berlin Games.[57][58] The torch relay was described as a \"public relations disaster\" for China by *USA Today*,[59] with protests against China's human rights record, particularly focused on Tibet. The IOC subsequently barred future Olympics organizers from staging international torch relays.[60]\n\n\nThe relay began 24 March 2008, in Olympia, Greece. From there, it traveled across Greece to Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, and then to Beijing, arriving on 31 March. From Beijing, the torch followed a route passing through every continent except Antarctica. The torch visited cities on the Silk Road, symbolizing ancient links between China and the rest of the world. A total of 21,880 torchbearers were selected from around the world by various organizations and entities.[61]\n\n\nThe international portion of the relay was problematic. The month-long world tour encountered wide-scale anti-Chinese protests. After trouble in London involving attempts by protesters to put out the flame, the torch was extinguished in Paris the following day.[62] The American leg in San Francisco on 9 April was altered without prior warning to avoid such disturbances, although there were still demonstrations along the original route.[63] The relay was further delayed and simplified after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake hit western China.[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)Route of the 2008 Olympic Torch Relay\nThe flame was carried to the top of Mount Everest[61] on a 108 km (67 mi) long \"highway\" scaling the Tibetan side of the mountain, built especially for the relay. The $19.7 million blacktop project spanned from Tingri County of Xigazê Prefecture to the Everest Base Camp.[65] In March 2008, China banned mountaineers from climbing its side of Mount Everest, and later persuaded the Nepalese government to close their side as well, officially citing environmental concerns.[66] It also reflected concerns by the Chinese government that Tibet activists might try to disrupt its plans to carry the Olympic torch up the world's tallest peak.[67]\n\n\nThe originally proposed route would have taken the torch through Taipei after leaving Vietnam and before heading for Hong Kong. However, the government of Taiwan (then led by the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party) objected to this proposal, claiming that this route would make the portion of the relay in Taiwan appear to be part of the torch's domestic journey through China, rather than a leg on the international route.[68] This dispute, as well as Chinese demands that the flag and the national anthem of the Republic of China be banned along the route led the government of Taiwan to reject the proposal that it be part of the relay route. The two sides of the Taiwan Strait subsequently blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.[69]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chronological summary of the 2008 Summer Olympics\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Participating nations  \nBlue = Participating for the first time. Green = Have previously participated. Yellow square is host city (Beijing)\n![](image)Team sizes\nAll but one of the 205 recognized National Olympic Committees (NOCs) that existed as of 2008[update] participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics, the exception being Brunei.[70] Three countries participated in the Olympic Games for their first time: the Marshall Islands, Montenegro and Tuvalu.[71]\n\n\nWhile not a full member recognized by the IOC and thus not allowed to compete formally in the Olympics, the Macau Sports and Olympic Committee sent a delegation to participate in the Wushu Tournament Beijing 2008, being the only unrecognized National Olympic Committee to have taken part in the 2008 Summer Olympics. It also coordinated efforts with the Chinese Olympic Committee to organize the torch relay through Macau.\n\n\nThe Marshall Islands and Tuvalu gained National Olympic Committee status in 2006 and 2007 respectively, and 2008 was the first Games in which they were eligible to participate.[72][73] The states of Serbia and Montenegro, which participated at the 2004 Games jointly as Serbia and Montenegro, competed separately for the first time since Serbia last participated in 1912. Montenegro made its debut appearance, as the Montenegrin Olympic Committee was accepted as a new National Olympic Committee in 2007.[73] Neighboring Kosovo, however, did not participate. After the declaration of independence in Kosovo, the IOC specified requirements that Kosovo needs to meet before being recognized by the IOC; most notably, it has to be recognized as independent by the United Nations.[74][75][76] However, it has since been recognised by the IOC in 2014 without fulfilling this criteria and made its debut in the 2016 games.[77]\n\n\nMore than 100 sovereigns, heads of state and heads of government as well as 170 Ministers of Sport attended the Beijing Olympic Games.[78]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Participating National Olympic Committees |\n| --- |\n| *

Olympic Committee.\nAthletes from the Republic of China (Taiwan) competed at the 2008 Games as Chinese Taipei (TPE) under the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag and used the National Banner Song as their official anthem. The participation of Taiwan was briefly in doubt because of disagreements over the name of their team in the Chinese language and concerns about Taiwan marching in the Opening Ceremony next to the special administrative region of Hong Kong. A compromise on the naming was reached, and Taiwan was referred to during the Games as \"Chinese Taipei,\" rather than \"Taipei, China,\" as the mainland China government had proposed. In addition, the Central African Republic was placed between Chinese Taipei and the Special Administrative Regions during the march of nations.[79]\n\n\nStarting in 2005, North Korea and South Korea held meetings to discuss the possibility of sending a united team to the 2008 Olympics.[80][81] The proposal failed, because of disagreements about how athletes would be chosen; North Korea was demanding a certain percentage representation for its athletes. A subsequent attempt to broker an agreement for the two nations to walk together during the March of Nations failed as well, despite their having done so during the 2000 and 2004 Games.[82]\n\n\nOn 24 July 2008, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned Iraq from competing in the 2008 Olympic Summer Games because of \"political interference by the government in sports.\"[83][84] The IOC reversed its decision five days later and allowed the nation to compete after a pledge by Iraq to ensure \"the independence of its national Olympics panel\" by instituting fair elections before the end of November. In the meantime, Iraq's Olympic Organization was to be run by \"an interim committee proposed by its national sports federations and approved by the IOC.\"[85]\n\n\n\nBrunei Darussalam was due to take part in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. However, they were disqualified on 8 August, having failed to register either of their two athletes.[86] The IOC spokeswoman Emmanuelle Moreau said in a statement that \"it is a great shame and very sad for the athletes who lose out because of the decision by their team not to register them. The IOC tried up until the last minute, midday Friday 8 August 2008, the day of the official opening, to have them register, but to no avail.\"[87] Brunei's Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports issued a press release stating that their decision not to participate was due to an injury to one of their athletes.[88]\n\n\nGeorgia announced on 9 August 2008, that it was considering withdrawing from the Beijing Olympic Games because of the 2008 South Ossetia war, but it went on to compete while the conflict was still ongoing.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Participation of athletes with disabilities[edit]\n\n\nSouth African swimmer Natalie du Toit, whose left leg was amputated following a motor scooter accident, qualified to compete at the Beijing Olympics. The five time gold medalist at the Athens Paralympics in 2004 made history by becoming the first amputee to qualify for the Olympic Games since Olivér Halassy in 1936. She was able to compete in the Olympics rather than the Paralympics because she does not use a prosthetic leg while swimming.[90] Polish athlete Natalia Partyka, who was born without a right forearm, competed in Table Tennis in the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Paralympic Games.[91]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe program for the Beijing Games was quite similar to that of the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. There were 28 sports and 302 events at the 2008 Games. Nine new events were held, including two from the new cycling discipline of BMX. Women competed in the 3,000-meter (9,843 ft) steeplechase for the first time. Open water swimming events for men and women, over the distance of 10 kilometers (6.2 mi), were added to the swimming discipline. Team events (men and women) in table tennis replaced the doubles events.[92] In fencing, the women's team foil and women's team saber replaced men's team foil and women's team épée.[f] Two sports were open only to men, baseball and boxing, while one sport and one discipline were open only to women, softball and synchronized swimming. Equestrian and mixed badminton are the only sports in which men and women compete together, although three events in the Sailing allowed the opportunity for both males and female participants. However, only male participants took part in all three events.[94][95]\n\n\nThe following were the 302 events in 28 sports that were contested at the Games. The number of events contested in each sport is indicated in parentheses (in sports with more than one discipline, as identified by the IOC,[96] these are also specified).\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2008 Summer Olympics Sports Programme\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * ![](image) Aquatics\n\t+ Diving (8)\n\t+ Swimming (34)\n\t+ Synchronized swimming (2)\n\t+ Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (4)\n* ![](image) Athletics (47)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* ![](image) Baseball (1)\n* ![](image) Basketball (2)\n* ![](image) Boxing (11)\n | * ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n* ![](image) Cycling\n\t+ BMX (2)\n\t+ Road (4)\n\t+ Track (10)\n\t+ Mountain bike (2)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n | * ![](image) Fencing (10)\n* ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n* ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (14)\n* ![](image) Modern pentathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Rowing (14)\n* ![](image) Sailing (11)\n | * ![](image) Shooting (15)\n* ![](image) Softball (1)\n* ![](image) Table tennis (4)\n* ![](image) Taekwondo (8)\n* ![](image) Tennis (4)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (15)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (11)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (7)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\nIn addition to the official Olympic sports, the Beijing Organizing Committee was given special dispensation by the IOC to run a wushu competition in tandem with the Games. The 2008 Beijing Wushu Tournament saw 128 athletes from 43 countries participate, with medals awarded in 15 separate events; however, these were not to be added to the official medal tally since Wushu was not on the official program of the 2008 Summer Olympics.[97]\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nIn the following calendar for the 2008 Summer Olympics, each blue box represents an event competition, such as a qualification round, on that day. The yellow boxes represent days during which medal-awarding finals for a sport were held. Each bullet in these boxes is an event final, the number of bullets per box representing the number of finals that were contested on that day. On the left, the calendar lists each sport with events held during the Games, and at the right how many gold medals were won in that sport. There is a key at the top of the calendar to aid the reader.[98]\n\n\n\n*All dates are Beijing Time (UTC+8)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

including 37 world records were set in various events at the Games. In swimming, sixty-five Olympic swimming records including 25 world records were broken due to the use of the LZR Racer, a specialized swimming suit developed by NASA and the Australian Institute of Sport.[99] Only two swimming Olympic records remained intact after the Games.\n\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n\n![](image)Opening Ceremony.\nBefore the event started, the People's Liberation Army Navy Band performed the *Welcome March* song as delegations of both IOC and the Chinese government, led by Jacques Rogge and Hu Jintao, entered Beijing National Stadium (The *Bird's Nest*).[100] The opening ceremony officially began at 8:00 pm China Standard Time (UTC+8) on 8 August 2008. The number 8 is associated with prosperity and confidence in Chinese culture, and the ceremonial start comprised a triple eight for the date and one extra for time (close to 08:08:08 pm).[101] The ceremony was co-directed by Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou and Chinese choreographer Zhang Jigang[102] and featured a cast of over 15,000 performers.[103] The ceremony lasted over four hours and was reported to have cost over US$100 million to produce.[104] UNGA President Miguel d’Escoto and leaders from 105 countries attended this ceremony.\n\n\n\n![](image)Ilias Iliadis led the Greek team into the Bird's Nest as the traditional first contingent.\n![](image)Yao Ming and Lin Hao led the host country.\nA rich assembly of ancient Chinese art and culture dominated the ceremony. It opened with the beating of Fou drums for the countdown. Subsequently, a giant scroll was unveiled and became the show's centerpiece. The official song of the 2008 Olympics, titled \"You and Me,\" was performed by Britain's Sarah Brightman and China's Liu Huan, on a large spinning rendition of the globe.[105] On the parade of nations section, the Greek team, which hosted the previous games, entered first in honour of its status as the Olympic birthplace. They were led by judoka Ilias Iliadis. Meanwhile, the Chinese team entered last as the host country, led by NBA's Houston Rockets superstar Yao Ming and earthquake survivor Lin Hao, who was just 9 years old. The last recipient in the Olympic Torch relay, former Chinese gymnast Li Ning ignited the cauldron, after being suspended into the air by wires and completing a lap of the National Stadium at roof height.[106]\n\n\n\n![](image)The lighting of the Olympic Cauldron.\n![](image)Chinese gymnast Li Ning after igniting the cauldron.\nThe opening ceremony was lauded by spectators and various international presses as \"spectacular\" and \"spellbinding\".[107] Hein Verbruggen, chairman of the IOC Coordination Commission for the XXIX Olympiad, called the ceremony \"a grand, unprecedented success.\"[108]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony concluded the Beijing Games on 24 August 2008. It began at 8:00 pm China Standard Time (UTC+8) and took place at the Beijing National Stadium.\n\n\nThe Ceremony included the handover of the Games from Beijing to London. Guo Jinlong, the Mayor of Beijing handed over the Olympic flag to the Mayor of London Boris Johnson, followed by a performance organized by London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. This presentation included performances by guitarist Jimmy Page and recording artist Leona Lewis. Footballer David Beckham was also featured during London's presentation.[109]\n\n\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nFurther information: List of 2008 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\n![](image)The reverse side of the medals of the 2008 Summer Olympics: silver (left), gold (center), bronze (right). Each medal has a ring of jade.\nOf the 204 nations that participated in the 2008 Games, 87 earned medals and 54 of those won at least one gold medal, both of these figures setting new records for Olympic Games.[110][111] There were 117 participating countries that did not win any medals. Athletes from China won the highest number of gold medals of any nation at these Games, with 48, thus making China the seventh nation to rank top in the medal table in the history of the modern Olympics, along with the United States (fifteen times), France (in 1900), Great Britain (in 1908), Germany (in 1936), the Soviet Union (six times), and the Unified Team (in 1992).[110]\n\n\nThe United States team won the most medals overall, with 112. Afghanistan,[112] Mauritius,[113] Sudan,[114] Tajikistan[115] and Togo[116] won their first ever Olympic medals. Mongolia (which previously held the record for most medals without a gold)[117] and Panama[118] won their first gold medals. Four members of the water polo team from Serbia won the first medal for their country under its new name, having previously won medals representing Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro.[119]\n\n\nAmerican swimmer Michael Phelps won a total of eight gold medals, more than any other athlete in a single Olympic Games, setting numerous world and Olympic records in the process.[110] Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt also set records in several different events, completing the 100 m final with a time of 9.69 seconds, beating his own previous world record.[120] Gymnast Nastia Liukin won the all-around gold medal in artistic gymnastics, becoming the third American female to do so, following in the footsteps of Mary Lou Retton in 1984 and Carly Patterson in 2004.[121]\n\n\nThese are the top ten nations that won medals in the 2008 Games\n\n\n  ‡   Changes in medal standings (see here).\n\n\n\n  \\*   Host nation (China)\n\n\n\n2008 Summer Olympics medal table| Rank | NOC | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) China\\*‡ | 48 | 22 | 30 | 100 |\n| 2 | ![](image) United States‡ | 36 | 39 | 37 | 112 |\n| 3 | ![](image) Russia‡ | 24 | 13 | 23 | 60 |\n| 4 | ![](image) Great Britain‡ | 19 | 13 | 19 | 51 |\n| 5 | ![](image) Germany‡ | 16 | 11 | 14 | 41 |\n| 6 | ![](image) Australia | 14 | 15 | 17 | 46 |\n| 7 | ![](image) South Korea‡ | 13 | 11 | 8 | 32 |\n| 8 | ![](image) Japan‡ | 9 | 8 | 8 | 25 |\n| 9 | ![](image) Italy‡ | 8 | 9 | 10 | 27 |\n| 10 | ![](image) France‡ | 7 | 16 | 20 | 43 |\n| 11–87 | Remaining NOCs | 108 | 146 | 167 | 421 |\n| Totals (87 entries) | 302 | 303 | 353 | 958 |\n\n\n### Podium sweeps[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Sport\n | Event\n | NOC\n | Gold\n | Silver\n | Bronze\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 August\n | Fencing | Women's saber | ![](image) United States | Mariel Zagunis | Sada Jacobson | Rebecca Ward |\n| 17 August\n | Athletics | Women's 100 meters | ![](image) Jamaica | Shelly-Ann Fraser | Sherone SimpsonKerron Stewart | *Not awarded* |\n| 17 August\n | Tennis | Women's singles | ![](image) Russia | Elena Dementieva | Dinara Safina | Vera Zvonareva |\n| 18 August\n | Athletics | Men's 400 meters hurdles | ![](image) United States | Angelo Taylor | Kerron Clement | Bershawn Jackson |\n| 21 August\n | Athletics | Men's 400 meters | ![](image) United States | LaShawn Merritt | Jeremy Wariner | David Neville |\n| 22 August\n | Table tennis | Women's singles | ![](image) China | Zhang Yining | Wang Nan | Guo Yue |\n| 23 August\n | Table tennis | Men's singles | ![](image) China | Ma Lin | Wang Hao | Wang Liqin |\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2008 Summer Olympics\n\n![A crowd of protesters in a street displays a banner reading \"Human Rights Abuse Cannot Co-exist with Beijing Olympics.\" Near the center of the image, a photographer holds a camera level with the banner while looking through the viewfinder.](image)The banner reads: \"Human Rights Abuse Cannot Co-exist with Beijing Olympics\", picture taken during the opening of the Human Rights Torch Relay event\nA variety of concerns over the Games, or China's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities, including claims that China violated its pledge to allow open media access,[122] various claims of human rights violations,[123][124] its alleged continuous support of repressive regimes (such as Zimbabwe, Myanmar, Sudan, and North Korea), air pollution in both the city of Beijing and environs,[125] proposed boycotts,[126] warnings of the possibility that the Beijing Olympics could be targeted by terrorist groups,[127] disruption from Tibetan separatist protesters,[128] and religious persecutions.[129]\n\n\nThere were also claims that several members of China's women's gymnastics team, including double gold medal winner He Kexin, were too young to compete under the International Gymnastics Federation's rules for Olympic eligibility, but all were exonerated after an official IOC investigation.[130][131][132]\n\n\nCollectively, the Beijing Olympics are associated with a variety of problematic topics: the ecological impact, residential displacement due to construction, treatment of migrant workers, the government's political stance on Tibet, etc.[133] In the lead-up to the Olympics, the government allegedly issued guidelines to the local media for their reporting during the Games: most political issues not directly related to the Olympics were to be downplayed; topics such as pro-Tibetan independence and East Turkestan movements were not to be reported on, as were food safety issues such as \"cancer-causing mineral water\".[134] As the 2008 Chinese milk scandal broke in September 2008, there was widespread speculation that China's desire for a perfect Games may have been a factor contributing towards the delayed recall of contaminated infant formula.[135][136]\n\n\nThe 2008 Olympics were hit by a number of doping scandals before and after the Games had commenced. Since seven Russian track and field stars were suspended just before the start of the Games for allegedly tampering with their urine samples, only five of the seven who were due to take part could participate. Eleven Greek weightlifters also failed tests in the run up to the Games and the entire Bulgarian weightlifting team had to withdraw after eleven of their weightlifters also failed tests. A small number of athletes from other nations also failed pre-Games tests.[137][138][139]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing 2008 cauldron in 2013\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics have been generally accepted by the world's media as a logistical success.[140][141] Many of the worst fears about the Games failed to materialize: no terrorists struck Beijing; no athlete protested at the podium (though Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian tossed his bronze medal in disgust over judging); and the air quality, despite being the worst in Olympics history, was not as bad as many had feared beforehand – due largely to favorable weather patterns.[142][143]\n\n\nMany in China viewed the Olympics as \"an affirmation of a single nationalistic dream\" and saw protests during the international torch relay as an insult to China.[144] The Games also bolstered domestic support for the Chinese government, and for the policies of the Communist Party, giving rise to concerns that the Olympics would give the state more leverage to suppress political dissent, at least temporarily.[145] Efforts to quell any unrest before and during the Games also contributed to a rapid expansion in the size and political clout of China's internal security forces, and this growth continued through the following years.[146] Reports also indicated that the Olympics boosted the political careers of pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong, as many Chinese gold medal winners campaigned on behalf of the pro-Beijing DAB during the 2008 election,[147] although any trend towards greater identification by Hong Kongers with Mainland China appears to have been short-lived.[148]\n\n\nSome sectors of the Beijing economy may have benefited from the influx of tourists. Other sectors such as manufacturing lost revenue because of plant closings related to the government's efforts to improve air quality. Four years after the Games, many of the specially constructed facilities were underused or even deserted.[149] It is generally expected by economists that there will be no lasting effects on Beijing's economy from the Games.[150] One 2009 study found that countries that host the Olympics experience a significant boost in trade, but this is also the case for countries which merely bid to host: \"The benefit, in other words, came from the signal that a country was open for business, not from the spending itself.\"[151]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2008 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in China\n\t+ 2008 Summer Olympics – Beijing\n\t+ 2014 Summer Youth Olympics – Nanjing\n\t+ 2022 Winter Olympics – Beijing\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* Doping at the Olympic Games – 2008 Beijing\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The official logo for the 2008 Summer Olympics, featuring a depiction of the Chinese pictogram \"京\", from the word **Beijing** (**北京**) representing a dancing human figure, in reference to the host city.

The fourth event is determined by a vote. In 2004, the three men's team events (foil, saber, épée) and the women's épée were held, so in 2008, both the women's foil and saber events, as well as the men's épée, were automatically selected. The fourth event, men's saber, was chosen over men's foil by a 45:20 vote.[93]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Factsheet - Opening Ceremony of the Games of the Olympiad\" (PDF) (Press release).

These were also the second Summer Olympic Games to be held in a communist state, the first being the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union (with venues in Russia, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and Estonia).\n\n\nBeijing was awarded the 2008 Games over four competitors on 13 July 2001, having won a majority of votes from members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after two rounds of voting.[3] The Government of the People's Republic of China promoted the 2008 Games and invested heavily in new facilities and transport systems. 37 venues were used to host the events, including twelve constructed specifically for the 2008 Games. The equestrian events were held in Hong Kong, making these the third Olympics for which the events were held under the jurisdiction of two different NOCs.[d] The sailing events were contested in Qingdao, while the football events took place across several different cities.\n\n\nThe official logo for the 2008 Games, titled \"Dancing Beijing\" (舞动北京), created by Guo Chunning (郭春宁), featured the Chinese character for *capital* (京, stylized into the shape of a human being) in reference to the host city. The 2008 Olympics were watched by 3.5 billion people worldwide, and featured the longest distance for an Olympic Torch relay.[4][5] The 2008 Games also set numerous world and Olympic records, and were the most expensive Summer Olympics of all time, and the second most expensive overall, after the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi.[6][7] The opening ceremony was lauded by spectators and numerous international presses as spectacular, spellbinding, and by many accounts, \"the greatest ever in the history of Olympics\".[8][9][10] Beijing hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city ever to host both the Summer and Winter Games.\n\n\nAn unprecedented 87 countries won at least one medal during the 2008 Games. Host nation China won the most gold medals (48), and became the seventh different team to top an overall Summer Olympics medal tally, winning a total of 100 medals overall. The United States placed second in the gold medal tally but won the highest number of medals overall (112). The third place in the gold medal tally was achieved by Russia.\n\n\nThis Olympic Games marked the return of the Summer Olympic Games to Asia after the 1988 Olympics in South Korea. It was the first Olympics for Serbia as a separate state since 1912 and the first ever for Montenegro, having separated from Serbia in 2006. It was also the first Olympics for Nepal as a republic, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu. Mongolia and Panama each won their first ever Olympic gold medal. In addition, Afghanistan, Mauritius, Serbia, Sudan, Tajikistan and Togo won their first ever Olympic medals at these Games. North Korea, having symbolically marched with South Korea as one team at the opening ceremonies of the preceding three Games that it entered (2000 in Sydney, 2004 in Athens, and 2006 in Turin), paraded separately this time.\n\n\n\n\n## Organization[edit]\n\n\n### Bid[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2008 Summer Olympics\n\nUnder the direction of Liu Qi, Beijing was elected as the host city for the 2008 Summer Olympics on 13 July 2001, during the 112th IOC Session in Moscow, defeating bids from Toronto, Paris, Istanbul, and Osaka. Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC, but failed to make the short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. After the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the second round, Beijing was supported by a majority of voters, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds.[11] Toronto's bid was its fifth failure since 1960 (failed bids for 1960, 1964, 1976 and 1996 Games, losing to Rome, Tokyo, Montreal and Atlanta).[12]\n\n\nMembers of the IOC did not disclose their votes, but news reports speculated that broad international support led to China's selection, especially from developing nations that had received assistance from China to construct stadiums. The size of China, its increased enforcement of doping controls, and sympathy concerning its loss of the 2000 Summer Olympics to Sydney were all factors in the decision.[13] Eight years earlier, Beijing had led every round of voting for the 2000 Summer Olympics before losing to Sydney by two votes in the final round.[14]\n\n\nHuman rights concerns expressed by Amnesty International and politicians in both Europe and the United States were considered by the delegates, according to IOC Executive Director François Carrard. Carrard and others suggested that the selection might lead to improvements in human rights in China. In addition, many IOC delegates who had formerly been athletes expressed concern about heat and air quality during the Games, considering the high levels of air pollution in Beijing. China outlined plans to address these environmental concerns in its bid application.[13]\n\n\n\n\n\n2008 Summer Olympics bidding results\n| City\n | Nation\n | **Round 1** | **Round 2** |\n| Beijing | ![](image) China | **44** | **56** |\n| Toronto | ![](image) Canada | 20\n | 22\n |\n| Paris | ![](image) France | 15\n | 18\n |\n| Istanbul | ![](image) Turkey | 17\n | 9\n |\n| Osaka | ![](image) Japan | 6\n | —\n |\n\n\n### Costs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic Green, from above\n![](image)Beijing National Stadium, or \"Bird's Nest\"\n![](image)National Aquatics Center or \"Water Cuber\"\n![](image)National Indoor Stadium\n![](image)Wukesong Indoor Stadium\nOn 6 March 2009, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games reported that total spending on the Games was \"generally as much as that of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games\", which was equivalent to about US$15 billion. They went on to claim that surplus revenues from the Games would exceed the original target of $16 million.[15] Other reports, however, estimated the total costs from $40 to $44 billion, which would make the Games \"far and away the most expensive ever\".[16][17][18] Its budget was later exceeded by the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, which suffered from major cost overruns; the 2014 Winter Olympics costed roughly US$50 billion in public funding.[19] The *Oxford Olympics Study 2016* estimates the outturn cost of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics at US$6.8 billion in 2015-dollars. This includes sports-related costs only, such as those incurred by the organizing committee or those incurred by the host city, country, and private investors to build structures required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs—those not directly related to staging the Games—are not included. The Beijing Olympics' cost of US$6.8 billion compares with costs of US$4.6 billion for Rio 2016 and US$15 billion for London 2012.[20]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2008 Summer Olympics venues, Olympic Green, and Beijing National Stadium\n\nBy May 2007 the construction of all 31 Beijing-based Olympic Games venues had begun.[21] The Chinese government renovated and constructed six venues outside Beijing, and constructed 59 training facilities. The largest structures built were the Beijing National Stadium, Beijing National Indoor Stadium, Beijing National Aquatics Center, Peking University Gymnasium, Olympic Green Convention Center, Olympic Green, and Beijing Wukesong Culture & Sports Center. Almost 85% of the construction budget for the six main venues was funded by $2.1 billion (RMB¥17.4 billion) in corporate bids and tenders. Investments were expected from corporations seeking ownership rights after the Olympics.[22] Some events were held outside Beijing, namely football in Qinhuangdao, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Tianjin; sailing in Qingdao; and, because of the \"uncertainties of equine diseases and major difficulties in establishing a disease-free zone\", the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong.[23] Some stadiums were built on the former site of hutong neighbourhoods, including Qianmen Subdistrict.[24]\n\n\nThe showpiece of the 2008 Summer Olympics was the Beijing National Stadium, nicknamed \"The Bird's Nest\" because of its nest-like skeletal structure. The stadium hosted both the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the athletics competition.[25] Construction of the venue began on 24 December 2003. The Guangdong Olympic Stadium was originally planned, constructed, and completed in 2001 to help host the Games, but a decision was made to construct a new stadium in Beijing.[26] In 2001, the city held a bidding process to select the best arena design. Several criteria were required of each design, including flexibility for post-Olympics use, a retractable roof, and low maintenance costs.[27] The entry list was narrowed to thirteen final designs.[28] The bird's nest model submitted by architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron in collaboration with Li Xinggang of China Architecture Design and Research Group (CADG) was selected as the top design by both a professional panel and by a broader audience during a public exhibition. The selection of the design became official in April 2003.[27] Construction of the stadium was a joint venture among the original designers, project architect Stefan Marbach, artist Ai Weiwei, and a group of CADG architects led by Li Xinggang. Its $423 million cost was funded by the state-owned corporate conglomerate CITIC and the Beijing State-Owned Assets Management Company.[27][29]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map of the Olympic venues in Beijing. Several expressways encircle the center of the city, providing for quick transportation around the city and between venues.\nTo prepare for Olympic visitors, Beijing's transportation infrastructure was expanded. Beijing's airport underwent a major renovation with the addition of the new Terminal 3, designed by architect Norman Foster.[30] Within the city itself, Beijing's subway was doubled in capacity and length, with the addition of seven lines and 80 stations to the previously existing four lines and 64 stations. Included in this expansion was a new link connecting to the city's airport. A fleet of thousands of buses, minibuses, and official cars transported spectators, athletes, and officials between venues.[31][32]\n\n\nIn an effort to improve air quality, the city placed restrictions on construction sites and gas stations and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing.[33] From 20 July through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternative days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3 million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4 million additional passengers per day.[34]\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n![](image)Inside Beijing National Stadium during the Games. Olympic cauldron in background.\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics emblem was known as Dancing Beijing. The emblem combined a traditional Chinese red seal and a representation of the calligraphic character for \"capital\" (京, also the second character of Beijing's Chinese name) with athletic features. The open arms of the calligraphic word symbolized the invitation from China to the world to share in its culture. IOC president Jacques Rogge was rather pleased with the emblem, saying, \"Your new emblem immediately conveys the awesome beauty and power of China which are embodied in your heritage and your people.\"[35]\n\n\nThe official motto for the 2008 Olympics was \"*One World, One Dream*\" (同一个世界 同一个梦想).[36] It called upon the whole world to join in the Olympic spirit and build a better future for humanity, and was chosen from over 210,000 entries submitted from around the world.[37] Following the announcement of the motto, the phrase was used by international advocates of Tibetan secession. Banners reading \"One World, One Dream, Free Tibet\" were unfurled from various structures around the globe in the lead up to the Beijing Olympics, such as from the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge and the Sydney Opera House in Australia.[38]\n\n\nThe mascots of Beijing 2008 were the five Fuwa, each of which represented both a color of the Olympic rings and a symbol of Chinese culture. In 2006, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games released pictograms of 35 Olympic disciplines (however, for some multidiscipline sports such as cycling, a single pictogram was released).[39][40] This set of sport icons was named *the beauty of seal characters*, because of each pictogram's likeness to Chinese seal script.[40]\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fuwa\n\nThe mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics were the Fuwa, created by Han Meilin (韩美林). The mascots consisted of Beibei, a fish, Jingjing, a panda, Huanhuan, an Olympic flame, Yingying, a Tibetan antelope, and Nini, a sand martin kite. When their Chinese characters are combined, they form 北京欢迎你, or \"Beijing Welcomes You\". A year before the Games in 2007, the 100-episode The Olympic Adventures of Fuwa featuring the mascots, was released.\n\n\n\n### Media coverage[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of 2008 Summer Olympics broadcasters\n\nThe 2008 Games were the first to be produced and broadcast entirely in high definition by the host broadcaster.[41] In comparison, American broadcaster NBC broadcast only half of the Turin 2006 Winter Olympics in HD.[42][43] In their bid for the Olympic Games in 2001, Beijing stated to the Olympic Evaluation Commission that there would be \"no restrictions on media reporting and movement of journalists up to and including the Olympic Games.\"[44] However, some media outlets claimed that organizers ultimately failed to live up to this commitment.[e]\n\n\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, 4.7 billion viewers worldwide tuned in to some of the television coverage, one-fifth larger than the 3.9 billion who watched the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. American broadcaster NBC produced only two hours of online streaming video for the 2006 Winter Games but produced approximately 2,200 hours of coverage for the 2008 Summer Games. CNN reported that, for the first time, \"live online video rights in some markets for the Olympics have been separately negotiated, not part of the overall 'broadcast rights.'\" The new media of the digital economy was said to be growing \"nine times faster than the rest of the advertising market.\"[46]\n\n\nThe international European Broadcasting Union (EBU) provided live coverage and highlights of all arenas only for certain territories on their website, Eurovisionsports.tv.[47] Many national broadcasters likewise restricted the viewing of online events to their domestic audiences.[48] The General National Copyright Administration of China announced that \"individual (*sic*) and websites will face fines as high as 100,000 yuan for uploading recordings of Olympic Games video to the internet\",[49] part of an extensive campaign to protect the pertinent intellectual property rights.[50][51] The Olympic Committee also set up a separate YouTube channel at Beijing 2008.[52]\n\n\n\n### Theme song[edit]\n\n\nThe theme song of the 2008 Summer Olympics was \"You and Me,\" which was composed by Chen Qigang, the musical director of the opening ceremony. It was performed during the opening ceremony by Chinese singer Liu Huan and British singer Sarah Brightman.[53][54] The theme song was originally going to be a song called \"So much love, so far away (Tanto amor, tan lejos)\" written by Cuban singer-songwriter Jon Secada and Peruvian singer-songwriter Gian Marco under production from Cuban producer Emilio Estefan Jr. from EMI.[55]\n\n\n\n## Torch relay[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2008 Olympic Torch in Vilnius, Lithuania\nMain articles: 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay and 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay route\n\nThe design of the 2008 Olympic Torch was based on traditional scrolls and used a traditional Chinese design known as the \"Propitious Clouds\" (祥云). The torch was designed to remain lit in 65 km/h (40 mph) winds, and in rain of up to 50 mm (2 in) per hour.[56]\n\n\nThe relay, with the theme \"Journey of Harmony\", was met with protests and demonstrations by pro-Tibet supporters throughout its journey. It lasted 130 days and carried the torch 137,000 km (85,000 mi)—the longest distance of any Olympic torch relay since the tradition began at the 1936 Berlin Games.[57][58] The torch relay was described as a \"public relations disaster\" for China by *USA Today*,[59] with protests against China's human rights record, particularly focused on Tibet. The IOC subsequently barred future Olympics organizers from staging international torch relays.[60]\n\n\nThe relay began 24 March 2008, in Olympia, Greece. From there, it traveled across Greece to Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, and then to Beijing, arriving on 31 March. From Beijing, the torch followed a route passing through every continent except Antarctica. The torch visited cities on the Silk Road, symbolizing ancient links between China and the rest of the world. A total of 21,880 torchbearers were selected from around the world by various organizations and entities.[61]\n\n\nThe international portion of the relay was problematic. The month-long world tour encountered wide-scale anti-Chinese protests. After trouble in London involving attempts by protesters to put out the flame, the torch was extinguished in Paris the following day.[62] The American leg in San Francisco on 9 April was altered without prior warning to avoid such disturbances, although there were still demonstrations along the original route.[63] The relay was further delayed and simplified after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake hit western China.[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)Route of the 2008 Olympic Torch Relay\nThe flame was carried to the top of Mount Everest[61] on a 108 km (67 mi) long \"highway\" scaling the Tibetan side of the mountain, built especially for the relay. The $19.7 million blacktop project spanned from Tingri County of Xigazê Prefecture to the Everest Base Camp.[65] In March 2008, China banned mountaineers from climbing its side of Mount Everest, and later persuaded the Nepalese government to close their side as well, officially citing environmental concerns.[66] It also reflected concerns by the Chinese government that Tibet activists might try to disrupt its plans to carry the Olympic torch up the world's tallest peak.[67]\n\n\nThe originally proposed route would have taken the torch through Taipei after leaving Vietnam and before heading for Hong Kong. However, the government of Taiwan (then led by the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party) objected to this proposal, claiming that this route would make the portion of the relay in Taiwan appear to be part of the torch's domestic journey through China, rather than a leg on the international route.[68] This dispute, as well as Chinese demands that the flag and the national anthem of the Republic of China be banned along the route led the government of Taiwan to reject the proposal that it be part of the relay route. The two sides of the Taiwan Strait subsequently blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.[69]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chronological summary of the 2008 Summer Olympics\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Participating nations  \nBlue = Participating for the first time. Green = Have previously participated. Yellow square is host city (Beijing)\n![](image)Team sizes\nAll but one of the 205 recognized National Olympic Committees (NOCs) that existed as of 2008[update] participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics, the exception being Brunei.[70] Three countries participated in the Olympic Games for their first time: the Marshall Islands, Montenegro and Tuvalu.[71]\n\n\nWhile not a full member recognized by the IOC and thus not allowed to compete formally in the Olympics, the Macau Sports and Olympic Committee sent a delegation to participate in the Wushu Tournament Beijing 2008, being the only unrecognized National Olympic Committee to have taken part in the 2008 Summer Olympics. It also coordinated efforts with the Chinese Olympic Committee to organize the torch relay through Macau.\n\n\nThe Marshall Islands and Tuvalu gained National Olympic Committee status in 2006 and 2007 respectively, and 2008 was the first Games in which they were eligible to participate.[72][73] The states of Serbia and Montenegro, which participated at the 2004 Games jointly as Serbia and Montenegro, competed separately for the first time since Serbia last participated in 1912. Montenegro made its debut appearance, as the Montenegrin Olympic Committee was accepted as a new National Olympic Committee in 2007.[73] Neighboring Kosovo, however, did not participate. After the declaration of independence in Kosovo, the IOC specified requirements that Kosovo needs to meet before being recognized by the IOC; most notably, it has to be recognized as independent by the United Nations.[74][75][76] However, it has since been recognised by the IOC in 2014 without fulfilling this criteria and made its debut in the 2016 games.[77]\n\n\nMore than 100 sovereigns, heads of state and heads of government as well as 170 Ministers of Sport attended the Beijing Olympic Games.[78]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Participating National Olympic Committees |\n| --- |\n| *

Olympic Committee.\nAthletes from the Republic of China (Taiwan) competed at the 2008 Games as Chinese Taipei (TPE) under the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag and used the National Banner Song as their official anthem. The participation of Taiwan was briefly in doubt because of disagreements over the name of their team in the Chinese language and concerns about Taiwan marching in the Opening Ceremony next to the special administrative region of Hong Kong. A compromise on the naming was reached, and Taiwan was referred to during the Games as \"Chinese Taipei,\" rather than \"Taipei, China,\" as the mainland China government had proposed. In addition, the Central African Republic was placed between Chinese Taipei and the Special Administrative Regions during the march of nations.[79]\n\n\nStarting in 2005, North Korea and South Korea held meetings to discuss the possibility of sending a united team to the 2008 Olympics.[80][81] The proposal failed, because of disagreements about how athletes would be chosen; North Korea was demanding a certain percentage representation for its athletes. A subsequent attempt to broker an agreement for the two nations to walk together during the March of Nations failed as well, despite their having done so during the 2000 and 2004 Games.[82]\n\n\nOn 24 July 2008, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned Iraq from competing in the 2008 Olympic Summer Games because of \"political interference by the government in sports.\"[83][84] The IOC reversed its decision five days later and allowed the nation to compete after a pledge by Iraq to ensure \"the independence of its national Olympics panel\" by instituting fair elections before the end of November. In the meantime, Iraq's Olympic Organization was to be run by \"an interim committee proposed by its national sports federations and approved by the IOC.\"[85]\n\n\n\nBrunei Darussalam was due to take part in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. However, they were disqualified on 8 August, having failed to register either of their two athletes.[86] The IOC spokeswoman Emmanuelle Moreau said in a statement that \"it is a great shame and very sad for the athletes who lose out because of the decision by their team not to register them. The IOC tried up until the last minute, midday Friday 8 August 2008, the day of the official opening, to have them register, but to no avail.\"[87] Brunei's Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports issued a press release stating that their decision not to participate was due to an injury to one of their athletes.[88]\n\n\nGeorgia announced on 9 August 2008, that it was considering withdrawing from the Beijing Olympic Games because of the 2008 South Ossetia war, but it went on to compete while the conflict was still ongoing.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Participation of athletes with disabilities[edit]\n\n\nSouth African swimmer Natalie du Toit, whose left leg was amputated following a motor scooter accident, qualified to compete at the Beijing Olympics. The five time gold medalist at the Athens Paralympics in 2004 made history by becoming the first amputee to qualify for the Olympic Games since Olivér Halassy in 1936. She was able to compete in the Olympics rather than the Paralympics because she does not use a prosthetic leg while swimming.[90] Polish athlete Natalia Partyka, who was born without a right forearm, competed in Table Tennis in the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Paralympic Games.[91]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe program for the Beijing Games was quite similar to that of the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. There were 28 sports and 302 events at the 2008 Games. Nine new events were held, including two from the new cycling discipline of BMX. Women competed in the 3,000-meter (9,843 ft) steeplechase for the first time. Open water swimming events for men and women, over the distance of 10 kilometers (6.2 mi), were added to the swimming discipline. Team events (men and women) in table tennis replaced the doubles events.[92] In fencing, the women's team foil and women's team saber replaced men's team foil and women's team épée.[f] Two sports were open only to men, baseball and boxing, while one sport and one discipline were open only to women, softball and synchronized swimming. Equestrian and mixed badminton are the only sports in which men and women compete together, although three events in the Sailing allowed the opportunity for both males and female participants. However, only male participants took part in all three events.[94][95]\n\n\nThe following were the 302 events in 28 sports that were contested at the Games. The number of events contested in each sport is indicated in parentheses (in sports with more than one discipline, as identified by the IOC,[96] these are also specified).\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2008 Summer Olympics Sports Programme\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * ![](image) Aquatics\n\t+ Diving (8)\n\t+ Swimming (34)\n\t+ Synchronized swimming (2)\n\t+ Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (4)\n* ![](image) Athletics (47)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* ![](image) Baseball (1)\n* ![](image) Basketball (2)\n* ![](image) Boxing (11)\n | * ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n* ![](image) Cycling\n\t+ BMX (2)\n\t+ Road (4)\n\t+ Track (10)\n\t+ Mountain bike (2)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n | * ![](image) Fencing (10)\n* ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n* ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (14)\n* ![](image) Modern pentathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Rowing (14)\n* ![](image) Sailing (11)\n | * ![](image) Shooting (15)\n* ![](image) Softball (1)\n* ![](image) Table tennis (4)\n* ![](image) Taekwondo (8)\n* ![](image) Tennis (4)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (15)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (11)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (7)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\nIn addition to the official Olympic sports, the Beijing Organizing Committee was given special dispensation by the IOC to run a wushu competition in tandem with the Games. The 2008 Beijing Wushu Tournament saw 128 athletes from 43 countries participate, with medals awarded in 15 separate events; however, these were not to be added to the official medal tally since Wushu was not on the official program of the 2008 Summer Olympics.[97]\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nIn the following calendar for the 2008 Summer Olympics, each blue box represents an event competition, such as a qualification round, on that day. The yellow boxes represent days during which medal-awarding finals for a sport were held. Each bullet in these boxes is an event final, the number of bullets per box representing the number of finals that were contested on that day. On the left, the calendar lists each sport with events held during the Games, and at the right how many gold medals were won in that sport. There is a key at the top of the calendar to aid the reader.[98]\n\n\n\n*All dates are Beijing Time (UTC+8)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

including 37 world records were set in various events at the Games. In swimming, sixty-five Olympic swimming records including 25 world records were broken due to the use of the LZR Racer, a specialized swimming suit developed by NASA and the Australian Institute of Sport.[99] Only two swimming Olympic records remained intact after the Games.\n\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n\n![](image)Opening Ceremony.\nBefore the event started, the People's Liberation Army Navy Band performed the *Welcome March* song as delegations of both IOC and the Chinese government, led by Jacques Rogge and Hu Jintao, entered Beijing National Stadium (The *Bird's Nest*).[100] The opening ceremony officially began at 8:00 pm China Standard Time (UTC+8) on 8 August 2008. The number 8 is associated with prosperity and confidence in Chinese culture, and the ceremonial start comprised a triple eight for the date and one extra for time (close to 08:08:08 pm).[101] The ceremony was co-directed by Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou and Chinese choreographer Zhang Jigang[102] and featured a cast of over 15,000 performers.[103] The ceremony lasted over four hours and was reported to have cost over US$100 million to produce.[104] UNGA President Miguel d’Escoto and leaders from 105 countries attended this ceremony.\n\n\n\n![](image)Ilias Iliadis led the Greek team into the Bird's Nest as the traditional first contingent.\n![](image)Yao Ming and Lin Hao led the host country.\nA rich assembly of ancient Chinese art and culture dominated the ceremony. It opened with the beating of Fou drums for the countdown. Subsequently, a giant scroll was unveiled and became the show's centerpiece. The official song of the 2008 Olympics, titled \"You and Me,\" was performed by Britain's Sarah Brightman and China's Liu Huan, on a large spinning rendition of the globe.[105] On the parade of nations section, the Greek team, which hosted the previous games, entered first in honour of its status as the Olympic birthplace. They were led by judoka Ilias Iliadis. Meanwhile, the Chinese team entered last as the host country, led by NBA's Houston Rockets superstar Yao Ming and earthquake survivor Lin Hao, who was just 9 years old. The last recipient in the Olympic Torch relay, former Chinese gymnast Li Ning ignited the cauldron, after being suspended into the air by wires and completing a lap of the National Stadium at roof height.[106]\n\n\n\n![](image)The lighting of the Olympic Cauldron.\n![](image)Chinese gymnast Li Ning after igniting the cauldron.\nThe opening ceremony was lauded by spectators and various international presses as \"spectacular\" and \"spellbinding\".[107] Hein Verbruggen, chairman of the IOC Coordination Commission for the XXIX Olympiad, called the ceremony \"a grand, unprecedented success.\"[108]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony concluded the Beijing Games on 24 August 2008. It began at 8:00 pm China Standard Time (UTC+8) and took place at the Beijing National Stadium.\n\n\nThe Ceremony included the handover of the Games from Beijing to London. Guo Jinlong, the Mayor of Beijing handed over the Olympic flag to the Mayor of London Boris Johnson, followed by a performance organized by London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. This presentation included performances by guitarist Jimmy Page and recording artist Leona Lewis. Footballer David Beckham was also featured during London's presentation.[109]\n\n\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nFurther information: List of 2008 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\n![](image)The reverse side of the medals of the 2008 Summer Olympics: silver (left), gold (center), bronze (right). Each medal has a ring of jade.\nOf the 204 nations that participated in the 2008 Games, 87 earned medals and 54 of those won at least one gold medal, both of these figures setting new records for Olympic Games.[110][111] There were 117 participating countries that did not win any medals. Athletes from China won the highest number of gold medals of any nation at these Games, with 48, thus making China the seventh nation to rank top in the medal table in the history of the modern Olympics, along with the United States (fifteen times), France (in 1900), Great Britain (in 1908), Germany (in 1936), the Soviet Union (six times), and the Unified Team (in 1992).[110]\n\n\nThe United States team won the most medals overall, with 112. Afghanistan,[112] Mauritius,[113] Sudan,[114] Tajikistan[115] and Togo[116] won their first ever Olympic medals. Mongolia (which previously held the record for most medals without a gold)[117] and Panama[118] won their first gold medals. Four members of the water polo team from Serbia won the first medal for their country under its new name, having previously won medals representing Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro.[119]\n\n\nAmerican swimmer Michael Phelps won a total of eight gold medals, more than any other athlete in a single Olympic Games, setting numerous world and Olympic records in the process.[110] Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt also set records in several different events, completing the 100 m final with a time of 9.69 seconds, beating his own previous world record.[120] Gymnast Nastia Liukin won the all-around gold medal in artistic gymnastics, becoming the third American female to do so, following in the footsteps of Mary Lou Retton in 1984 and Carly Patterson in 2004.[121]\n\n\nThese are the top ten nations that won medals in the 2008 Games\n\n\n  ‡   Changes in medal standings (see here).\n\n\n\n  \\*   Host nation (China)\n\n\n\n2008 Summer Olympics medal table| Rank | NOC | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) China\\*‡ | 48 | 22 | 30 | 100 |\n| 2 | ![](image) United States‡ | 36 | 39 | 37 | 112 |\n| 3 | ![](image) Russia‡ | 24 | 13 | 23 | 60 |\n| 4 | ![](image) Great Britain‡ | 19 | 13 | 19 | 51 |\n| 5 | ![](image) Germany‡ | 16 | 11 | 14 | 41 |\n| 6 | ![](image) Australia | 14 | 15 | 17 | 46 |\n| 7 | ![](image) South Korea‡ | 13 | 11 | 8 | 32 |\n| 8 | ![](image) Japan‡ | 9 | 8 | 8 | 25 |\n| 9 | ![](image) Italy‡ | 8 | 9 | 10 | 27 |\n| 10 | ![](image) France‡ | 7 | 16 | 20 | 43 |\n| 11–87 | Remaining NOCs | 108 | 146 | 167 | 421 |\n| Totals (87 entries) | 302 | 303 | 353 | 958 |\n\n\n### Podium sweeps[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Sport\n | Event\n | NOC\n | Gold\n | Silver\n | Bronze\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 August\n | Fencing | Women's saber | ![](image) United States | Mariel Zagunis | Sada Jacobson | Rebecca Ward |\n| 17 August\n | Athletics | Women's 100 meters | ![](image) Jamaica | Shelly-Ann Fraser | Sherone SimpsonKerron Stewart | *Not awarded* |\n| 17 August\n | Tennis | Women's singles | ![](image) Russia | Elena Dementieva | Dinara Safina | Vera Zvonareva |\n| 18 August\n | Athletics | Men's 400 meters hurdles | ![](image) United States | Angelo Taylor | Kerron Clement | Bershawn Jackson |\n| 21 August\n | Athletics | Men's 400 meters | ![](image) United States | LaShawn Merritt | Jeremy Wariner | David Neville |\n| 22 August\n | Table tennis | Women's singles | ![](image) China | Zhang Yining | Wang Nan | Guo Yue |\n| 23 August\n | Table tennis | Men's singles | ![](image) China | Ma Lin | Wang Hao | Wang Liqin |\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2008 Summer Olympics\n\n![A crowd of protesters in a street displays a banner reading \"Human Rights Abuse Cannot Co-exist with Beijing Olympics.\" Near the center of the image, a photographer holds a camera level with the banner while looking through the viewfinder.](image)The banner reads: \"Human Rights Abuse Cannot Co-exist with Beijing Olympics\", picture taken during the opening of the Human Rights Torch Relay event\nA variety of concerns over the Games, or China's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities, including claims that China violated its pledge to allow open media access,[122] various claims of human rights violations,[123][124] its alleged continuous support of repressive regimes (such as Zimbabwe, Myanmar, Sudan, and North Korea), air pollution in both the city of Beijing and environs,[125] proposed boycotts,[126] warnings of the possibility that the Beijing Olympics could be targeted by terrorist groups,[127] disruption from Tibetan separatist protesters,[128] and religious persecutions.[129]\n\n\nThere were also claims that several members of China's women's gymnastics team, including double gold medal winner He Kexin, were too young to compete under the International Gymnastics Federation's rules for Olympic eligibility, but all were exonerated after an official IOC investigation.[130][131][132]\n\n\nCollectively, the Beijing Olympics are associated with a variety of problematic topics: the ecological impact, residential displacement due to construction, treatment of migrant workers, the government's political stance on Tibet, etc.[133] In the lead-up to the Olympics, the government allegedly issued guidelines to the local media for their reporting during the Games: most political issues not directly related to the Olympics were to be downplayed; topics such as pro-Tibetan independence and East Turkestan movements were not to be reported on, as were food safety issues such as \"cancer-causing mineral water\".[134] As the 2008 Chinese milk scandal broke in September 2008, there was widespread speculation that China's desire for a perfect Games may have been a factor contributing towards the delayed recall of contaminated infant formula.[135][136]\n\n\nThe 2008 Olympics were hit by a number of doping scandals before and after the Games had commenced. Since seven Russian track and field stars were suspended just before the start of the Games for allegedly tampering with their urine samples, only five of the seven who were due to take part could participate. Eleven Greek weightlifters also failed tests in the run up to the Games and the entire Bulgarian weightlifting team had to withdraw after eleven of their weightlifters also failed tests. A small number of athletes from other nations also failed pre-Games tests.[137][138][139]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing 2008 cauldron in 2013\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics have been generally accepted by the world's media as a logistical success.[140][141] Many of the worst fears about the Games failed to materialize: no terrorists struck Beijing; no athlete protested at the podium (though Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian tossed his bronze medal in disgust over judging); and the air quality, despite being the worst in Olympics history, was not as bad as many had feared beforehand – due largely to favorable weather patterns.[142][143]\n\n\nMany in China viewed the Olympics as \"an affirmation of a single nationalistic dream\" and saw protests during the international torch relay as an insult to China.[144] The Games also bolstered domestic support for the Chinese government, and for the policies of the Communist Party, giving rise to concerns that the Olympics would give the state more leverage to suppress political dissent, at least temporarily.[145] Efforts to quell any unrest before and during the Games also contributed to a rapid expansion in the size and political clout of China's internal security forces, and this growth continued through the following years.[146] Reports also indicated that the Olympics boosted the political careers of pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong, as many Chinese gold medal winners campaigned on behalf of the pro-Beijing DAB during the 2008 election,[147] although any trend towards greater identification by Hong Kongers with Mainland China appears to have been short-lived.[148]\n\n\nSome sectors of the Beijing economy may have benefited from the influx of tourists. Other sectors such as manufacturing lost revenue because of plant closings related to the government's efforts to improve air quality. Four years after the Games, many of the specially constructed facilities were underused or even deserted.[149] It is generally expected by economists that there will be no lasting effects on Beijing's economy from the Games.[150] One 2009 study found that countries that host the Olympics experience a significant boost in trade, but this is also the case for countries which merely bid to host: \"The benefit, in other words, came from the signal that a country was open for business, not from the spending itself.\"[151]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2008 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in China\n\t+ 2008 Summer Olympics – Beijing\n\t+ 2014 Summer Youth Olympics – Nanjing\n\t+ 2022 Winter Olympics – Beijing\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* Doping at the Olympic Games – 2008 Beijing\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The official logo for the 2008 Summer Olympics, featuring a depiction of the Chinese pictogram \"京\", from the word **Beijing** (**北京**) representing a dancing human figure, in reference to the host city.

The fourth event is determined by a vote. In 2004, the three men's team events (foil, saber, épée) and the women's épée were held, so in 2008, both the women's foil and saber events, as well as the men's épée, were automatically selected. The fourth event, men's saber, was chosen over men's foil by a 45:20 vote.[93]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Factsheet - Opening Ceremony of the Games of the Olympiad\" (PDF) (Press release).

The first event, the group stage in women's football, began on 25 July at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, followed by the opening ceremony on 27 July.[3][4] There were 10,518 athletes from 206 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) who participated in the 2012 Olympics.[5]\n\n\nFollowing a bid headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe and the then-London mayor Ken Livingstone, London was selected as the host city at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore on 6 July 2005, defeating bids from Moscow, New York City, Madrid, and Paris.[6] London became the first city to host the modern Olympics three times,[7][b] having previously hosted the Summer Games in 1908 and 1948.[8][9] Construction for the Games involved considerable redevelopment, with an emphasis on sustainability.[10] The main focus was a new 200-hectare (490-acre) Olympic Park, constructed on a former industrial site in Stratford, East London.[11] The Games also made use of venues that already existed before the bid.[12]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (104). China finished second with a total of 91 medals (38 gold) and Great Britain came third with 65 medals overall (29 gold). Michael Phelps of the United States became the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, winning his 22nd medal.[13] Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Brunei entered female athletes for the first time, meaning that every currently eligible country has now sent a female competitor to at least one Olympic Games.[14] Women's boxing was included for the first time, and the 2012 Games became the first at which every sport had female competitors.[15][16][17]\n\n\nThe Games received considerable praise for their organisation, with the volunteers, the British military and public enthusiasm commended particularly highly.[18][19][20] The Games were described as \"happy and glorious\".[21] The opening ceremony, directed by Academy Award winner Danny Boyle, received widespread acclaim.[22][23] These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Belgian Jacques Rogge, who was succeeded by German Thomas Bach the next year.\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nLondon was chosen over Birmingham to represent Great Britain's bid by the British Olympic Association.\n\n\nBy 15 July 2003—the deadline for interested cities to submit bids to the International Olympic Committee (IOC)—nine cities had submitted bids to host the 2012 Summer Olympics: Havana, Istanbul, Leipzig, London, Madrid, Moscow, New York City, Paris, and Rio de Janeiro.[24] On 18 May 2004, as a result of a scored technical evaluation, the IOC reduced the number of cities to five: London, Madrid, Moscow, New York and Paris.[25] All five submitted their candidate files by 19 November 2004 and were visited by the IOC inspection team during February and March 2005. The Paris bid suffered two setbacks during the IOC inspection visit: a number of strikes and demonstrations coinciding with the visits, and a report that a key member of the bid team, Guy Drut, would face charges over alleged corrupt party political finances.[26]\n\n\nThroughout the process, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, particularly as this was its third bid in recent years. London was initially seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin.[27] Its position began to improve after the appointment of Lord Coe as the new chair of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) on 19 May 2004.[28] In late August 2004, reports predicted a tie between London and Paris.[29]\n\n\nOn 6 June 2005, the IOC released its evaluation reports for the five candidate cities. They did not contain any scores or rankings, but the report for Paris was considered the most positive. London was close behind, having closed most of the gap observed by the initial evaluation in 2004. New York and Madrid also received very positive evaluations.[30] On 1 July 2005, when asked who would win, Jacques Rogge said, \"I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less.\"[31]\n\n\nOn 6 July 2005, the final selection was announced at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore. Moscow was the first city to be eliminated, followed by New York and Madrid. The final two contenders were London and Paris. At the end of the fourth round of voting, London won the right to host the 2012 Games with 54 votes to 50.[32]\n\n\nThe celebrations in London were short-lived, being overshadowed by bombings on London's transport system less than 24 hours after the announcement.[33]\n\n\n\n\n\n**2012 host city election – ballot results**\n| City\n | NOC\n | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** | **Round 4** |\n| London | ![](image) Great Britain | **22** | 27 | **39** | **54** |\n| Paris | ![](image) France | 21 | 25 | 33 | 50\n |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | 20 | **32** | 31 | —\n |\n| New York City | ![](image) United States | 19 | 17 | — | —\n |\n| Moscow | ![](image) Russia | 15 | — | — | —\n |\n|  | **Total ballots** | 97\n | 101\n | 103\n | 104\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympic development\n\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) was created to oversee the staging of the Games, and held its first board meeting on 3 October 2005.[34] The committee, chaired by Lord Coe, was in charge of implementing and staging the Games, while the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), established in April 2006, was in charge of construction of the venues and infrastructure.[34][35]\n\n\nThe Government Olympic Executive (GOE), a unit within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), was the lead government body for coordinating the London 2012 Olympics. It focused on oversight of the Games, cross-programme management, and the London 2012 Olympic Legacy before and after the Games that would benefit London and the wider United Kingdom. The organisation was also responsible for the supervision of the £9.3 billion of public sector funding.[36]\n\n\nIn August 2011, security concerns arose surrounding the hosting of the Olympic Games in London, following the 2011 England riots.[37] Some countries expressed safety concerns,[38] despite the IOC's assurance that the riots would not affect the Games.[39] The IOC's Coordination Commission for the 2012 Games completed its tenth and final visit to London in March 2012. Its members concluded that \"London is ready to host the world this summer\".[40]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\nThe 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games used a mixture of new venues, existing and historic facilities, and temporary facilities, some of them in well-known locations such as Hyde Park and Horse Guards Parade. After the Games, some of the new facilities would be reused in their Olympic form, while others will be resized or relocated.[41]\n\n\nThe majority of venues were divided into three zones within Greater London: the Olympic Zone, the River Zone and the Central Zone. In addition there were a few venues that, by necessity, were outside the boundaries of Greater London, such as the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy some 125 mi (201 km) southwest of London, which hosted the sailing events. The football tournament was staged at several grounds around the UK.[42] Work began on the Park in December 2006, when a sports hall in Eton Manor was pulled down.[43] The athletes' village in Portland was completed in September 2011.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)London Olympic Stadium\nIn November 2004, the 200-hectare (500-acre) Olympic Park plans were revealed.[45] The plans for the site were approved in September 2004 by Tower Hamlets, Newham, Hackney and Waltham Forest.[46] The redevelopment of the area to build the Olympic Park required compulsory purchase orders of property. The London Development Agency was in dispute with London and Continental Railways about the orders in November 2005. By May 2006, 86% of the land had been bought as businesses fought eviction.[47] Residents who opposed the eviction tried to find ways to stop it by setting up campaigns, but they had to leave as 94% of land was bought and the other 6% bought as a £9 billion regeneration project started.[48]\n\n\nThere were some issues with the original venues not being challenging enough or being financially unviable. Both the Olympic road races and the mountain bike event were initially considered to be too easy, so they were eventually scheduled on new locations.[49][50] The Olympic marathon course, which was set to finish in the Olympic stadium, was moved to The Mall, since closing Tower Bridge was deemed to cause traffic problems in central London.[51] North Greenwich Arena 2 was scrapped in a cost-cutting exercise, Wembley Arena being used for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics events instead.[52][53][54][55]\n\n\nTest events were held throughout 2011 and 2012, either through an existing championship such as 2012 Wimbledon Championships or as a specially created event held under the banner of *London Prepares*.[56] Team GB House was the British Olympic Association's operational HQ up to and during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Designed by architects Gebler Tooth on the top floor of an office building in Westfield Stratford City, it combined the team HQ, athletes' \"Friends and Family\" lounge, Press Centre, and VIP lounge.\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Olympic Javelin high-speed service ran between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet, via Stratford.\nIOC's initial evaluation felt that, if transport improvements were delivered in time for the Games, London would cope.[57] Transport for London (TfL) carried out numerous improvements in preparation for 2012, including the expansion of the London Overground's East London Line, upgrades to the Docklands Light Railway and the North London Line, and the introduction of a new \"Javelin\" high-speed rail service.[58] According to Network Rail, an additional 4,000 train services operated during the Games, and train operators ran longer trains during the day.[59] During the Games, Stratford International station was not served by any international services (just as it had not been before the Games),[60] westbound trains did not stop at Hackney Wick railway station,[61] and Pudding Mill Lane DLR station closed entirely during the Games.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Emirates Air Line crosses the River Thames between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks.\nTfL also built a £25 million cable car across the River Thames, called the Emirates Air Line, to link 2012 Olympics venues.[63] It was inaugurated in June 2012 and crosses the Thames between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks, carrying up to 2,500 passengers an hour, cutting journey times between the O2 arena and the ExCeL exhibition centre and providing a crossing every 30 seconds.[64]\n\n\nThe plan was to have 80% of athletes travel less than 20 minutes to their event[65] and 93% of them within 30 minutes of their event.[66] The Olympic Park would be served by ten separate railway lines with a combined capacity of 240,000 passengers per hour.[67] In addition, LOCOG planned for 90% of the venues to be served by three or more types of public transport.[66] Two park-and-ride sites off the M25 with a combined capacity of 12,000 cars were 25 minutes away from the Olympic Park. Another park-and-ride site was planned in Ebbsfleet with a capacity for 9,000 cars where spectators could board a 10-minute shuttle train service.[66] To get spectators to Eton Dorney, four park-and-ride schemes were set up.[68] These Park and Ride services were operated by First Games Transport.[69]\n\n\nTfL defined a network of roads leading between venues as the Olympic Route Network; roads connecting all of the Olympic venues located within London. Many of these roads also contained special \"Olympic lanes\" marked with the Olympic rings—reserved for the use of Olympic athletes, officials, and other VIPs during the Games. Members of the public driving in an Olympic lane were subject to a fine of £130. Additionally, London buses would not include roads with Olympic lanes on their routes.[70][71][72] Concerns were expressed at the logistics of spectators travelling to the events outside London. In particular, the sailing events at Portland had no direct motorway connections, and local roads are heavily congested by tourist traffic in the summer.[73] However, a £77 million relief road connecting Weymouth to Dorchester was built and opened in 2011.[74][75] Some £16 million was put aside for the rest of the improvements.[76]\n\n\nTfL created a promotional campaign and website, *Get Ahead of the Games*, to help provide information related to transport during the Olympics and Paralympics. Through the campaign, TfL also encouraged the use of cycling as a mode of transport.[77] A temporary terminal was created at Heathrow Airport to be used by 10,100 departing athletes after the Games. Up to 35% more bags than normal were expected on 13 August, which was predicted to be the busiest day in the airport's history, according to Nick Cole, head of Olympic and Paralympic planning at Heathrow.\n\n\n\n### Cost and financing[edit]\n\n\nA study from Oxford University found that the sports-related costs of London 2012 amounted to US$15 billion, compared with $4.6 billion for Rio 2016, $40–44 billion for Beijing 2008, and $51 billion for Sochi 2014 (the most expensive Olympics in history). London 2012 went over budget by 76% in real terms, measured from bid to completion. Cost per athlete was $1.4 million.[78] This does not include wider costs for urban and transport infrastructure, which often equal or exceed the sports-related costs.\n\n\nThe costs of staging the Games were separate from those for building the venues and infrastructure and redeveloping the land for the Olympic Park. While the Games were privately funded, the venues and infrastructure were largely financed using public money.\n\n\nAccording to *The Wall Street Journal*, the original budget for the Games was increased to about £9.3 billion (US$15.28 billion) in 2007.[79] The revised figures were announced to the House of Commons on 15 March 2007 by Tessa Jowell. Along with East End regeneration costs, the breakdown was:\n\n\n\n* Building the venues and infrastructure – £5.3 billion\n* Elite sport and Paralympic funding – £400 million\n* Security and policing – £600 million\n* Regeneration of the Lower Lea Valley – £1.7 billion\n* Contingency fund – £2.7 billion\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nUnpaid volunteers known as Games Makers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games.[80] A target of 70,000 volunteers was set as early as 2004.[81] When recruitment took place in 2010, more than 240,000 applications were received.[82] Sebastian Coe said in February 2012, \"Our Games Makers will contribute a total of around eight million volunteer hours during the Games and the Games simply wouldn't happen without them\".[83] The volunteers wore clothing that included purple and red polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, grey socks and grey-and-white trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre. Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges that were also worn by officials, athletes, family members and media, which gained them access to specific venues and buildings around the site.\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nOrganisers estimated that some 8 million tickets would be available for the Olympic Games,[84] and 1.5 million tickets for the Paralympic Games.[84] LOCOG aimed to raise £375–£400 million in ticket sales. There were also free events such as marathon, triathlon and road cycling,[85] although, for the first time in Olympic history, the sailing events were ticketed.[86] Eventually, more than 7,000,000 tickets were sold.[87] Following IOC rules, people applied for tickets from the NOC of their country of residence. European Union residents were able to apply for tickets in any EU country.[88]\n\n\nIn Great Britain, ticket prices ranged from £20 for many events to £2,012 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. Some free tickets were given to military personnel as part of the Tickets For Troops scheme,[89] as well as to survivors and families of those who died during 7 July 2005 London bombings.[90] Initially, people were able to apply for tickets via a website from 15 March until 26 April 2011. There was a huge demand for tickets, with a demand of more than three times the number of tickets available.[91][92] On 11 May 2012 a round of nearly one million \"second chance\" tickets went on sale over a 10-day period between 23 June and 3 July 2011.[93] About 1.7 million tickets were available for football and 600,000 for other sports, including archery, field hockey, football, judo, boxing and volleyball. Ten sports had sold out by 8 am of the first day.[94]\n\n\n\n### Countdown[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Countdown Clock in Trafalgar Square\nDuring the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympics, the Olympic Flag was formally handed over from the Mayor of Beijing to the Mayor of London. This was followed by a section highlighting London,[95] One month later, the Olympic and Paralympic flags were raised outside the London City Hall.[96]\n\n\nA countdown clock in Trafalgar Square was unveiled, 500 days before the Games.[97][98] It was a two-sided clock with the Paralympic countdown on the other side. The countdown to the start of the Olympics began with a ceremony for the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, Greece.[99]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Security for the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nSee also: Controversies surrounding G4S\n\nThe police led the security operation (named **Operation Olympics** by the Ministry of Defence), with 10,000 officers available, supported by 13,500 members of the British Armed Forces. Naval and air assets were deployed as part of the security operation, including ships situated in the Thames, Typhoon fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles;[100] it was the biggest security operation Britain had faced in decades. The cost of security increased from £282 million to £553 million, and the figure of 13,500 armed forces personnel was greater than the number deployed at the time in Afghanistan.[101] The Metropolitan Police and the Royal Marines carried out security exercises in preparation for the Olympics on 19 January 2012, with 50 marine police officers in rigid inflatables and fast response boats, joined by up to 100 military personnel and a Royal Navy Lynx helicopter.[102]\n\n\nThe Ministry of Defence distributed leaflets to residents of the Lexington building in Bow, announcing that a missile system was to be stationed on top of the water tower.[103][104] This caused concern to some residents.[103][104] The Ministry said it probably would use Starstreak missiles and that site evaluations had taken place, but that no final decision had taken place.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Front of the Silver Medal won by the USA.\nApproximately 4,700[105] Olympic and Paralympic medals were produced by the Royal Mint at Llantrisant.[106] They were designed by David Watkins (Olympics) and Lin Cheung (Paralympics).[107] 99% of the gold, silver and copper was donated by Rio Tinto from a mine in Salt Lake County, Utah in the U.S.[108] The remaining 1% came from a Mongolian mine.[109] Each medal weighs 375–400 g (13.2–14.1 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 7 mm (0.28 in) thick, with the sport and discipline engraved on the rim.[110] The obverse, as is traditional, features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, stepping from the Panathinaiko Stadium that hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, with Parthenon in the background; the reverse features the Games logo, the River Thames and a series of lines representing \"the energy of athletes and a sense of pulling together\".[111] The medals were transferred to the Tower of London vaults on 2 July 2012 for storage.[110]\n\n\nEach gold medal is 92.5 percent silver and 1.34 percent gold, with the remainder copper. The silver medal is 92.5 percent silver, with the remainder copper. The bronze medal is made up of 97 percent copper, 2.5 percent zinc, and 0.5 per cent tin.[112] The value of the materials in the gold medal was about £410 (US$644), the silver about £210 (US$330), and the bronze about £3 (US$4.71) as of 30 July 2012.[113]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\nThe Olympics torch relay ran from 19 May to 27 July 2012, before the Games. Plans for the relay were developed in 2010–11, with the torch-bearer selection process announced on 18 May 2011.[114] The torch was designed by Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby.\n\n\nOn 18 May 2012 the Olympic flame arrived at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall from Greece[115] on flight BA2012, operated by a British Airways Airbus A319 named \"Firefly\". The relay lasted 70 days, with 66 evening celebrations and six island visits, and involved some 8,000 people carrying the torch about 8,000 mi (12,875 km), starting from Land's End in Cornwall.[116] The torch had three days outside the United Kingdom when it visited the Isle of Man on 2 June, Dublin in Ireland, on 6 June,[117] and both Guernsey and Jersey on 15 July.\n\n\nThe relay focused on National Heritage Sites, locations with sporting significance, key sporting events, schools registered with the Get Set School Network, green spaces and biodiversity, Live Sites (city locations with large screens), and festivals and other events.[118] Dumfries and Galloway was the only Region in the whole of the United Kingdom that had the Olympic Torch pass through it twice. A group of young athletes, nominated by retired Olympic athletes, ran the torch around the stadium. These torchbearers were Callum Airlie, Jordan Duckitt, Desiree Henry, Katie Kirk, Cameron MacRitchie, Aidan Reynolds, and Adelle Tracey. Together the torchbearers each lit a petal that spread the fire to the 204 petals of the cauldron, representing the countries that participated in the Games.[119] The cauldron was designed by Thomas Heatherwick.\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nThe Olympic Park was planned to incorporate 45 hectares of wildlife habitat, with a total of 525 bird boxes and 150 bat boxes. Local waterways and riverbanks were enhanced as part of the process.[120] Renewable energy also featured at the Olympics. It was originally planned to provide 20% of the energy for the Olympic Park and Village from renewable technologies; however, only 9% of it was achieved.[121] Proposals to meet the original target included large-scale on-site wind turbines and hydroelectric generators in the River Thames. These plans were scrapped for safety reasons.[122] The focus subsequently moved to installing solar panels on some buildings, and providing the opportunity to recover energy from waste. Where it could not be reused or recycled, food packaging for use at the Olympics—including fast-food wrappers, sandwich boxes and drink cartons—was made from compostable materials like starch and cellulose-based bioplastics. After use, many of these materials were suitable for anaerobic digestion (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy.[123]\n\n\nPost-Games, buildings like the Water Polo Arena were relocated elsewhere. Building parts like roofing covers and membranes of different temporary venues were recycled via VinyLoop. This allowed organisers to meet the standards of the Olympic Delivery Authority concerning environmental protection.\n\n\nLondon 2012 inaugurated Olympic Games guidelines that included the recycling of PVC, which was used for temporary buildings such as the Basketball Arena and for the temporary parts of permanent venues such as the Olympic Stadium.[124] In the Water Polo Arena, PVC roofing was made from recycled cushions to provide insulation.[125] Through this recycling process, the Olympic Games PVC Policy was fulfilled; the policy states:[126]\n\n\n\nWhere London 2012 procures PVC for temporary usage or where permanent usage is not assured, London 2012 is required to ensure that there is a take-back scheme that offers a closed-loop reuse system or mechanical recycling system for post-consumer waste.\nAccording to Kirsten Henson, Materials Manager for the London 2012 Olympic Park: \"The majority of temporary facilities created for the Olympic Games including the Aquatic centre temporary stands, basketball arena, Water Polo Arena, and the shooting facilities at the Royal Artillery Barracks, are essentially big tents. Basically, PVC stretched over lightweight steel frame. This design solution makes them efficient to install, reduces the need for any significant foundations and are, of course, reusable. We were challenged by the public around the use of PVC; but we considered it to be the right material for certain functions. We therefore challenged the PVC supply chain to have certain environmental performance criteria in place, including a take back and recycle scheme.\"[127]\n\n\n\n### Cultural Olympiad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Cultural Olympiad\n\n![](image)Tower Bridge was illuminated with the Olympic Rings in the week leading up to the opening ceremony.\nThe Olympic Charter, the set of rules and guidelines for the organization of the Olympic Games and for governing the Olympic Movement, states that\n\n\n\n\n> LOCOG shall organise a programme of cultural events which must cover at least the entire period during which the Olympic Village is open.[128]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Cultural Olympiad comprised many programmes, with more than 500 events spread over four years across the whole of the United Kingdom, and culminating in the London 2012 Festival.[129][130]\n\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and 2012 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)Fireworks at the opening ceremony\nTitled \"The Isles of Wonder\", the opening ceremony began at 21:00 British Summer Time (UTC+1) on 27 July in the Olympic Stadium.[131] Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle was artistic director and Rick Smith of Underworld was musical director.[132] The opening ceremony was immediately seen as a tremendous success, widely praised as a \"masterpiece\" and \"a love letter to Britain\".[133][134] The principal sections of the artistic display represented Britain's Industrial Revolution, National Health Service, literary heritage, popular music and culture, and were noted for their vibrant storytelling and use of music.\n\n\nThe Games were officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.[135] This was the second Olympic Games opened personally by the Queen, the first being in 1976 in Montreal, Canada. The ceremony featured a short comic film starring Daniel Craig as secret agent James Bond and the Queen as herself.[136] There was also a musical comedy item starring Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean playing along with the London Symphony Orchestra.[137] These were widely ascribed to Britain's sense of humour.[138]\n\n\nLive musical performers included Frank Turner, Dame Evelyn Glennie, Mike Oldfield, Dizzee Rascal, Arctic Monkeys, and Sir Paul McCartney who performed \"Hey Jude\" as the closing act.[139][140] Broadcast live on BBC One, the ceremony attracted a peak viewing audience of over 27 million in the UK.[141]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers\n\nThe closing ceremony was held on 12 August. It featured a flashback fiesta to British music with The Who closing the performance. The ceremony also included a handover of the Olympic flag by Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, to Eduardo Paes, Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, the host city of the 2016 Summer Olympics.[142] In his closing address, Jacques Rogge described the Games as \"happy and glorious\".[21]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Number of participating

acquired at least one medal: gold, silver or bronze)[143] surpassing the 1948 Summer Olympics in London and the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester as the largest multi-sport event ever to be held in the United Kingdom.[144]\n\n\nThree athletes from the Netherlands Antilles, which whose territory was dissolved in 2010 and lost its recognition during 123rd IOC session held during July 2011, and one athlete from South Sudan, which their NOC was recognized in 2015, participated as two independent athletes teams under the Olympic flag.[145]\n\n\n\n| Participating National Olympic Committees

countries and continents had a \"national house\".

In the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2012 Summer Olympics Sports Programme\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aquatics\n\t+ ![](image) Diving (8)\n\t+ ![](image) Swimming (34)\n\t+ ![](image) Synchronized swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (4)\n* ![](image) Athletics (47)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* ![](image) Basketball (2)\n* ![](image) Boxing (13)\n | * ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n* ![](image) Cycling (competitors)\n\t+ BMX (2)\n\t+ Mountain biking (2)\n\t+ Road (4)\n\t+ Track (10)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n | * ![](image) Fencing (10)\n* ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n* ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (14)\n* ![](image) Modern pentathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Rowing (14)\n* ![](image) Sailing (10)\n | * ![](image) Shooting (15)\n* ![](image) Table tennis (4)\n* ![](image) Taekwondo (8)\n* ![](image) Tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (15)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (11)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (7)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\nWomen's boxing was included in the programme for the first time, and 36 women competed in three weight classes. There was a special dispensation for the shooting events, which would otherwise have been illegal under UK gun law.[149][150] In tennis, mixed doubles returned to the Olympic programme for the first time since 1924.[151]\n\n\nLondon's bid featured the same 28 sports that had been included in other recent Summer Olympics, but the IOC voted to drop baseball and softball from the 2012 Games just two days after London had been selected as the host city. There was an appeal, but the IOC voted to uphold the decision, and the two sports were scheduled to be discontinued after their last appearance at the 2008 Olympics.[152] The IOC then voted on whether or not to replace them; karate, squash, golf, roller sports and rugby sevens were considered. Karate and squash were the two final nominees, but neither received enough votes to reach the required two-thirds majority.[152]\n\n\nAlthough formal demonstration sports were eliminated after the 1992 Summer Olympics,[153] special tournaments for non-Olympic sports can be run during the Games, such as the Wushu tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics.[154] There were attempts to run Twenty20 cricket[154] and netball[155] tournaments alongside the 2012 Games, but neither campaign was successful.\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2012 Summer

Records[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mo Farah (left) with Usain Bolt (right), demonstrating one another's famous gestures (the \"Lightning Bolt\" and \"Mobot\")\nMain article: World and Olympic records set at the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nThese Olympic Games resulted in 32 world records in eight sports. The largest number of records were set in swimming, at eight. China, Great Britain and the United States set the most records, at five each.\n\n\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nFurther information: List of 2012 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nA total of 85 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) won medals, 54 of those countries winning at least one gold medal. Seven NOCs won their first ever Olympic medal: Bahrain (gold),[157] Botswana (silver),[158] Cyprus (silver),[159] Gabon (silver),[160] Grenada (gold),[161] Guatemala (silver),[162] and Montenegro (silver).[163] The United States finished at the top of the table, winning 47 gold medals and a total of 104 medals. China finished second with 38 gold medals and 91 medals overall, and hosts Great Britain came in third place, winning 29 gold medals and 65 medals overall in their best performance since London hosted its first Summer Olympics in 1908, pushing Russia—who won 18 gold medals and 66 medals in total, after doping redistributions (initially 24 gold and 82 total)—into fourth place.\n\n\n\nKey\n  ‡   Changes in medal standings (see subpage)\n\n\n\n  \\*   Host nation (Great Britain)\n\n\n\n2012 Summer Olympics medal table[164]| Rank | NOC | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) United States‡ | 48 | 26 | 30 | 104 |\n| 2 | ![](image) China‡ | 39 | 31 | 22 | 92 |\n| 3 | ![](image) Great Britain\\*‡ | 29 | 18 | 18 | 65 |\n| 4 | ![](image) Russia‡ | 18 | 21 | 26 | 65 |\n| 5 | ![](image) South Korea‡ | 13 | 9 | 9 | 31 |\n| 6 | ![](image) Germany‡ | 11 | 20 | 13 | 44 |\n| 7 | ![](image) France‡ | 11 | 11 | 13 | 35 |\n| 8 | ![](image) Australia‡ | 8 | 15 | 12 | 35 |\n| 9 | ![](image) Italy | 8 | 9 | 11 | 28 |\n| 10 | ![](image) Hungary‡ | 8 | 4 | 6 | 18 |\n| 11–86 | Remaining NOCs | 110 | 141 | 193 | 444 |\n| Totals (86 entries) | 303 | 305 | 353 | 961 |\n\n\n### Podium sweeps[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Sport\n | Event\n | NOC\n | Gold\n | Silver\n | Bronze\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 28 July\n | Fencing | Women's foil | ![](image) Italy | Elisa Di Francisca | Arianna Errigo | Valentina Vezzali |\n| 9 August\n | Athletics | Men's 200 metres | ![](image) Jamaica | Usain Bolt | Yohan Blake | Warren Weir |\n| 11 August\n | Athletics | Women's 20 kilometres walk[165] | ![](image) China | Qieyang Shenjie | Liu Hong | Lü Xiuzhi |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2012 Summer Olympics broadcasters\n\n![](image)Here East, the former London Olympics Media Centre. It now accommodates campuses for Staffordshire University, Loughborough University and University College London an is a location for start-up businesses.[166]\nThe host broadcaster was Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS), an agency of the IOC. The OBS used its own cameras and crews subcontracted from other Olympic broadcasters to cover the events. The base video and audio were sold to other broadcasters, who added their own commentary and presentation.\n\n\nThe official recording format of the 2012 Summer Olympics used Panasonic's digital technologies. The official video was produced and distributed from the International Broadcast Centre in 1080/50i High-Definition (HD) format. Panasonic announced that DVCPRO HD would be the official recording format. OBS London used P2 HD shoulder-mount camcorders.[167]\n\n\nThe IOC wanted television coverage to reach as broad a worldwide audience as possible, and several national and regional broadcasters covered London 2012. In the UK, the BBC carried the Olympics and Channel 4 the Paralympics. The BBC aimed to broadcast all 5,000 hours of the Games.[168] BBC Parliament's Freeview channel was suspended, BBC Three's on-air time was extended so that it could show Olympic events in the daytime, and 24 additional BBC Olympics channels were available via cable, satellite and the internet in the UK.\n\n\nThe US television rights, owned by NBC, accounted for more than half the rights revenue for the IOC. Despite high viewership, many viewers were disappointed with NBC's coverage.[169] The operations of broadcasters granted rights to the Games were hosted in the dedicated International Broadcast Centre inside the security cordon of the Olympic Park. YouTube planned to stream the Games in 64 territories in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa where there were no official broadcasters.[170]\n\n\nIn Sri Lanka a dispute occurred between Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) and MBC Networks (MTV/MBC) as to who was the official broadcaster of the Games. This problem was caused as Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) had offered the official broadcasting rights to both networks, as both of the networks were ABU members. So SLRC filed a case against MBC Networks for broadcasting rights at the Colombo Magistrate's Court. Considering the case, the court issued a special court order preventing MBC Networks' Olympic broadcast and stated that SLRC should be the sole broadcaster.[171] However, when the Games started, both networks broadcast most of the events simultaneously. Another dispute had previously occurred between Carlton Sports Network (CSN) and SLRC, but the Sports Minister, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, had stated that SLRC had the exclusive rights.[172]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Golden Rings Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2012, the IOC announced the winners of the Golden Ring Awards for the best broadcast coverage of the Games. Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to the sailing, produced by Christopher Lincoln, Gary Milkis, and Ursula Romero. The production for the canoe/kayak slalom and the rowing/canoe sprint came second and third respectively. The award for Best On Air Promotion went to NBC with Foxtel and ZDF finishing second and third. NBC Olympics also won the Best Olympic Feature category, as Sky Italia came second and ZDF third. The Best Athlete Profile award went to TV Record's profile of Sarah Menezes, NBC came second with their profile of David Rudisha, and ESPN Latin America took third place with a profile of Miguel Correa and Ruben Rezola. The award for Best Olympic Programme went to NBC, host broadcasters the BBC took second place for Super Saturday (the middle Saturday of the Games), and third place was claimed by the Nine Network for their live coverage of Day 16 of the Games.[173]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n\"Survival\" by Muse was announced as the official song of the Olympics,[174] to be played by international broadcasters reporting on the Games.[175] The track was noted to express a sense of conviction and determination to win.[176] In August 2009, the Royal Mail commissioned artists and illustrators to design 30 stamps, which were released in batches of 10 between 2009 and 2011.[177] The last ones were released on 22 July 2011.[178] Two £5 coins designed by Saiman Miah have been made to commemorate the Olympics.[179] As with other Olympics since 1952, the Royal Mint will strike a set of commemorative one-kilogram gold and silver coins.[180]\n\n\n\n### Motto[edit]\n\n\nThe official motto for the 2012 Summer Olympics is \"Inspire a generation\". It was chosen to highlight the organisers' commitment to inspire the world, including younger generations, to get involved in sporting events through the Games' legacy.[181]\n\n\n\n### Logo and graphics[edit]\n\n\nThere have been two London 2012 logos: one used for the bidding process, and the other used in the branding for the Games themselves. The bid logo, created by Kino Design, was a ribbon with blue, yellow, black, green, and red stripes winding through the text \"LONDON 2012\", making the shape of the River Thames in East London. The main logo, designed by Wolff Olins and published on 4 June 2007, is a representation of the number 2012, with the Olympic Rings embedded within the zero.[182]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Paralympics logo (far left) and the different official colour combinations for the Wolff Olins main logo design\n\nPublic reaction to the main logo in a June 2007 BBC poll was largely mixed; more than 80% of votes gave it the lowest possible rating.[183] Several newspapers ran their own logo competitions, displaying alternative submissions from their readers,[184] and several writers from news agencies criticised the logo.[184][185][186] It was suggested that the logo resembled the American cartoon characters Lisa Simpson and Bart Simpson performing fellatio.[187][188] In February 2011, Iran threatened to boycott the Olympics, complaining that the logo appeared to spell out the word \"Zion\". However, this boycott did not occur.[189]\n\n\n\n### Colours[edit]\n\n\n     The four main colours used in the branding of the Games were pink, blue, green, and orange. These colours were chosen to showcase the spirit of the Games: energetic, spirited, youthful, and bright.\n\n\n    The auxiliary colours used in the branding were dark purple, grey, and gold. These were mostly used in symbols and graphics to offset the brightness of the main colours.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wenlock and Mandeville\n\n![](image)The Olympic Mascots, Mandeville (left) and Wenlock (right)\nThe official mascots for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games were unveiled on 19 May 2010, targeted for children.[190] Wenlock and Mandeville are animations depicting two drops of steel from a steelworks in Bolton.[190]\n\n\nThey are named after Much Wenlock, a town in Shropshire that holds a forerunner of the current Olympic Games, and Stoke Mandeville, a village in Buckinghamshire where a forerunner of the Paralympic Games was first held.[190] The writer Michael Morpurgo wrote the story concept for the mascots, and an animation was produced.[191] Two stories have been created about the mascots: *Out Of A Rainbow* and *Adventures On A Rainbow*.[192]\n\n\n*Creative Review* magazine liked the mascots,[193] but elsewhere their design was greeted with some disdain. However, the mascots' creators claim that young people find the duo appealing.[194]\n\n\n\n### *Chariots of Fire*[edit]\n\n\nThe 1981 Best Picture Oscar–winning film *Chariots of Fire*, which tells the story of two British athletes in the 1924 Olympics, was a recurring theme in promotions for the 2012 Olympics.[195] A digitally re-mastered version of *Chariots of Fire* was released on 13 July 2012 and screened in over 100 UK cinemas as part of the celebrations,[196] and a 2012 stage adaptation ran in London theatres from 9 May 2012 to 5 January 2013.[197] The film's theme tune was performed during the opening ceremony by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Simon Rattle. The performance was accompanied by a comedic skit by Rowan Atkinson, which included the opening beach-running footage from the film.[198] A new orchestration of the film's theme tune was played during each medal presentation of the Games.[199]\n\n\n\n### Sponsors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics marketing § Sponsors\n\nLOCOG and the IOC agreed sponsorship deals with several companies, each assigned to one of four categories; worldwide, tier one, tier two and tier three.[200] The worldwide partners were: Acer, Atos, Coca-Cola, Dow, General Electric, McDonald's, Omega SA, Panasonic, Procter & Gamble, Samsung and Visa.[200] Tier one partners were: Adidas, BMW, BP, British Airways, BT Group, EDF Energy and Lloyds TSB.[201] The tier two partners were: Adecco, ArcelorMittal, Cadbury, Deloitte, Thomas Cook Group, Cisco Systems and United Parcel Service.[201] Tier three partners were: Aggreko, Airwave, Atkins, The Boston Consulting Group, CBS Outdoor, Crystal CG, Eurostar, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, G4S, GlaxoSmithKline, Gymnova, Heathrow Airport, Heineken, Holiday Inn, John Lewis & Partners, McCann Worldgroup, Mondo, Nature Valley, Next, Nielsen Company, Populous (company), Rapiscan Systems, Rio Tinto (corporation), Technogym, Thames Water, Ticketmaster, Trebor and Westfield Group.[201] The companies provided £1.4 billion of funding altogether, allocated evenly between the IOC and LOCOG.[201]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Controversies at the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nDuring the lead-up to the Games, there were controversies over sponsorship,[202] the athletes' use of social media, and several political issues. After a complicated lottery process, thousands of people failed to secure seats for the events they wanted, but a large number of empty seats were observed throughout the Games, even at some of the most popular events. There was speculation that this was due to a failure of corporate sponsors to make use of tickets they had received.[87]\n\n\nDuring the Games, eight competitors in the badminton women's doubles were disqualified for \"not using best efforts\", when they tried to lose matches in the group stage to obtain more favourable fixtures in the knockout rounds.[203][204] A number of results in boxing, gymnastics and judo were overturned by officials after initial decisions were appealed against.[205][206][207]\n\n\nYe Shiwen faced doping allegations after her gold medal in the women's 400m Individual Medley as she came from being behind the world record in the final 50m to beating it by 1.02 seconds. Furthermore, she swam her last 50m 0.17 seconds quicker than the men's winner of the corresponding race. All charges were later dropped.[208]\n\n\nJust before the start of the Men's 100m Final, a spectator threw a plastic bottle into Tyson Gay's lane, intended to hit Usain Bolt who was three lanes outside in Lane 7. The race was unaffected, and Bolt would go on to become the second man in history to defend a 100m Olympic title. The spectator, later identified as Ashley Gill-Webb, was soon arrested after he was struck on the head by Dutch judoka and bronze medalist Edith Bosch, whom he happened to be sitting next to.[209][210] LOCOG Chairman Sebastian Coe later stated: \"I'm not suggesting vigilantism, but it was actually poetic justice that they happened to be sitting next to a judo player\".[210] Gill-Webb later pleaded not guilty to a charge of using threatening words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress at Stratford Magistrates' Court.[211] He was later found guilty.[212]\n\n\nIran lodged a formal complaint with the International Olympic Committee after they claimed that the logo spelt the word 'Zion'.[213] The complaint was dismissed by the president of the IOC, Jacques Rogge, who said that the complaint \"can't be serious.\"[214]\n\n\n\n## Drug testing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games § 2012 London\n\nIt was announced before the Summer Games that half of all the competitors would be tested for drugs, with 150 scientists set to take 6,000 samples between the start of the Games and the end of the Paralympic Games.[215] Every competitor who won a medal was also tested. The Olympic laboratory tested up to 400 samples every day for more than 240 prohibited substances.[215] As of late 2022, 40 medals have been stripped due to doping violations, 17 of which were originally awarded to Russian athletes. Testing for drugs was completed by GSK (GlaxoSmithKline).[216]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2012 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Great Britain\n\t+ 1908 Summer Olympics – London\n\t+ 1948 Summer Olympics – London\n\t+ 2012 Summer Olympics – London\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* 2012 Olympic hunger summit\n* *Twenty Twelve*, a comedy mockumentary featuring a fictional London Olympics committee\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The IOC numbers the Olympiads using Roman numerals.\n2. **^** Athens has also hosted three IOC-organised events, in 1896, 2004 and the Intercalated Games in 1906.

The first event, the group stage in women's football, began on 25 July at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, followed by the opening ceremony on 27 July.[3][4] There were 10,518 athletes from 206 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) who participated in the 2012 Olympics.[5]\n\n\nFollowing a bid headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe and the then-London mayor Ken Livingstone, London was selected as the host city at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore on 6 July 2005, defeating bids from Moscow, New York City, Madrid, and Paris.[6] London became the first city to host the modern Olympics three times,[7][b] having previously hosted the Summer Games in 1908 and 1948.[8][9] Construction for the Games involved considerable redevelopment, with an emphasis on sustainability.[10] The main focus was a new 200-hectare (490-acre) Olympic Park, constructed on a former industrial site in Stratford, East London.[11] The Games also made use of venues that already existed before the bid.[12]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (104). China finished second with a total of 91 medals (38 gold) and Great Britain came third with 65 medals overall (29 gold). Michael Phelps of the United States became the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, winning his 22nd medal.[13] Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Brunei entered female athletes for the first time, meaning that every currently eligible country has now sent a female competitor to at least one Olympic Games.[14] Women's boxing was included for the first time, and the 2012 Games became the first at which every sport had female competitors.[15][16][17]\n\n\nThe Games received considerable praise for their organisation, with the volunteers, the British military and public enthusiasm commended particularly highly.[18][19][20] The Games were described as \"happy and glorious\".[21] The opening ceremony, directed by Academy Award winner Danny Boyle, received widespread acclaim.[22][23] These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Belgian Jacques Rogge, who was succeeded by German Thomas Bach the next year.\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nLondon was chosen over Birmingham to represent Great Britain's bid by the British Olympic Association.\n\n\nBy 15 July 2003—the deadline for interested cities to submit bids to the International Olympic Committee (IOC)—nine cities had submitted bids to host the 2012 Summer Olympics: Havana, Istanbul, Leipzig, London, Madrid, Moscow, New York City, Paris, and Rio de Janeiro.[24] On 18 May 2004, as a result of a scored technical evaluation, the IOC reduced the number of cities to five: London, Madrid, Moscow, New York and Paris.[25] All five submitted their candidate files by 19 November 2004 and were visited by the IOC inspection team during February and March 2005. The Paris bid suffered two setbacks during the IOC inspection visit: a number of strikes and demonstrations coinciding with the visits, and a report that a key member of the bid team, Guy Drut, would face charges over alleged corrupt party political finances.[26]\n\n\nThroughout the process, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, particularly as this was its third bid in recent years. London was initially seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin.[27] Its position began to improve after the appointment of Lord Coe as the new chair of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) on 19 May 2004.[28] In late August 2004, reports predicted a tie between London and Paris.[29]\n\n\nOn 6 June 2005, the IOC released its evaluation reports for the five candidate cities. They did not contain any scores or rankings, but the report for Paris was considered the most positive. London was close behind, having closed most of the gap observed by the initial evaluation in 2004. New York and Madrid also received very positive evaluations.[30] On 1 July 2005, when asked who would win, Jacques Rogge said, \"I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less.\"[31]\n\n\nOn 6 July 2005, the final selection was announced at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore. Moscow was the first city to be eliminated, followed by New York and Madrid. The final two contenders were London and Paris. At the end of the fourth round of voting, London won the right to host the 2012 Games with 54 votes to 50.[32]\n\n\nThe celebrations in London were short-lived, being overshadowed by bombings on London's transport system less than 24 hours after the announcement.[33]\n\n\n\n\n\n**2012 host city election – ballot results**\n| City\n | NOC\n | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** | **Round 4** |\n| London | ![](image) Great Britain | **22** | 27 | **39** | **54** |\n| Paris | ![](image) France | 21 | 25 | 33 | 50\n |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | 20 | **32** | 31 | —\n |\n| New York City | ![](image) United States | 19 | 17 | — | —\n |\n| Moscow | ![](image) Russia | 15 | — | — | —\n |\n|  | **Total ballots** | 97\n | 101\n | 103\n | 104\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympic development\n\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) was created to oversee the staging of the Games, and held its first board meeting on 3 October 2005.[34] The committee, chaired by Lord Coe, was in charge of implementing and staging the Games, while the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), established in April 2006, was in charge of construction of the venues and infrastructure.[34][35]\n\n\nThe Government Olympic Executive (GOE), a unit within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), was the lead government body for coordinating the London 2012 Olympics. It focused on oversight of the Games, cross-programme management, and the London 2012 Olympic Legacy before and after the Games that would benefit London and the wider United Kingdom. The organisation was also responsible for the supervision of the £9.3 billion of public sector funding.[36]\n\n\nIn August 2011, security concerns arose surrounding the hosting of the Olympic Games in London, following the 2011 England riots.[37] Some countries expressed safety concerns,[38] despite the IOC's assurance that the riots would not affect the Games.[39] The IOC's Coordination Commission for the 2012 Games completed its tenth and final visit to London in March 2012. Its members concluded that \"London is ready to host the world this summer\".[40]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\nThe 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games used a mixture of new venues, existing and historic facilities, and temporary facilities, some of them in well-known locations such as Hyde Park and Horse Guards Parade. After the Games, some of the new facilities would be reused in their Olympic form, while others will be resized or relocated.[41]\n\n\nThe majority of venues were divided into three zones within Greater London: the Olympic Zone, the River Zone and the Central Zone. In addition there were a few venues that, by necessity, were outside the boundaries of Greater London, such as the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy some 125 mi (201 km) southwest of London, which hosted the sailing events. The football tournament was staged at several grounds around the UK.[42] Work began on the Park in December 2006, when a sports hall in Eton Manor was pulled down.[43] The athletes' village in Portland was completed in September 2011.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)London Olympic Stadium\nIn November 2004, the 200-hectare (500-acre) Olympic Park plans were revealed.[45] The plans for the site were approved in September 2004 by Tower Hamlets, Newham, Hackney and Waltham Forest.[46] The redevelopment of the area to build the Olympic Park required compulsory purchase orders of property. The London Development Agency was in dispute with London and Continental Railways about the orders in November 2005. By May 2006, 86% of the land had been bought as businesses fought eviction.[47] Residents who opposed the eviction tried to find ways to stop it by setting up campaigns, but they had to leave as 94% of land was bought and the other 6% bought as a £9 billion regeneration project started.[48]\n\n\nThere were some issues with the original venues not being challenging enough or being financially unviable. Both the Olympic road races and the mountain bike event were initially considered to be too easy, so they were eventually scheduled on new locations.[49][50] The Olympic marathon course, which was set to finish in the Olympic stadium, was moved to The Mall, since closing Tower Bridge was deemed to cause traffic problems in central London.[51] North Greenwich Arena 2 was scrapped in a cost-cutting exercise, Wembley Arena being used for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics events instead.[52][53][54][55]\n\n\nTest events were held throughout 2011 and 2012, either through an existing championship such as 2012 Wimbledon Championships or as a specially created event held under the banner of *London Prepares*.[56] Team GB House was the British Olympic Association's operational HQ up to and during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Designed by architects Gebler Tooth on the top floor of an office building in Westfield Stratford City, it combined the team HQ, athletes' \"Friends and Family\" lounge, Press Centre, and VIP lounge.\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Olympic Javelin high-speed service ran between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet, via Stratford.\nIOC's initial evaluation felt that, if transport improvements were delivered in time for the Games, London would cope.[57] Transport for London (TfL) carried out numerous improvements in preparation for 2012, including the expansion of the London Overground's East London Line, upgrades to the Docklands Light Railway and the North London Line, and the introduction of a new \"Javelin\" high-speed rail service.[58] According to Network Rail, an additional 4,000 train services operated during the Games, and train operators ran longer trains during the day.[59] During the Games, Stratford International station was not served by any international services (just as it had not been before the Games),[60] westbound trains did not stop at Hackney Wick railway station,[61] and Pudding Mill Lane DLR station closed entirely during the Games.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Emirates Air Line crosses the River Thames between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks.\nTfL also built a £25 million cable car across the River Thames, called the Emirates Air Line, to link 2012 Olympics venues.[63] It was inaugurated in June 2012 and crosses the Thames between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks, carrying up to 2,500 passengers an hour, cutting journey times between the O2 arena and the ExCeL exhibition centre and providing a crossing every 30 seconds.[64]\n\n\nThe plan was to have 80% of athletes travel less than 20 minutes to their event[65] and 93% of them within 30 minutes of their event.[66] The Olympic Park would be served by ten separate railway lines with a combined capacity of 240,000 passengers per hour.[67] In addition, LOCOG planned for 90% of the venues to be served by three or more types of public transport.[66] Two park-and-ride sites off the M25 with a combined capacity of 12,000 cars were 25 minutes away from the Olympic Park. Another park-and-ride site was planned in Ebbsfleet with a capacity for 9,000 cars where spectators could board a 10-minute shuttle train service.[66] To get spectators to Eton Dorney, four park-and-ride schemes were set up.[68] These Park and Ride services were operated by First Games Transport.[69]\n\n\nTfL defined a network of roads leading between venues as the Olympic Route Network; roads connecting all of the Olympic venues located within London. Many of these roads also contained special \"Olympic lanes\" marked with the Olympic rings—reserved for the use of Olympic athletes, officials, and other VIPs during the Games. Members of the public driving in an Olympic lane were subject to a fine of £130. Additionally, London buses would not include roads with Olympic lanes on their routes.[70][71][72] Concerns were expressed at the logistics of spectators travelling to the events outside London. In particular, the sailing events at Portland had no direct motorway connections, and local roads are heavily congested by tourist traffic in the summer.[73] However, a £77 million relief road connecting Weymouth to Dorchester was built and opened in 2011.[74][75] Some £16 million was put aside for the rest of the improvements.[76]\n\n\nTfL created a promotional campaign and website, *Get Ahead of the Games*, to help provide information related to transport during the Olympics and Paralympics. Through the campaign, TfL also encouraged the use of cycling as a mode of transport.[77] A temporary terminal was created at Heathrow Airport to be used by 10,100 departing athletes after the Games. Up to 35% more bags than normal were expected on 13 August, which was predicted to be the busiest day in the airport's history, according to Nick Cole, head of Olympic and Paralympic planning at Heathrow.\n\n\n\n### Cost and financing[edit]\n\n\nA study from Oxford University found that the sports-related costs of London 2012 amounted to US$15 billion, compared with $4.6 billion for Rio 2016, $40–44 billion for Beijing 2008, and $51 billion for Sochi 2014 (the most expensive Olympics in history). London 2012 went over budget by 76% in real terms, measured from bid to completion. Cost per athlete was $1.4 million.[78] This does not include wider costs for urban and transport infrastructure, which often equal or exceed the sports-related costs.\n\n\nThe costs of staging the Games were separate from those for building the venues and infrastructure and redeveloping the land for the Olympic Park. While the Games were privately funded, the venues and infrastructure were largely financed using public money.\n\n\nAccording to *The Wall Street Journal*, the original budget for the Games was increased to about £9.3 billion (US$15.28 billion) in 2007.[79] The revised figures were announced to the House of Commons on 15 March 2007 by Tessa Jowell. Along with East End regeneration costs, the breakdown was:\n\n\n\n* Building the venues and infrastructure – £5.3 billion\n* Elite sport and Paralympic funding – £400 million\n* Security and policing – £600 million\n* Regeneration of the Lower Lea Valley – £1.7 billion\n* Contingency fund – £2.7 billion\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nUnpaid volunteers known as Games Makers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games.[80] A target of 70,000 volunteers was set as early as 2004.[81] When recruitment took place in 2010, more than 240,000 applications were received.[82] Sebastian Coe said in February 2012, \"Our Games Makers will contribute a total of around eight million volunteer hours during the Games and the Games simply wouldn't happen without them\".[83] The volunteers wore clothing that included purple and red polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, grey socks and grey-and-white trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre. Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges that were also worn by officials, athletes, family members and media, which gained them access to specific venues and buildings around the site.\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nOrganisers estimated that some 8 million tickets would be available for the Olympic Games,[84] and 1.5 million tickets for the Paralympic Games.[84] LOCOG aimed to raise £375–£400 million in ticket sales. There were also free events such as marathon, triathlon and road cycling,[85] although, for the first time in Olympic history, the sailing events were ticketed.[86] Eventually, more than 7,000,000 tickets were sold.[87] Following IOC rules, people applied for tickets from the NOC of their country of residence. European Union residents were able to apply for tickets in any EU country.[88]\n\n\nIn Great Britain, ticket prices ranged from £20 for many events to £2,012 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. Some free tickets were given to military personnel as part of the Tickets For Troops scheme,[89] as well as to survivors and families of those who died during 7 July 2005 London bombings.[90] Initially, people were able to apply for tickets via a website from 15 March until 26 April 2011. There was a huge demand for tickets, with a demand of more than three times the number of tickets available.[91][92] On 11 May 2012 a round of nearly one million \"second chance\" tickets went on sale over a 10-day period between 23 June and 3 July 2011.[93] About 1.7 million tickets were available for football and 600,000 for other sports, including archery, field hockey, football, judo, boxing and volleyball. Ten sports had sold out by 8 am of the first day.[94]\n\n\n\n### Countdown[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Countdown Clock in Trafalgar Square\nDuring the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympics, the Olympic Flag was formally handed over from the Mayor of Beijing to the Mayor of London. This was followed by a section highlighting London,[95] One month later, the Olympic and Paralympic flags were raised outside the London City Hall.[96]\n\n\nA countdown clock in Trafalgar Square was unveiled, 500 days before the Games.[97][98] It was a two-sided clock with the Paralympic countdown on the other side. The countdown to the start of the Olympics began with a ceremony for the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, Greece.[99]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Security for the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nSee also: Controversies surrounding G4S\n\nThe police led the security operation (named **Operation Olympics** by the Ministry of Defence), with 10,000 officers available, supported by 13,500 members of the British Armed Forces. Naval and air assets were deployed as part of the security operation, including ships situated in the Thames, Typhoon fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles;[100] it was the biggest security operation Britain had faced in decades. The cost of security increased from £282 million to £553 million, and the figure of 13,500 armed forces personnel was greater than the number deployed at the time in Afghanistan.[101] The Metropolitan Police and the Royal Marines carried out security exercises in preparation for the Olympics on 19 January 2012, with 50 marine police officers in rigid inflatables and fast response boats, joined by up to 100 military personnel and a Royal Navy Lynx helicopter.[102]\n\n\nThe Ministry of Defence distributed leaflets to residents of the Lexington building in Bow, announcing that a missile system was to be stationed on top of the water tower.[103][104] This caused concern to some residents.[103][104] The Ministry said it probably would use Starstreak missiles and that site evaluations had taken place, but that no final decision had taken place.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Front of the Silver Medal won by the USA.\nApproximately 4,700[105] Olympic and Paralympic medals were produced by the Royal Mint at Llantrisant.[106] They were designed by David Watkins (Olympics) and Lin Cheung (Paralympics).[107] 99% of the gold, silver and copper was donated by Rio Tinto from a mine in Salt Lake County, Utah in the U.S.[108] The remaining 1% came from a Mongolian mine.[109] Each medal weighs 375–400 g (13.2–14.1 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 7 mm (0.28 in) thick, with the sport and discipline engraved on the rim.[110] The obverse, as is traditional, features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, stepping from the Panathinaiko Stadium that hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, with Parthenon in the background; the reverse features the Games logo, the River Thames and a series of lines representing \"the energy of athletes and a sense of pulling together\".[111] The medals were transferred to the Tower of London vaults on 2 July 2012 for storage.[110]\n\n\nEach gold medal is 92.5 percent silver and 1.34 percent gold, with the remainder copper. The silver medal is 92.5 percent silver, with the remainder copper. The bronze medal is made up of 97 percent copper, 2.5 percent zinc, and 0.5 per cent tin.[112] The value of the materials in the gold medal was about £410 (US$644), the silver about £210 (US$330), and the bronze about £3 (US$4.71) as of 30 July 2012.[113]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\nThe Olympics torch relay ran from 19 May to 27 July 2012, before the Games. Plans for the relay were developed in 2010–11, with the torch-bearer selection process announced on 18 May 2011.[114] The torch was designed by Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby.\n\n\nOn 18 May 2012 the Olympic flame arrived at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall from Greece[115] on flight BA2012, operated by a British Airways Airbus A319 named \"Firefly\". The relay lasted 70 days, with 66 evening celebrations and six island visits, and involved some 8,000 people carrying the torch about 8,000 mi (12,875 km), starting from Land's End in Cornwall.[116] The torch had three days outside the United Kingdom when it visited the Isle of Man on 2 June, Dublin in Ireland, on 6 June,[117] and both Guernsey and Jersey on 15 July.\n\n\nThe relay focused on National Heritage Sites, locations with sporting significance, key sporting events, schools registered with the Get Set School Network, green spaces and biodiversity, Live Sites (city locations with large screens), and festivals and other events.[118] Dumfries and Galloway was the only Region in the whole of the United Kingdom that had the Olympic Torch pass through it twice. A group of young athletes, nominated by retired Olympic athletes, ran the torch around the stadium. These torchbearers were Callum Airlie, Jordan Duckitt, Desiree Henry, Katie Kirk, Cameron MacRitchie, Aidan Reynolds, and Adelle Tracey. Together the torchbearers each lit a petal that spread the fire to the 204 petals of the cauldron, representing the countries that participated in the Games.[119] The cauldron was designed by Thomas Heatherwick.\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nThe Olympic Park was planned to incorporate 45 hectares of wildlife habitat, with a total of 525 bird boxes and 150 bat boxes. Local waterways and riverbanks were enhanced as part of the process.[120] Renewable energy also featured at the Olympics. It was originally planned to provide 20% of the energy for the Olympic Park and Village from renewable technologies; however, only 9% of it was achieved.[121] Proposals to meet the original target included large-scale on-site wind turbines and hydroelectric generators in the River Thames. These plans were scrapped for safety reasons.[122] The focus subsequently moved to installing solar panels on some buildings, and providing the opportunity to recover energy from waste. Where it could not be reused or recycled, food packaging for use at the Olympics—including fast-food wrappers, sandwich boxes and drink cartons—was made from compostable materials like starch and cellulose-based bioplastics. After use, many of these materials were suitable for anaerobic digestion (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy.[123]\n\n\nPost-Games, buildings like the Water Polo Arena were relocated elsewhere. Building parts like roofing covers and membranes of different temporary venues were recycled via VinyLoop. This allowed organisers to meet the standards of the Olympic Delivery Authority concerning environmental protection.\n\n\nLondon 2012 inaugurated Olympic Games guidelines that included the recycling of PVC, which was used for temporary buildings such as the Basketball Arena and for the temporary parts of permanent venues such as the Olympic Stadium.[124] In the Water Polo Arena, PVC roofing was made from recycled cushions to provide insulation.[125] Through this recycling process, the Olympic Games PVC Policy was fulfilled; the policy states:[126]\n\n\n\nWhere London 2012 procures PVC for temporary usage or where permanent usage is not assured, London 2012 is required to ensure that there is a take-back scheme that offers a closed-loop reuse system or mechanical recycling system for post-consumer waste.\nAccording to Kirsten Henson, Materials Manager for the London 2012 Olympic Park: \"The majority of temporary facilities created for the Olympic Games including the Aquatic centre temporary stands, basketball arena, Water Polo Arena, and the shooting facilities at the Royal Artillery Barracks, are essentially big tents. Basically, PVC stretched over lightweight steel frame. This design solution makes them efficient to install, reduces the need for any significant foundations and are, of course, reusable. We were challenged by the public around the use of PVC; but we considered it to be the right material for certain functions. We therefore challenged the PVC supply chain to have certain environmental performance criteria in place, including a take back and recycle scheme.\"[127]\n\n\n\n### Cultural Olympiad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Cultural Olympiad\n\n![](image)Tower Bridge was illuminated with the Olympic Rings in the week leading up to the opening ceremony.\nThe Olympic Charter, the set of rules and guidelines for the organization of the Olympic Games and for governing the Olympic Movement, states that\n\n\n\n\n> LOCOG shall organise a programme of cultural events which must cover at least the entire period during which the Olympic Village is open.[128]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Cultural Olympiad comprised many programmes, with more than 500 events spread over four years across the whole of the United Kingdom, and culminating in the London 2012 Festival.[129][130]\n\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and 2012 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)Fireworks at the opening ceremony\nTitled \"The Isles of Wonder\", the opening ceremony began at 21:00 British Summer Time (UTC+1) on 27 July in the Olympic Stadium.[131] Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle was artistic director and Rick Smith of Underworld was musical director.[132] The opening ceremony was immediately seen as a tremendous success, widely praised as a \"masterpiece\" and \"a love letter to Britain\".[133][134] The principal sections of the artistic display represented Britain's Industrial Revolution, National Health Service, literary heritage, popular music and culture, and were noted for their vibrant storytelling and use of music.\n\n\nThe Games were officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.[135] This was the second Olympic Games opened personally by the Queen, the first being in 1976 in Montreal, Canada. The ceremony featured a short comic film starring Daniel Craig as secret agent James Bond and the Queen as herself.[136] There was also a musical comedy item starring Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean playing along with the London Symphony Orchestra.[137] These were widely ascribed to Britain's sense of humour.[138]\n\n\nLive musical performers included Frank Turner, Dame Evelyn Glennie, Mike Oldfield, Dizzee Rascal, Arctic Monkeys, and Sir Paul McCartney who performed \"Hey Jude\" as the closing act.[139][140] Broadcast live on BBC One, the ceremony attracted a peak viewing audience of over 27 million in the UK.[141]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers\n\nThe closing ceremony was held on 12 August. It featured a flashback fiesta to British music with The Who closing the performance. The ceremony also included a handover of the Olympic flag by Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, to Eduardo Paes, Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, the host city of the 2016 Summer Olympics.[142] In his closing address, Jacques Rogge described the Games as \"happy and glorious\".[21]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Number of participating

acquired at least one medal: gold, silver or bronze)[143] surpassing the 1948 Summer Olympics in London and the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester as the largest multi-sport event ever to be held in the United Kingdom.[144]\n\n\nThree athletes from the Netherlands Antilles, which whose territory was dissolved in 2010 and lost its recognition during 123rd IOC session held during July 2011, and one athlete from South Sudan, which their NOC was recognized in 2015, participated as two independent athletes teams under the Olympic flag.[145]\n\n\n\n| Participating National Olympic Committees

countries and continents had a \"national house\". These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout London.[147][148]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Nation | Location | Name\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| African nations | Kensington Gardens |\n| Austria | Trinity House |\n| Belgium | Inner Temple |\n| Brazil | Somerset House | Casa Brasil\n |\n| Canada | Canada House |\n| China | The Waldorf Hilton |\n| Croatia | Pelham Hotel, South Kensington |\n| Czech Republic | Business Design Centre, Islington |\n| Denmark | St Katherine Docks |\n| France | Old Billingsgate | Club France\n |\n| Georgia | Chelsea College of Art and Design (45 Millbank)\n |\n| Germany | Museum of London Docklands | Deutsches Haus\n |\n| Great Britain | Westfield Stratford City |\n| Ireland | The Big Chill House, Kings Cross |\n| Italy | Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre | Casa Italia\n |\n| Japan | Royal Aeronautical Society |\n| Jamaica | The O2 |\n| Kenya | East Thames Community Centre, Stratford |\n| Korea | Royal Thames Yacht Club |\n| Monaco | Haymarket |\n| Netherlands | Alexandra Palace | Holland Heineken House |\n| New Zealand | Granary Square, Kings Cross | Kiwi House\n |\n| Nigeria | Theatre Royal Stratford East |\n| Poland | Polish Social and Cultural Centre |\n| Qatar | Institution of Engineering and Technology, Savoy Place |\n| Romania | 30 Pavilion Road, Knightsbridge |\n| Russia | Perks Field, Kensington Palace |\n| Slovakia | Institute of Directors |\n| South Africa | Queen Elizabeth Hall |\n| South Pacific | St Katharine Docks |\n| Switzerland | Glazier's Hall |\n| Trinidad & Tobago | Tricycle Theatre |\n| USA | Royal College of Art |\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe 2012 Summer Olympics featured 26 different sports encompassing 39 disciplines and 302 events. In the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2012 Summer Olympics Sports Programme\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aquatics\n\t+ ![](image) Diving (8)\n\t+ ![](image) Swimming (34)\n\t+ ![](image) Synchronized swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (4)\n* ![](image) Athletics (47)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* ![](image) Basketball (2)\n* ![](image) Boxing (13)\n | * ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n* ![](image) Cycling (competitors)\n\t+ BMX (2)\n\t+ Mountain biking (2)\n\t+ Road (4)\n\t+ Track (10)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n | * ![](image) Fencing (10)\n* ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n* ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (14)\n* ![](image) Modern pentathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Rowing (14)\n* ![](image) Sailing (10)\n | * ![](image) Shooting (15)\n* ![](image) Table tennis (4)\n* ![](image) Taekwondo (8)\n* ![](image) Tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (15)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (11)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (7)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\nWomen's boxing was included in the programme for the first time, and 36 women competed in three weight classes. There was a special dispensation for the shooting events, which would otherwise have been illegal under UK gun law.[149][150] In tennis, mixed doubles returned to the Olympic programme for the first time since 1924.[151]\n\n\nLondon's bid featured the same 28 sports that had been included in other recent Summer Olympics, but the IOC voted to drop baseball and softball from the 2012 Games just two days after London had been selected as the host city. There was an appeal, but the IOC voted to uphold the decision, and the two sports were scheduled to be discontinued after their last appearance at the 2008 Olympics.[152] The IOC then voted on whether or not to replace them; karate, squash, golf, roller sports and rugby sevens were considered. Karate and squash were the two final nominees, but neither received enough votes to reach the required two-thirds majority.[152]\n\n\nAlthough formal demonstration sports were eliminated after the 1992 Summer Olympics,[153] special tournaments for non-Olympic sports can be run during the Games, such as the Wushu tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics.[154] There were attempts to run Twenty20 cricket[154] and netball[155] tournaments alongside the 2012 Games, but neither campaign was successful.\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2012 Summer

Records[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mo Farah (left) with Usain Bolt (right), demonstrating one another's famous gestures (the \"Lightning Bolt\" and \"Mobot\")\nMain article: World and Olympic records set at the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nThese Olympic Games resulted in 32 world records in eight sports. The largest number of records were set in swimming, at eight. China, Great Britain and the United States set the most records, at five each.\n\n\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nFurther information: List of 2012 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nA total of 85 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) won medals, 54 of those countries winning at least one gold medal. Seven NOCs won their first ever Olympic medal: Bahrain (gold),[157] Botswana (silver),[158] Cyprus (silver),[159] Gabon (silver),[160] Grenada (gold),[161] Guatemala (silver),[162] and Montenegro (silver).[163] The United States finished at the top of the table, winning 47 gold medals and a total of 104 medals. China finished second with 38 gold medals and 91 medals overall, and hosts Great Britain came in third place, winning 29 gold medals and 65 medals overall in their best performance since London hosted its first Summer Olympics in 1908, pushing Russia—who won 18 gold medals and 66 medals in total, after doping redistributions (initially 24 gold and 82 total)—into fourth place.\n\n\n\nKey\n  ‡   Changes in medal standings (see subpage)\n\n\n\n  \\*   Host nation (Great Britain)\n\n\n\n2012 Summer Olympics medal table[164]| Rank | NOC | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) United States‡ | 48 | 26 | 30 | 104 |\n| 2 | ![](image) China‡ | 39 | 31 | 22 | 92 |\n| 3 | ![](image) Great Britain\\*‡ | 29 | 18 | 18 | 65 |\n| 4 | ![](image) Russia‡ | 18 | 21 | 26 | 65 |\n| 5 | ![](image) South Korea‡ | 13 | 9 | 9 | 31 |\n| 6 | ![](image) Germany‡ | 11 | 20 | 13 | 44 |\n| 7 | ![](image) France‡ | 11 | 11 | 13 | 35 |\n| 8 | ![](image) Australia‡ | 8 | 15 | 12 | 35 |\n| 9 | ![](image) Italy | 8 | 9 | 11 | 28 |\n| 10 | ![](image) Hungary‡ | 8 | 4 | 6 | 18 |\n| 11–86 | Remaining NOCs | 110 | 141 | 193 | 444 |\n| Totals (86 entries) | 303 | 305 | 353 | 961 |\n\n\n### Podium sweeps[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Sport\n | Event\n | NOC\n | Gold\n | Silver\n | Bronze\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 28 July\n | Fencing | Women's foil | ![](image) Italy | Elisa Di Francisca | Arianna Errigo | Valentina Vezzali |\n| 9 August\n | Athletics | Men's 200 metres | ![](image) Jamaica | Usain Bolt | Yohan Blake | Warren Weir |\n| 11 August\n | Athletics | Women's 20 kilometres walk[165] | ![](image) China | Qieyang Shenjie | Liu Hong | Lü Xiuzhi |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2012 Summer Olympics broadcasters\n\n![](image)Here East, the former London Olympics Media Centre. It now accommodates campuses for Staffordshire University, Loughborough University and University College London an is a location for start-up businesses.[166]\nThe host broadcaster was Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS), an agency of the IOC. The OBS used its own cameras and crews subcontracted from other Olympic broadcasters to cover the events. The base video and audio were sold to other broadcasters, who added their own commentary and presentation.\n\n\nThe official recording format of the 2012 Summer Olympics used Panasonic's digital technologies. The official video was produced and distributed from the International Broadcast Centre in 1080/50i High-Definition (HD) format. Panasonic announced that DVCPRO HD would be the official recording format. OBS London used P2 HD shoulder-mount camcorders.[167]\n\n\nThe IOC wanted television coverage to reach as broad a worldwide audience as possible, and several national and regional broadcasters covered London 2012. In the UK, the BBC carried the Olympics and Channel 4 the Paralympics. The BBC aimed to broadcast all 5,000 hours of the Games.[168] BBC Parliament's Freeview channel was suspended, BBC Three's on-air time was extended so that it could show Olympic events in the daytime, and 24 additional BBC Olympics channels were available via cable, satellite and the internet in the UK.\n\n\nThe US television rights, owned by NBC, accounted for more than half the rights revenue for the IOC. Despite high viewership, many viewers were disappointed with NBC's coverage.[169] The operations of broadcasters granted rights to the Games were hosted in the dedicated International Broadcast Centre inside the security cordon of the Olympic Park. YouTube planned to stream the Games in 64 territories in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa where there were no official broadcasters.[170]\n\n\nIn Sri Lanka a dispute occurred between Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) and MBC Networks (MTV/MBC) as to who was the official broadcaster of the Games. This problem was caused as Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) had offered the official broadcasting rights to both networks, as both of the networks were ABU members. So SLRC filed a case against MBC Networks for broadcasting rights at the Colombo Magistrate's Court. Considering the case, the court issued a special court order preventing MBC Networks' Olympic broadcast and stated that SLRC should be the sole broadcaster.[171] However, when the Games started, both networks broadcast most of the events simultaneously. Another dispute had previously occurred between Carlton Sports Network (CSN) and SLRC, but the Sports Minister, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, had stated that SLRC had the exclusive rights.[172]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Golden Rings Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2012, the IOC announced the winners of the Golden Ring Awards for the best broadcast coverage of the Games. Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to the sailing, produced by Christopher Lincoln, Gary Milkis, and Ursula Romero. The production for the canoe/kayak slalom and the rowing/canoe sprint came second and third respectively. The award for Best On Air Promotion went to NBC with Foxtel and ZDF finishing second and third. NBC Olympics also won the Best Olympic Feature category, as Sky Italia came second and ZDF third. The Best Athlete Profile award went to TV Record's profile of Sarah Menezes, NBC came second with their profile of David Rudisha, and ESPN Latin America took third place with a profile of Miguel Correa and Ruben Rezola. The award for Best Olympic Programme went to NBC, host broadcasters the BBC took second place for Super Saturday (the middle Saturday of the Games), and third place was claimed by the Nine Network for their live coverage of Day 16 of the Games.[173]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n\"Survival\" by Muse was announced as the official song of the Olympics,[174] to be played by international broadcasters reporting on the Games.[175] The track was noted to express a sense of conviction and determination to win.[176] In August 2009, the Royal Mail commissioned artists and illustrators to design 30 stamps, which were released in batches of 10 between 2009 and 2011.[177] The last ones were released on 22 July 2011.[178] Two £5 coins designed by Saiman Miah have been made to commemorate the Olympics.[179] As with other Olympics since 1952, the Royal Mint will strike a set of commemorative one-kilogram gold and silver coins.[180]\n\n\n\n### Motto[edit]\n\n\nThe official motto for the 2012 Summer Olympics is \"Inspire a generation\". It was chosen to highlight the organisers' commitment to inspire the world, including younger generations, to get involved in sporting events through the Games' legacy.[181]\n\n\n\n### Logo and graphics[edit]\n\n\nThere have been two London 2012 logos: one used for the bidding process, and the other used in the branding for the Games themselves. The bid logo, created by Kino Design, was a ribbon with blue, yellow, black, green, and red stripes winding through the text \"LONDON 2012\", making the shape of the River Thames in East London. The main logo, designed by Wolff Olins and published on 4 June 2007, is a representation of the number 2012, with the Olympic Rings embedded within the zero.[182]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Paralympics logo (far left) and the different official colour combinations for the Wolff Olins main logo design\n\nPublic reaction to the main logo in a June 2007 BBC poll was largely mixed; more than 80% of votes gave it the lowest possible rating.[183] Several newspapers ran their own logo competitions, displaying alternative submissions from their readers,[184] and several writers from news agencies criticised the logo.[184][185][186] It was suggested that the logo resembled the American cartoon characters Lisa Simpson and Bart Simpson performing fellatio.[187][188] In February 2011, Iran threatened to boycott the Olympics, complaining that the logo appeared to spell out the word \"Zion\". However, this boycott did not occur.[189]\n\n\n\n### Colours[edit]\n\n\n     The four main colours used in the branding of the Games were pink, blue, green, and orange. These colours were chosen to showcase the spirit of the Games: energetic, spirited, youthful, and bright.\n\n\n    The auxiliary colours used in the branding were dark purple, grey, and gold. These were mostly used in symbols and graphics to offset the brightness of the main colours.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wenlock and Mandeville\n\n![](image)The Olympic Mascots, Mandeville (left) and Wenlock (right)\nThe official mascots for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games were unveiled on 19 May 2010, targeted for children.[190] Wenlock and Mandeville are animations depicting two drops of steel from a steelworks in Bolton.[190]\n\n\nThey are named after Much Wenlock, a town in Shropshire that holds a forerunner of the current Olympic Games, and Stoke Mandeville, a village in Buckinghamshire where a forerunner of the Paralympic Games was first held.[190] The writer Michael Morpurgo wrote the story concept for the mascots, and an animation was produced.[191] Two stories have been created about the mascots: *Out Of A Rainbow* and *Adventures On A Rainbow*.[192]\n\n\n*Creative Review* magazine liked the mascots,[193] but elsewhere their design was greeted with some disdain. However, the mascots' creators claim that young people find the duo appealing.[194]\n\n\n\n### *Chariots of Fire*[edit]\n\n\nThe 1981 Best Picture Oscar–winning film *Chariots of Fire*, which tells the story of two British athletes in the 1924 Olympics, was a recurring theme in promotions for the 2012 Olympics.[195] A digitally re-mastered version of *Chariots of Fire* was released on 13 July 2012 and screened in over 100 UK cinemas as part of the celebrations,[196] and a 2012 stage adaptation ran in London theatres from 9 May 2012 to 5 January 2013.[197] The film's theme tune was performed during the opening ceremony by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Simon Rattle. The performance was accompanied by a comedic skit by Rowan Atkinson, which included the opening beach-running footage from the film.[198] A new orchestration of the film's theme tune was played during each medal presentation of the Games.[199]\n\n\n\n### Sponsors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics marketing § Sponsors\n\nLOCOG and the IOC agreed sponsorship deals with several companies, each assigned to one of four categories; worldwide, tier one, tier two and tier three.[200] The worldwide partners were: Acer, Atos, Coca-Cola, Dow, General Electric, McDonald's, Omega SA, Panasonic, Procter & Gamble, Samsung and Visa.[200] Tier one partners were: Adidas, BMW, BP, British Airways, BT Group, EDF Energy and Lloyds TSB.[201] The tier two partners were: Adecco, ArcelorMittal, Cadbury, Deloitte, Thomas Cook Group, Cisco Systems and United Parcel Service.[201] Tier three partners were: Aggreko, Airwave, Atkins, The Boston Consulting Group, CBS Outdoor, Crystal CG, Eurostar, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, G4S, GlaxoSmithKline, Gymnova, Heathrow Airport, Heineken, Holiday Inn, John Lewis & Partners, McCann Worldgroup, Mondo, Nature Valley, Next, Nielsen Company, Populous (company), Rapiscan Systems, Rio Tinto (corporation), Technogym, Thames Water, Ticketmaster, Trebor and Westfield Group.[201] The companies provided £1.4 billion of funding altogether, allocated evenly between the IOC and LOCOG.[201]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Controversies at the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nDuring the lead-up to the Games, there were controversies over sponsorship,[202] the athletes' use of social media, and several political issues. After a complicated lottery process, thousands of people failed to secure seats for the events they wanted, but a large number of empty seats were observed throughout the Games, even at some of the most popular events. There was speculation that this was due to a failure of corporate sponsors to make use of tickets they had received.[87]\n\n\nDuring the Games, eight competitors in the badminton women's doubles were disqualified for \"not using best efforts\", when they tried to lose matches in the group stage to obtain more favourable fixtures in the knockout rounds.[203][204] A number of results in boxing, gymnastics and judo were overturned by officials after initial decisions were appealed against.[205][206][207]\n\n\nYe Shiwen faced doping allegations after her gold medal in the women's 400m Individual Medley as she came from being behind the world record in the final 50m to beating it by 1.02 seconds. Furthermore, she swam her last 50m 0.17 seconds quicker than the men's winner of the corresponding race. All charges were later dropped.[208]\n\n\nJust before the start of the Men's 100m Final, a spectator threw a plastic bottle into Tyson Gay's lane, intended to hit Usain Bolt who was three lanes outside in Lane 7. The race was unaffected, and Bolt would go on to become the second man in history to defend a 100m Olympic title. The spectator, later identified as Ashley Gill-Webb, was soon arrested after he was struck on the head by Dutch judoka and bronze medalist Edith Bosch, whom he happened to be sitting next to.[209][210] LOCOG Chairman Sebastian Coe later stated: \"I'm not suggesting vigilantism, but it was actually poetic justice that they happened to be sitting next to a judo player\".[210] Gill-Webb later pleaded not guilty to a charge of using threatening words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress at Stratford Magistrates' Court.[211] He was later found guilty.[212]\n\n\nIran lodged a formal complaint with the International Olympic Committee after they claimed that the logo spelt the word 'Zion'.[213] The complaint was dismissed by the president of the IOC, Jacques Rogge, who said that the complaint \"can't be serious.\"[214]\n\n\n\n## Drug testing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games § 2012 London\n\nIt was announced before the Summer Games that half of all the competitors would be tested for drugs, with 150 scientists set to take 6,000 samples between the start of the Games and the end of the Paralympic Games.[215] Every competitor who won a medal was also tested. The Olympic laboratory tested up to 400 samples every day for more than 240 prohibited substances.[215] As of late 2022, 40 medals have been stripped due to doping violations, 17 of which were originally awarded to Russian athletes. Testing for drugs was completed by GSK (GlaxoSmithKline).[216]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2012 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Great Britain\n\t+ 1908 Summer Olympics – London\n\t+ 1948 Summer Olympics – London\n\t+ 2012 Summer Olympics – London\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* 2012 Olympic hunger summit\n* *Twenty Twelve*, a comedy mockumentary featuring a fictional London Olympics committee\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The IOC numbers the Olympiads using Roman numerals.\n2. **^** Athens has also hosted three IOC-organised events, in 1896, 2004 and the Intercalated Games in 1906.

Rio de Janeiro was announced as the host city at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2 October 2009.\n\n\n11,238 athletes from 207 nations took part in the 2016 Games, including first-time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team.[2][3] With 306 sets of medals, the Games featured 28 Olympic sports, including rugby sevens and golf, which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city and at five separate venues in the Brazilian cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília, and Manaus.\n\n\nThese were the first Olympic Games to be held in South America,[4] as well as the first to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first summer edition to be held entirely in the host country's winter season, the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America (the second being 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, Argentina), and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.[5] These were also the first Summer Olympics to take place under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach.[3]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (121); the US team also won its 1,000th Summer Olympic gold medal overall. Great Britain finished second and became the first country to increase its tally of medals in the Olympiad immediately after being host nation in 2012.[6] China finished third in the medal table. Host nation Brazil won seven gold medals and 19 medals, its best result at any Olympics, finishing in thirteenth place. Bahrain, Fiji, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Tajikistan and Vietnam all won their first gold medals, as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes (from Kuwait).\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\n![](image)A young girl adding her signature in support of Rio de Janeiro's candidacy.\n![Several people dressed in formal attire sit behind a bench. There are repeated graphics behind them.](image)The bid committee, led by Carlos Arthur Nuzman, giving a press conference.\nThe bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympics was officially launched on 16 May 2007.[7] The first step for each city was to submit an initial application to the International Olympic Committee by 13 September 2007, confirming their intention to bid. Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14 January 2008. On 4 June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities—Baku, Doha, and Prague—failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers. Others included lack of infrastructures, including beds for athletes and media reporters at that time.[8]\n\n\nNawal El Moutawakel of Morocco headed the 10-member Evaluation Commission, having also chaired the evaluation commission for the 2012 Summer Olympics bids, which was awarded to London, United Kingdom. The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009. They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2 September, one month before the elections.[9]\n\n\nMany safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. For example, cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift. Nonetheless, bidding cities invested large sums in their PR and media programs to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support and backing from sports media and general international media.\n\n\n\n\n> Ultimately, you are communicating with just 115 people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about 1,500 people, perhaps 5,000 in the broadest sense. It is not just about getting ads out there but it is about a targeted and very carefully planned campaign.\n> \n> — Jon Tibbs, a consultant on the Tokyo bid[10]\n> \n\n\nThe final voting was held in Copenhagen on 2 October 2009, with Madrid and Rio de Janeiro considered favorites to secure the Games. Chicago was eliminated after the first round of voting, and Tokyo after the second (The latter city would eventually awarded the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2013). Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid, heading into the final round; the lead was held, and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n2016 Summer Olympics bidding results[11]\n| **City** | **NOC** | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** |\n|  **Rio de Janeiro** |  **![](image) Brazil** | 26\n | **46** | **66** |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | **28** | 29\n | 32\n |\n| Tokyo | ![](image) Japan | 22\n | 20\n | —\n |\n| Chicago | ![](image) United States | 18\n | —\n | —\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nOn 26 June 2011, it was reported on AroundTheRings.com that Roderlei Generali, the COO of the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, resigned just one year after taking the job at ROOC. This came just five months after CCO Flávio Pestana quit for personal reasons.[12] Pestana withdrew later during the 2012 Summer Paralympics, and Renato Ciuchin was then appointed as COO.[13]\n\n\n\n### Venues and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nEvents took place at eighteen existing venues, nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games, and seven temporary venues.[14]\n\n\nFor the events held in Rio de Janeiro, each event was held in one of four geographically segregated Olympic clusters–Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã–as was done for the 2007 Pan American Games.[15][16] Several of the venues were located at the Barra Cluster Olympic Park.[14] Nearly half of the athletes could reach their venues in less than 10 minutes, and almost 75 per cent could do so in less than 25 minutes. Of the 34 competition venues, eight underwent some permanent works, seven were totally temporary and nine were constructed as permanent legacy venues.[17]\n\n\nThe largest venue at the Games in terms of seating capacity was the 74,738-seat Maracanã Stadium, which served as the ceremonies venue and site of the football finals.[14] The second largest stadium was the 60,000-seat Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which hosted track and field events.[14] The athletes' village was said to be the largest in Olympic history. Fittings included about 80,000 chairs, 70,000 tables, 29,000 mattresses, 60,000 clothes hangers, 6,000 television sets and 10,000 smartphones.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Olympic Park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Barra Olympic Park\n\n![](image)Barra Olympic Park\nThe Barra Olympic Park is a cluster of nine sporting venues in Barra da Tijuca, in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The site was formerly occupied by the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet, also known as the Jacarepaguá Formula One circuit.[19]\n\n\nThe nine venues within the Olympic Park were:[20][21]\n\n\n\n* Carioca Arena 1 – basketball (capacity: 16,000)\n* Carioca Arena 2 – wrestling, judo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Carioca Arena 3 – fencing, taekwondo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Future Arena – handball (capacity: 12,000)\n* Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre – diving, synchronized swimming, water polo (capacity: 5,000)\n* Olympic Aquatics Stadium – swimming, water polo play-offs (capacity: 15,000)\n* Olympic Tennis Centre – tennis (capacity: 10,000 Main Court)\n* Rio Olympic Arena – gymnastics (capacity: 12,000)\n* Rio Olympic Velodrome – track cycling (capacity: 5,000)\n\n\n#### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nAs well as the Estádio Olímpico João Havelange and Maracanã and in Rio de Janeiro, football matches took place at five venues in the cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília and Manaus.\n\n\n\n* ![Maracanã Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nMaracanã Stadium  \nRio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Olympic Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nOlympic Stadium   \n Rio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Arena da Amazônia Manaus, AM](image)\n\nArena da Amazônia  \nManaus, AM\n* ![Arena Corinthians São Paulo, SP](image)\n\nArena Corinthians  \nSão Paulo, SP\n* ![Arena Fonte Nova Salvador, BA](image)\n\nArena Fonte Nova  \nSalvador, BA\n* ![Estádio Nacional Brasília, DF](image)\n\nEstádio Nacional  \nBrasília, DF\n* ![Mineirão Belo Horizonte, MG](image)\n\nMineirão  \nBelo Horizonte, MG\n\n\n### Urban renovation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Port of Rio de Janeiro\n\n![](image)Mauá Square, with the Museum of Tomorrow, designed by Santiago Calatrava, and the light rail.\nRio's historical downtown underwent an urban waterfront revitalization project known as *Porto Maravilha*, covering 5 km2 (1.9 sq mi) in area. The project aimed to redevelop the port area, increase the city center's attractiveness, and enhance Rio's competitive position in the global economy.[22]\n\n\nThe urban renovation involved 700 km (430 mi) of public networks for water supply, sanitation, drainage, electricity, gas and telecom; 4 km (2.5 mi) of tunnels; 70 km (43 mi) of roads; 650 km2 (250 sq mi) of sidewalks; 17 km (11 mi) of bike path; 15,000 trees; and three sanitation treatment plants. As part of this renovation, a new tram was built from the Santos Dumont Airport to Rodoviária Novo Rio, due to open in April 2016.[23]\n\n\nThe Games required over 200 kilometers of security fencing. A 15,000 square meter warehouse in Barra da Tijuca was used to assemble and supply the furniture and fittings for the Olympic Village. The second warehouse of 90,000 square meters in Duque de Caxias, near the roads that provide access to the venues, contained all the equipment needed for the sporting events.[18]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nThe medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian mint). The medal design was unveiled on 15 June 2016. They were designed to be environmentally friendly using recycled materials; the bronze and silver medals contained 30% recycled materials. The gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria, such as being extracted without the use of mercury. The medals feature a wreath design on the front, and in keeping with tradition, the obverse features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. A wooden carrying box accompanied each medal. Medalists were also awarded a trophy in the shape of the Games' emblem.[24][25]\n\n\nIn May 2017, an Associated Press article disclosed that over 100 athletes who had won medals at the Rio Olympics reported that their medals were showing some damage, including black spots, flaking, or surface degrading. Rio officials offered to replace any defective medals and found problems with 6 to 7 percent of all those awarded.[26]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\n![](image)Basketball player Anderson Varejão carrying the torch in São Paulo\n![](image)Volunteers working at the Olympic Stadium during the Games\nThe Olympic flame was lit on 21 April 2016 at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, the traditional start of the Greek phase of the torch relay. The flame was handed over to the Brazilian organisers in a ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens on 27 April. A brief stop-off was made in Switzerland to visit the IOC headquarters and the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, as well as the United Nations Office at Geneva.[27]\n\n\nThe torch relay began its journey around Brazil on 3 May at the capital Brasília. The flame visited more than 300 Brazilian cities, including all 26 state capitals and the Brazilian Federal District.[28] The relay ended in Rio de Janeiro on 5 August when the flame was used to light the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony.\n\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nUnpaid volunteers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games. A target of 50,000 volunteers was set as early as 2012. More than 240,000 applications were received when recruitment took place in 2014. The clothing worn by the volunteers included yellow polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, white socks, and green trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre. Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges which were allocated to officials, athletes, family members, and media, allowing them to gain access to specific venues and buildings around the site.[29] Many volunteers gave up their roles due to long working hours and insufficient free meals.[30]\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nThe ticket prices were announced on 16 September 2014, all of which were sold in Brazilian reais (BRL). A total of 7.5 million tickets were to be sold in total, with ticket prices ranging from BRL 40 for many events to BRL 4,600 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. About 3.8 million of these tickets were available for BRL 70 or less.[31][32]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Future Arena, a temporary venue designed for future reconstruction into school buildings\nAs an aspect of its bid, Rio's organizing committee planned to focus on sustainability and environmental protection as a theme of the 2016 Games, going on to dub them a \"Green Games for a Blue Planet\".[33] As legacy projects, organizers intended to introduce a wider array of public transport options, upgrade the infrastructure of the favelas to provide improved transport and access to utilities, upgrade Rio's sewer system to remediate the level of pollution in the Guanabara Bay,[33][34] and plant 24 million seedlings to offset the expected carbon emissions of the Games. However, some of these projects met with delays or faced economic shortfalls, leading some critics to believe that Rio would not be able to accomplish them.[33][35]\n\n\nThe focus on environmental protection also influenced the implementation of certain Olympic protocols. To reduce emissions, the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations, using a kinetic sculpture to enhance its appearance in place of a larger body of flames.[36] The bronze and silver medals, as well as the ribbons on all medals, were designed to incorporate recycled materials.[24][25] The athletes were not presented with flowers during the medal ceremonies, as had been the tradition at previous Olympics (although floral displays were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations). The organizers considered the practice to be wasteful because the flowers were often thrown away and \"would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate\" if kept. The podiums were designed using materials that could be recycled to make furniture.[25][37]\n\n\nThe Future Arena, the venue for the handball competitions, was designed as a temporary modular structure whose components could be reconstructed after the Games to build schools.[38] However, as of November 2017, the arena was still standing due to lack of funds to dismantle it and no allocation of funds to do so in the 2018 budget.[39] Portions of the opening ceremony were dedicated to the issue of climate change.[40]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and 2016 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)A scene from the opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony took place at Maracana Stadium on 5 August 2016, directed by Fernando Meirelles, Daniela Thomas, and Andrucha Waddington.[41] The ceremony highlighted aspects of Brazilian history and culture, and featured a segment narrated by Fernanda Montenegro and Judi Dench with an appeal to environmental conservation and the prevention of global warming.[40][42] The crowd in the stadium numbered 60,000 and the event was broadcast to an estimated global audience of three billion.[4]\n\n\nThe ceremony included the inaugural presentation of the Olympic Laurel, an honor bestowed by the IOC on those that have made \"significant achievements in education, culture, development and peace through sport\"; the trophy was awarded to Kenyan athlete Kipchoge Keino.[43] The Games were officially opened by the acting president of Brazil, Michel Temer.[44]\n\n\nThe Olympic cauldron was lit by long-distance runner Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima,[4] the men's marathon bronze medalist at the 2004 Olympics, who had also received the IOC's Pierre de Coubertin medal for sportsmanship after being attacked by a spectator and losing his lead in the race.[41][45] The cauldron was originally expected to be lit by Brazilian footballer Pelé, but he declined to participate due to health problems.[42][46][47]\n\n\nFollowing the opening ceremony, a public cauldron was lit in front of the Candelária Church by Jorge Gomes, a 14-year-old Brazilian athlete who had escaped from poverty to train as a runner.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Youth Arena\n![](image)Deodoro Stadium\n![](image)Olympic BMX Centre\n![](image)Olympic Golf Course\nThe 2016 Summer Olympic program featured 28 sports encompassing 306 events.

Baseball and softball (which were both dropped in 2005), karate, squash, golf, roller sports, and rugby union all applied to be included on the programme. Formal presentations were made to the IOC executive board in June 2009.[50]\n\n\nIn August, the executive board initially gave its approval to rugby sevens—a seven-player version of rugby union—by a majority vote; baseball/softball, roller sports, and squash were removed from contention, leaving golf, karate, and rugby sevens in the running. A final vote was held on 9 October 2009, the closing day of the 121st IOC Session. At this session, a new voting system was in place: a sport now needed only a simple majority from the full IOC committee for approval rather than the two-thirds majority previously required.[51][52]\n\n\nThe 121st IOC Session decided to add rugby sevens and golf to the Rio 2016 Olympic programme.[53] The tally for rugby was 81 in favor, with eight against,[54] and golf was approved by 63 votes to 26.[55] Neither of these two sports was new to the Summer Olympics; rugby last featured in 1924, and golf in 1904.\n\n\nIn May 2012, the International Sailing Federation announced that windsurfing would be replaced by kitesurfing at the 2016 Olympics,[56] but this decision was reversed in November.[57]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rio 2016 Olympic Village\nAll 205 National Olympic Committees qualified at least one athlete.[*citation needed*] The first three nations to qualify athletes for the Games were Germany, Great Britain, and the Netherlands, who each qualified four athletes for the team dressage by winning medals in the team event at the 2014 FEI World Equestrian Games.[58]\n\n\nAs host nation, Brazil received automatic entry for some sports including in all cycling disciplines and six places for weightlifting events.[59][60]\n\n\nThe 2016 Summer Olympics were the first Games in which Kosovo and South Sudan were eligible to participate. Bulgarian and Russian weightlifters were banned from Rio Olympics for numerous anti-doping violations.[61][62]\n\n\nKuwait was banned in October 2015 for the second time in five years over government interference in the country's Olympic committee.[63]\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Country by team size\n![](image)Participating countries color code  \nBlue = Participated for the first time in 2016.  \n Green

crisis and other reasons, the IOC allowed athletes to compete as Independent Olympians under the Olympic Flag. During the previous Summer Olympic Games, refugees were ineligible to compete because of their inability to represent their home NOCs.[64] On 2 March 2016, the IOC finalized plans for a specific Refugee Olympic Team (ROT); out of 43 refugee athletes deemed potentially eligible, 10 were chosen to form the team.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Independent athletes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nDue to the suspension of the National Olympic Committee of Kuwait, participants from Kuwait were allowed to participate under the Olympic Flag as Independent Olympic Athletes.\n\n\nIn November 2015, Russia was provisionally suspended from all international track and field athletic competitions by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) following a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report into a doping program in the country.[66] The IAAF announced that it would allow individual Russian athletes to apply for \"exceptional eligibility\" to participate in the Games as \"neutral\" athletes if it was independently verified that they had not engaged in doping nor in the Russian doping program.[67]\n\n\nOn 24 July 2016, the IOC rejected the IAAF and WADA's recommendations to allow athletes to compete neutrally, stating that the Olympic Charter \"does not foresee such 'neutral athletes'\" and that it was each country's National Olympic Committee decision on which athletes would be competing.[68] As a result, Russian athletes competed under the Russian flag, although they would compete under a neutral flag in the 2018 Winter Olympics following several developments concerning the doping investigation.\n\n\n\n#### National houses[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Games, some countries and continents had a national house. These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro.[69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Nation | Location | Name\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Africa House |

the 2016 Summer Olympics. The records were set in archery, athletics, canoeing, cycling track, modern pentathlon, rowing, shooting, swimming, and weightlifting.\n\n\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The public cauldron, located outside the Candelária Church\nA number of events, most notably in aquatics, beach volleyball and track and field, were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as 10:00 p.m. to midnight BRT. These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC, whose substantial rights fees are one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC, who therefore allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible (on 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through 2032, including US$1.23 billion for Rio 2016),[71][72] as well as the main Brazilian rightsholder Rede Globo. As Brasília time is only one hour ahead of the U.S. Eastern Time Zone, certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U.S. primetime hours (traditionally 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. ET, 9:00 p.m. to midnight BRT), allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being delayed. This practice was also beneficial to Globo; a Brazilian critic noted that the network very rarely preempts its primetime telenovelas, as they are among the highest-rated programs in the country.[73][74][75][76]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers\n\n![](image)2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony at Maracanã Stadium\nThe closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics was held on 21 August 2016 from 20:00 to 22:50 BRT at the Maracanã Stadium.[77] As per traditional Olympic protocol, the ceremony featured cultural presentations from both the current (Brazil) and following (Japan) host countries, as well as closing remarks by IOC president Thomas Bach, who declared the Games closed, and the Games' organizing committee leader Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the official handover of the Olympic flag from Rio de Janeiro mayor Eduardo Paes to Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, whose city will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, and the extinguishing of the Olympic flame.[78]\n\n\nThe creative director for the ceremony was Rosa Magalhães.[79] Amid heavy rainfall, the ceremony began with interpretive dancers representing various landmarks in the host city. Martinho da Vila then performed a rendition of \"Carinhoso [pt]\" by Pixinguinha. In another segment, introducing the athletes, singer Roberta Sá channeled Carmen Miranda, the fruit-headdress-wearing, mid-century Hollywood diva who endures as a beloved camp figure. The Parade of Flags followed shortly after a choir of 27 children, representing the states of Brazil, sang the Brazilian national anthem.\n\n\n\n### Cost[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium\nThe Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimated the out-turn cost of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics at US$4.6 billion in 2015-dollars. This figure included sports-related costs, that is, (i) *operational costs* incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, of which the largest components were technology, transportation, workforce, and administration costs, while other operational costs included security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) *direct capital costs* incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which were required to host the Games.[80]\n\n\nIndirect capital costs were not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, for hotel upgrades, or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Rio Olympics' cost of US$4.6 billion compares with costs of US$40–44 billion for Beijing 2008 and US$51 billion for Sochi 2014, the two most expensive Olympics in history. The average cost of the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion.[80]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBarra Olympic Park\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nFurther information: List of 2016 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by the number of gold medals are listed below.

Produced from a total of seven mobile units, OBS distributed 40,000 hours of television footage and 60,000 hours of digital footage of the Games to its international rightsholders. For the first time in Olympic history, digital-oriented footage exceeded the amount of television-oriented footage. The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in the Barra da Tijuca cluster.[81] NHK and OBS once again filmed portions of the Games, including the opening ceremony and selected events, in 8K resolution video. Additionally, expanding upon a 180-degree trial at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, 85 hours of video content were originated in 360-degree virtual reality formats.[82] In the United States, NBC offered 4K content downconverted from the 8K footage and with HDR and Dolby Atmos support, to participating television providers.[83] Owing to their expertise in domestic broadcasts of the new sports introduced in Rio, Golf Channel and Sky New Zealand staff handled the production of the golf and rugby sevens events on behalf of OBS.[81]\n\n\nIn August 2009, the IOC reached a deal to sell domestic broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics to Grupo Globo. Replacing Record, the deal covers free-to-air coverage on Rede Globo, pay TV, and digital rights to the Games. In turn, Globo sublicensed partial free-to-air rights to Rede Record, along with Rede Bandeirantes. IOC board member Richard Carrión described the agreement as \"unprecedented\", touting that \"by working with Brazil's leading media organizations, we are confident that this represents a great deal for Olympic fans in the region. There will be a huge increase in the amount of Olympic action broadcast, both during and outside Games time, and Brazilians will have more choice of how, when and where they follow their Olympic Games.\"[84]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Golden Rings Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic rings displayed in Rio de Janeiro\nIn November 2017, the International Olympic Committee announced the winners of the Golden rings in six categories for the best broadcast coverage of the Games. The Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to Beach Volleyball, produced by Geoff Johnson and directed by Greg Breakell and Gary Milkis. The production for the cycling road race and Sailing came second and third. The next category was the best Olympic feature, for which TV Globo's show *Esporte Espetacular* finished third, and CCTV from China feature *A Sequel of Love* came second. The winner was NBC Olympics for their feature *The Most Beautiful Thing*. The third category was The Best Athlete Profile, for which RTBF from Belgium collected the third place prize for their profile of Nafi Thiam. TV Globo went one better than the previous category coming second with their profile of Isaquias Queiroz. The winner of the category again was NBC, this time for their piece on Wayde van Niekerk. The Best On-Air Promotion was announced next, with the BBC Sport winning with NBC coming second this time and BNT from Bulgaria finishing third. The Best Olympic Digital Service went to NBC, with ZDF and SporTV/Globosat picking up the second and third places. The Best Olympic Programme was awarded to SporTV/Globosat, while TV Globo and BBC Sport completed the podium.[85]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vinicius and Tom\n\n![](image)Vinicius (left), the mascot of the Rio 2016, and Tom (right), the mascot of the 2016 Summer Paralympics\nOn 24 November 2014, the official mascots of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled, created by Sao Paulo-based animation company Birdo.[86] The Olympic mascot Vinicius, named after musician Vinicius de Moraes, represents Brazilian wildlife and carries design traits of cats, monkeys, and birds.[86] According to their fictional backgrounds, the mascots \"were both born from the joy of Brazilians after it was announced that Rio would host the Games\".[87]\n\n\nBrand director Beth Lula stated that the mascots were intended to reflect the diversity of Brazil's culture and people.[88] The names of the mascots were determined by a public vote whose results were announced on 14 December 2014. The names, which reference the co-writers of the song \"The Girl from Ipanema\", won over two other sets of names, tallying 44 percent of 323,327 votes.[89] At the Olympic wrestling events, coaches were given plush dolls of Vinicius to throw into the ring when they wished to challenge a referee's call.[90]\n\n\n\n### Emblem[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sculpture of the *Rio 2016* logo in Barra Olympic Park\nThe official emblem for the 2016 Summer Olympics was designed by Brazilian agency Tatíl Design and was unveiled on 31 December 2010, winning in a competition against 139 agencies.[91] The emblem represents three figures joined at their arms and feet, with the overall shape reflecting that of Sugarloaf Mountain. It was also designed to have a three-dimensional form, which designer Fred Gelli claimed made it the first 3D logo in the history of the Olympics.[92]\n\n\nThe logo has been noted as evoking Henri Matisse's painting *Dance*. There were also allegations by the Colorado-based Telluride Foundation that the logo had been plagiarized from its own; while also consisting of several figures linked in motion, the Telluride Foundation logo contains four figures. This was not the first time that the foundation had alleged plagiarism of its logo by a Brazilian event; in 2004, the linked figures element had been copied for the logo of Carnival celebrations in Salvador. Gelli defended the allegations, stating that the concept of figures linked in embrace was not inherently original, as it was \"an ancient reference\" and \"in the collective unconscious\". Gelli cited *Dance* as an influence of the logo's concept and stated that the designers had intentionally aimed to make the interpretation of the concept as dissimilar to others as possible.[93]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nThe lead-up to the Rio Games was marked by several controversies, including: Brazil's political and economic crisis; the Zika virus epidemic; the significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay; and an ongoing doping scandal involving Russia, which affected the participation of Russian athletes in the Games. However, the Zika virus was not contracted by anyone competing in or attending the Olympics,[94] and the Games went ahead normally with no major incident.[95][96][97]\n\n\n\n### Political and economic crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014 Brazilian economic crisis, Operation Car Wash, and Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff\n\n![](image)Suspended president Dilma Rousseff during an interview with Al Jazeera at the Alvorada Palace on 1 June 2016\nIn 2014, Operation Car Wash, an investigation by the Federal Police of Brazil, uncovered unprecedented money laundering and corruption at the state-controlled oil company Petrobras. In early 2015, a series of protests against alleged corruption by the government of President Dilma Rousseff began in Brazil, triggered by revelations that numerous politicians were involved in the Petrobras affair. By early 2016, the scandal had escalated into a full-blown political crisis affecting not only President Rousseff, but also former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, resulting in widespread demonstrations involving millions of protesters,[98] both anti- and pro-Rousseff.[99][100] At the same time, Brazil faced its worst economic recession since the 1990s, raising questions about whether the country was adequately prepared to host the Olympic Games against a volatile political and economic backdrop. On 12 May 2016, President Rousseff was stripped of her powers and duties for 180 days after an impeachment vote in the Federal Senate, with Vice President Michel Temer standing in as acting president during the Games.[101]\n\n\nOn 5 October 2017, Brazilian Olympic Committee head Carlos Nuzman was arrested amid a money-laundering investigation into a $2 million payment that was allegedly made to secure votes for the bid to bring the Olympics to Rio. The money was believed to have been paid to former IAAF president Lamine Diack and his son Papa Massata Diack, who was a member of the IOC at the time of the alleged payment, which was three days before the vote in 2009. All three were charged with money laundering, along with the former Rio state governor Sergio Cabral (who was already in prison for money laundering offenses at the time), Brazilian businessman Arthur Soares, and ex-Brazilian Olympic Committee chief Leonardo Gryner. All six were charged with running a criminal organization, money laundering, and violating currency laws in their own native countries.[102] On 4 July 2019, it was reported that Cabral told a judge that the money paid to Diack was used to buy as many as nine votes.[103] Rio mayor Eduardo Paes was also accused of corruption and fraud in relation to the construction of a number of venues for the Games.[104][105]\n\n\n\n### Zika virus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2015–16 Zika virus epidemic\n\n![](image)Agent for endemic diseases of the city of Votuporanga, São Paulo\nAn outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil raised fears regarding its potential impact on athletes and visitors. To prevent puddles of stagnant water that allow mosquitoes to breed, organizers announced plans to perform daily inspections of Olympic venues.[106] Zika virus transmission was also attributed to inefficient sewage treatment in the area, an issue that was also in the process of being addressed for the Games.[107]\n\n\nIn May 2016, a group of 150 physicians and scientists sent an open letter to the World Health Organization (WHO), calling upon them to, according to co-author Arthur Caplan, have \"an open, transparent discussion of the risks of holding the Olympics as planned in Brazil\". The WHO dismissed the request, stating that \"cancelling or changing the location of the 2016 Olympics [would] not significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus\", and that there was \"no public health justification\" for postponing them.[108][109][110]\n\n\nSome athletes did not attend the Games because of the epidemic.[111][112] On 2 September 2016, however, the World Health Organization reported that there were no confirmed cases of Zika among athletes or visitors during the 2016 Olympics.[113]\n\n\n\n### Environmental problems[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environmental issues in Brazil and Water supply and sanitation in Brazil\n\n![](image)Fort Copacabana hosted the cycling road race (start and finish), marathon swimming and triathlon events.\nThe Guanabara Bay, whose waters were used for sailing and windsurfing competitions, is heavily polluted. Among the chief causes of the pollution are uncollected trash fed into the bay via polluted rivers and slums along the coast. Pollution of the Guanabara has been a long-term issue. At the Earth Summit in 1992, officials promised they would begin to address the pollution, but previous attempts to do so have been insufficient. As an aspect of their bid for the Games, Rio once again committed to making efforts towards cleaning the bay.[114][115] However, some of these proposed initiatives have faced budgetary issues.[34] Prior to these efforts, only 17% of Rio's sewage was treated;[116] this raw sewage also leaked into the bay. Although Rio mayor Eduardo Paes stated that the city might not be able to reach its goal of having 80% of sewage treated,[117] at least 60% of sewage was treated by March 2016, with a projected goal of 65% of sewage being treated by the start of the Olympics.[118]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Crime in Brazil and Terrorism in Brazil\n\n![](image)F-5EM Tiger II fighter jet of the Brazilian Air Force during an air intercept training for Rio 2016\nRio's crime problems also received renewed attention after it was awarded the 2016 Games; mayor Paes stated that the city was facing \"big issues\" in heightening security, but that such concerns and issues were presented to the IOC throughout the bidding process.[119]\n\n\nThe governor of Rio de Janeiro also highlighted the fact that London faced security problems, with a terrorist attack occurring just a day after it was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics. The estimate was that 5,000 men of the National Public Security Force and 22,000 military officers (14,800 Army; 5,900 Navy and 1,300 of the Brazilian Air Force), in addition to the fixed quota of Rio January, would act during the Olympic Games.[120]\n\n\nOn 21 July 2016, two weeks before the scheduled start of the Games, the Brazilian Federal Police broke up an Islamic jihadist terrorist ring by arresting 12 people.[121]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping scandal[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Doping in Russia and McLaren Report\n\n![](image)Headquarters of the Russian Olympic Committee in Moscow\nIn December 2014, media attention began growing when German broadcaster ARD reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to doping in East Germany. In November 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report, and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events. The United Kingdom Anti-Doping agency later assisted WADA with testing in Russia. In June 2016, they reported they were unable to fully carry out their work, and noted intimidation by armed Federal Security Service (FSB) agents.[122] After a Russian former lab director made allegations about the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by Richard McLaren, which found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the Ministry of Sport and the FSB had operated a \"state-directed failsafe system\" using a \"disappearing positive [test] methodology\" (DPM) from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\".[123]\n\n\nIn response to these findings, WADA announced that RUSADA should be regarded as non-compliant with respect to the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[124] The IOC rejected the recommendation, stating that the IOC and each sport's international federation would make decisions on each athlete's individual basis.[125][126] A day before the opening ceremony, 278 athletes were cleared to compete under the Russian flag, while 111 were removed because of doping.[127] In contrast, the entire Kuwaiti team was banned from competing under their own flag for a non-doping related matter.[128][129] Unlike the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee after it found evidence that the DPM was also in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics.[130]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2016 Summer Paralympics\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The official logo of the 2016 Summer Olympics was made in 3D design, made by Brazilian design company Tàtil Design; it was inspired by Brazil's rich history of festivals and its colorful people; it also symbolizes energy, passion and unity.

Rio de Janeiro was announced as the host city at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2 October 2009.\n\n\n11,238 athletes from 207 nations took part in the 2016 Games, including first-time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team.[2][3] With 306 sets of medals, the Games featured 28 Olympic sports, including rugby sevens and golf, which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city and at five separate venues in the Brazilian cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília, and Manaus.\n\n\nThese were the first Olympic Games to be held in South America,[4] as well as the first to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first summer edition to be held entirely in the host country's winter season, the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America (the second being 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, Argentina), and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.[5] These were also the first Summer Olympics to take place under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach.[3]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (121); the US team also won its 1,000th Summer Olympic gold medal overall. Great Britain finished second and became the first country to increase its tally of medals in the Olympiad immediately after being host nation in 2012.[6] China finished third in the medal table. Host nation Brazil won seven gold medals and 19 medals, its best result at any Olympics, finishing in thirteenth place. Bahrain, Fiji, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Tajikistan and Vietnam all won their first gold medals, as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes (from Kuwait).\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\n![](image)A young girl adding her signature in support of Rio de Janeiro's candidacy.\n![Several people dressed in formal attire sit behind a bench. There are repeated graphics behind them.](image)The bid committee, led by Carlos Arthur Nuzman, giving a press conference.\nThe bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympics was officially launched on 16 May 2007.[7] The first step for each city was to submit an initial application to the International Olympic Committee by 13 September 2007, confirming their intention to bid. Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14 January 2008. On 4 June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities—Baku, Doha, and Prague—failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers. Others included lack of infrastructures, including beds for athletes and media reporters at that time.[8]\n\n\nNawal El Moutawakel of Morocco headed the 10-member Evaluation Commission, having also chaired the evaluation commission for the 2012 Summer Olympics bids, which was awarded to London, United Kingdom. The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009. They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2 September, one month before the elections.[9]\n\n\nMany safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. For example, cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift. Nonetheless, bidding cities invested large sums in their PR and media programs to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support and backing from sports media and general international media.\n\n\n\n\n> Ultimately, you are communicating with just 115 people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about 1,500 people, perhaps 5,000 in the broadest sense. It is not just about getting ads out there but it is about a targeted and very carefully planned campaign.\n> \n> — Jon Tibbs, a consultant on the Tokyo bid[10]\n> \n\n\nThe final voting was held in Copenhagen on 2 October 2009, with Madrid and Rio de Janeiro considered favorites to secure the Games. Chicago was eliminated after the first round of voting, and Tokyo after the second (The latter city would eventually awarded the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2013). Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid, heading into the final round; the lead was held, and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n2016 Summer Olympics bidding results[11]\n| **City** | **NOC** | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** |\n|  **Rio de Janeiro** |  **![](image) Brazil** | 26\n | **46** | **66** |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | **28** | 29\n | 32\n |\n| Tokyo | ![](image) Japan | 22\n | 20\n | —\n |\n| Chicago | ![](image) United States | 18\n | —\n | —\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nOn 26 June 2011, it was reported on AroundTheRings.com that Roderlei Generali, the COO of the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, resigned just one year after taking the job at ROOC. This came just five months after CCO Flávio Pestana quit for personal reasons.[12] Pestana withdrew later during the 2012 Summer Paralympics, and Renato Ciuchin was then appointed as COO.[13]\n\n\n\n### Venues and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nEvents took place at eighteen existing venues, nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games, and seven temporary venues.[14]\n\n\nFor the events held in Rio de Janeiro, each event was held in one of four geographically segregated Olympic clusters–Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã–as was done for the 2007 Pan American Games.[15][16] Several of the venues were located at the Barra Cluster Olympic Park.[14] Nearly half of the athletes could reach their venues in less than 10 minutes, and almost 75 per cent could do so in less than 25 minutes. Of the 34 competition venues, eight underwent some permanent works, seven were totally temporary and nine were constructed as permanent legacy venues.[17]\n\n\nThe largest venue at the Games in terms of seating capacity was the 74,738-seat Maracanã Stadium, which served as the ceremonies venue and site of the football finals.[14] The second largest stadium was the 60,000-seat Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which hosted track and field events.[14] The athletes' village was said to be the largest in Olympic history. Fittings included about 80,000 chairs, 70,000 tables, 29,000 mattresses, 60,000 clothes hangers, 6,000 television sets and 10,000 smartphones.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Olympic Park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Barra Olympic Park\n\n![](image)Barra Olympic Park\nThe Barra Olympic Park is a cluster of nine sporting venues in Barra da Tijuca, in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The site was formerly occupied by the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet, also known as the Jacarepaguá Formula One circuit.[19]\n\n\nThe nine venues within the Olympic Park were:[20][21]\n\n\n\n* Carioca Arena 1 – basketball (capacity: 16,000)\n* Carioca Arena 2 – wrestling, judo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Carioca Arena 3 – fencing, taekwondo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Future Arena – handball (capacity: 12,000)\n* Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre – diving, synchronized swimming, water polo (capacity: 5,000)\n* Olympic Aquatics Stadium – swimming, water polo play-offs (capacity: 15,000)\n* Olympic Tennis Centre – tennis (capacity: 10,000 Main Court)\n* Rio Olympic Arena – gymnastics (capacity: 12,000)\n* Rio Olympic Velodrome – track cycling (capacity: 5,000)\n\n\n#### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nAs well as the Estádio Olímpico João Havelange and Maracanã and in Rio de Janeiro, football matches took place at five venues in the cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília and Manaus.\n\n\n\n* ![Maracanã Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nMaracanã Stadium  \nRio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Olympic Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nOlympic Stadium   \n Rio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Arena da Amazônia Manaus, AM](image)\n\nArena da Amazônia  \nManaus, AM\n* ![Arena Corinthians São Paulo, SP](image)\n\nArena Corinthians  \nSão Paulo, SP\n* ![Arena Fonte Nova Salvador, BA](image)\n\nArena Fonte Nova  \nSalvador, BA\n* ![Estádio Nacional Brasília, DF](image)\n\nEstádio Nacional  \nBrasília, DF\n* ![Mineirão Belo Horizonte, MG](image)\n\nMineirão  \nBelo Horizonte, MG\n\n\n### Urban renovation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Port of Rio de Janeiro\n\n![](image)Mauá Square, with the Museum of Tomorrow, designed by Santiago Calatrava, and the light rail.\nRio's historical downtown underwent an urban waterfront revitalization project known as *Porto Maravilha*, covering 5 km2 (1.9 sq mi) in area. The project aimed to redevelop the port area, increase the city center's attractiveness, and enhance Rio's competitive position in the global economy.[22]\n\n\nThe urban renovation involved 700 km (430 mi) of public networks for water supply, sanitation, drainage, electricity, gas and telecom; 4 km (2.5 mi) of tunnels; 70 km (43 mi) of roads; 650 km2 (250 sq mi) of sidewalks; 17 km (11 mi) of bike path; 15,000 trees; and three sanitation treatment plants. As part of this renovation, a new tram was built from the Santos Dumont Airport to Rodoviária Novo Rio, due to open in April 2016.[23]\n\n\nThe Games required over 200 kilometers of security fencing. A 15,000 square meter warehouse in Barra da Tijuca was used to assemble and supply the furniture and fittings for the Olympic Village. The second warehouse of 90,000 square meters in Duque de Caxias, near the roads that provide access to the venues, contained all the equipment needed for the sporting events.[18]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nThe medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian mint). The medal design was unveiled on 15 June 2016. They were designed to be environmentally friendly using recycled materials; the bronze and silver medals contained 30% recycled materials. The gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria, such as being extracted without the use of mercury. The medals feature a wreath design on the front, and in keeping with tradition, the obverse features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. A wooden carrying box accompanied each medal. Medalists were also awarded a trophy in the shape of the Games' emblem.[24][25]\n\n\nIn May 2017, an Associated Press article disclosed that over 100 athletes who had won medals at the Rio Olympics reported that their medals were showing some damage, including black spots, flaking, or surface degrading. Rio officials offered to replace any defective medals and found problems with 6 to 7 percent of all those awarded.[26]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\n![](image)Basketball player Anderson Varejão carrying the torch in São Paulo\n![](image)Volunteers working at the Olympic Stadium during the Games\nThe Olympic flame was lit on 21 April 2016 at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, the traditional start of the Greek phase of the torch relay. The flame was handed over to the Brazilian organisers in a ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens on 27 April. A brief stop-off was made in Switzerland to visit the IOC headquarters and the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, as well as the United Nations Office at Geneva.[27]\n\n\nThe torch relay began its journey around Brazil on 3 May at the capital Brasília. The flame visited more than 300 Brazilian cities, including all 26 state capitals and the Brazilian Federal District.[28] The relay ended in Rio de Janeiro on 5 August when the flame was used to light the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony.\n\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nUnpaid volunteers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games. A target of 50,000 volunteers was set as early as 2012. More than 240,000 applications were received when recruitment took place in 2014. The clothing worn by the volunteers included yellow polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, white socks, and green trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre. Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges which were allocated to officials, athletes, family members, and media, allowing them to gain access to specific venues and buildings around the site.[29] Many volunteers gave up their roles due to long working hours and insufficient free meals.[30]\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nThe ticket prices were announced on 16 September 2014, all of which were sold in Brazilian reais (BRL). A total of 7.5 million tickets were to be sold in total, with ticket prices ranging from BRL 40 for many events to BRL 4,600 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. About 3.8 million of these tickets were available for BRL 70 or less.[31][32]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Future Arena, a temporary venue designed for future reconstruction into school buildings\nAs an aspect of its bid, Rio's organizing committee planned to focus on sustainability and environmental protection as a theme of the 2016 Games, going on to dub them a \"Green Games for a Blue Planet\".[33] As legacy projects, organizers intended to introduce a wider array of public transport options, upgrade the infrastructure of the favelas to provide improved transport and access to utilities, upgrade Rio's sewer system to remediate the level of pollution in the Guanabara Bay,[33][34] and plant 24 million seedlings to offset the expected carbon emissions of the Games. However, some of these projects met with delays or faced economic shortfalls, leading some critics to believe that Rio would not be able to accomplish them.[33][35]\n\n\nThe focus on environmental protection also influenced the implementation of certain Olympic protocols. To reduce emissions, the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations, using a kinetic sculpture to enhance its appearance in place of a larger body of flames.[36] The bronze and silver medals, as well as the ribbons on all medals, were designed to incorporate recycled materials.[24][25] The athletes were not presented with flowers during the medal ceremonies, as had been the tradition at previous Olympics (although floral displays were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations). The organizers considered the practice to be wasteful because the flowers were often thrown away and \"would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate\" if kept. The podiums were designed using materials that could be recycled to make furniture.[25][37]\n\n\nThe Future Arena, the venue for the handball competitions, was designed as a temporary modular structure whose components could be reconstructed after the Games to build schools.[38] However, as of November 2017, the arena was still standing due to lack of funds to dismantle it and no allocation of funds to do so in the 2018 budget.[39] Portions of the opening ceremony were dedicated to the issue of climate change.[40]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and 2016 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)A scene from the opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony took place at Maracana Stadium on 5 August 2016, directed by Fernando Meirelles, Daniela Thomas, and Andrucha Waddington.[41] The ceremony highlighted aspects of Brazilian history and culture, and featured a segment narrated by Fernanda Montenegro and Judi Dench with an appeal to environmental conservation and the prevention of global warming.[40][42] The crowd in the stadium numbered 60,000 and the event was broadcast to an estimated global audience of three billion.[4]\n\n\nThe ceremony included the inaugural presentation of the Olympic Laurel, an honor bestowed by the IOC on those that have made \"significant achievements in education, culture, development and peace through sport\"; the trophy was awarded to Kenyan athlete Kipchoge Keino.[43] The Games were officially opened by the acting president of Brazil, Michel Temer.[44]\n\n\nThe Olympic cauldron was lit by long-distance runner Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima,[4] the men's marathon bronze medalist at the 2004 Olympics, who had also received the IOC's Pierre de Coubertin medal for sportsmanship after being attacked by a spectator and losing his lead in the race.[41][45] The cauldron was originally expected to be lit by Brazilian footballer Pelé, but he declined to participate due to health problems.[42][46][47]\n\n\nFollowing the opening ceremony, a public cauldron was lit in front of the Candelária Church by Jorge Gomes, a 14-year-old Brazilian athlete who had escaped from poverty to train as a runner.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Youth Arena\n![](image)Deodoro Stadium\n![](image)Olympic BMX Centre\n![](image)Olympic Golf Course\nThe 2016 Summer Olympic program featured 28 sports encompassing 306 events.

Baseball and softball (which were both dropped in 2005), karate, squash, golf, roller sports, and rugby union all applied to be included on the programme. Formal presentations were made to the IOC executive board in June 2009.[50]\n\n\nIn August, the executive board initially gave its approval to rugby sevens—a seven-player version of rugby union—by a majority vote; baseball/softball, roller sports, and squash were removed from contention, leaving golf, karate, and rugby sevens in the running. A final vote was held on 9 October 2009, the closing day of the 121st IOC Session. At this session, a new voting system was in place: a sport now needed only a simple majority from the full IOC committee for approval rather than the two-thirds majority previously required.[51][52]\n\n\nThe 121st IOC Session decided to add rugby sevens and golf to the Rio 2016 Olympic programme.[53] The tally for rugby was 81 in favor, with eight against,[54] and golf was approved by 63 votes to 26.[55] Neither of these two sports was new to the Summer Olympics; rugby last featured in 1924, and golf in 1904.\n\n\nIn May 2012, the International Sailing Federation announced that windsurfing would be replaced by kitesurfing at the 2016 Olympics,[56] but this decision was reversed in November.[57]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rio 2016 Olympic Village\nAll 205 National Olympic Committees qualified at least one athlete.[*citation needed*] The first three nations to qualify athletes for the Games were Germany, Great Britain, and the Netherlands, who each qualified four athletes for the team dressage by winning medals in the team event at the 2014 FEI World Equestrian Games.[58]\n\n\nAs host nation, Brazil received automatic entry for some sports including in all cycling disciplines and six places for weightlifting events.[59][60]\n\n\nThe 2016 Summer Olympics were the first Games in which Kosovo and South Sudan were eligible to participate. Bulgarian and Russian weightlifters were banned from Rio Olympics for numerous anti-doping violations.[61][62]\n\n\nKuwait was banned in October 2015 for the second time in five years over government interference in the country's Olympic committee.[63]\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Country by team size\n![](image)Participating countries color code  \nBlue = Participated for the first time in 2016.  \n Green

crisis and other reasons, the IOC allowed athletes to compete as Independent Olympians under the Olympic Flag. During the previous Summer Olympic Games, refugees were ineligible to compete because of their inability to represent their home NOCs.[64] On 2 March 2016, the IOC finalized plans for a specific Refugee Olympic Team (ROT); out of 43 refugee athletes deemed potentially eligible, 10 were chosen to form the team.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Independent athletes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nDue to the suspension of the National Olympic Committee of Kuwait, participants from Kuwait were allowed to participate under the Olympic Flag as Independent Olympic Athletes.\n\n\nIn November 2015, Russia was provisionally suspended from all international track and field athletic competitions by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) following a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report into a doping program in the country.[66] The IAAF announced that it would allow individual Russian athletes to apply for \"exceptional eligibility\" to participate in the Games as \"neutral\" athletes if it was independently verified that they had not engaged in doping nor in the Russian doping program.[67]\n\n\nOn 24 July 2016, the IOC rejected the IAAF and WADA's recommendations to allow athletes to compete neutrally, stating that the Olympic Charter \"does not foresee such 'neutral athletes'\" and that it was each country's National Olympic Committee decision on which athletes would be competing.[68] As a result, Russian athletes competed under the Russian flag, although they would compete under a neutral flag in the 2018 Winter Olympics following several developments concerning the doping investigation.\n\n\n\n#### National houses[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Games, some countries and continents had a national house. These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro.[69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Nation | Location | Name\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Africa House |

the 2016 Summer Olympics. The records were set in archery, athletics, canoeing, cycling track, modern pentathlon, rowing, shooting, swimming, and weightlifting.\n\n\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The public cauldron, located outside the Candelária Church\nA number of events, most notably in aquatics, beach volleyball and track and field, were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as 10:00 p.m. to midnight BRT. These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC, whose substantial rights fees are one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC, who therefore allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible (on 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through 2032, including US$1.23 billion for Rio 2016),[71][72] as well as the main Brazilian rightsholder Rede Globo. As Brasília time is only one hour ahead of the U.S. Eastern Time Zone, certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U.S. primetime hours (traditionally 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. ET, 9:00 p.m. to midnight BRT), allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being delayed. This practice was also beneficial to Globo; a Brazilian critic noted that the network very rarely preempts its primetime telenovelas, as they are among the highest-rated programs in the country.[73][74][75][76]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers\n\n![](image)2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony at Maracanã Stadium\nThe closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics was held on 21 August 2016 from 20:00 to 22:50 BRT at the Maracanã Stadium.[77] As per traditional Olympic protocol, the ceremony featured cultural presentations from both the current (Brazil) and following (Japan) host countries, as well as closing remarks by IOC president Thomas Bach, who declared the Games closed, and the Games' organizing committee leader Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the official handover of the Olympic flag from Rio de Janeiro mayor Eduardo Paes to Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, whose city will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, and the extinguishing of the Olympic flame.[78]\n\n\nThe creative director for the ceremony was Rosa Magalhães.[79] Amid heavy rainfall, the ceremony began with interpretive dancers representing various landmarks in the host city. Martinho da Vila then performed a rendition of \"Carinhoso [pt]\" by Pixinguinha. In another segment, introducing the athletes, singer Roberta Sá channeled Carmen Miranda, the fruit-headdress-wearing, mid-century Hollywood diva who endures as a beloved camp figure. The Parade of Flags followed shortly after a choir of 27 children, representing the states of Brazil, sang the Brazilian national anthem.\n\n\n\n### Cost[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium\nThe Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimated the out-turn cost of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics at US$4.6 billion in 2015-dollars. This figure included sports-related costs, that is, (i) *operational costs* incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, of which the largest components were technology, transportation, workforce, and administration costs, while other operational costs included security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) *direct capital costs* incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which were required to host the Games.[80]\n\n\nIndirect capital costs were not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, for hotel upgrades, or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Rio Olympics' cost of US$4.6 billion compares with costs of US$40–44 billion for Beijing 2008 and US$51 billion for Sochi 2014, the two most expensive Olympics in history. The average cost of the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion.[80]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBarra Olympic Park\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nFurther information: List of 2016 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by the number of gold medals are listed below.

Produced from a total of seven mobile units, OBS distributed 40,000 hours of television footage and 60,000 hours of digital footage of the Games to its international rightsholders. For the first time in Olympic history, digital-oriented footage exceeded the amount of television-oriented footage. The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in the Barra da Tijuca cluster.[81] NHK and OBS once again filmed portions of the Games, including the opening ceremony and selected events, in 8K resolution video. Additionally, expanding upon a 180-degree trial at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, 85 hours of video content were originated in 360-degree virtual reality formats.[82] In the United States, NBC offered 4K content downconverted from the 8K footage and with HDR and Dolby Atmos support, to participating television providers.[83] Owing to their expertise in domestic broadcasts of the new sports introduced in Rio, Golf Channel and Sky New Zealand staff handled the production of the golf and rugby sevens events on behalf of OBS.[81]\n\n\nIn August 2009, the IOC reached a deal to sell domestic broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics to Grupo Globo. Replacing Record, the deal covers free-to-air coverage on Rede Globo, pay TV, and digital rights to the Games. In turn, Globo sublicensed partial free-to-air rights to Rede Record, along with Rede Bandeirantes. IOC board member Richard Carrión described the agreement as \"unprecedented\", touting that \"by working with Brazil's leading media organizations, we are confident that this represents a great deal for Olympic fans in the region. There will be a huge increase in the amount of Olympic action broadcast, both during and outside Games time, and Brazilians will have more choice of how, when and where they follow their Olympic Games.\"[84]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Golden Rings Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic rings displayed in Rio de Janeiro\nIn November 2017, the International Olympic Committee announced the winners of the Golden rings in six categories for the best broadcast coverage of the Games. The Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to Beach Volleyball, produced by Geoff Johnson and directed by Greg Breakell and Gary Milkis. The production for the cycling road race and Sailing came second and third. The next category was the best Olympic feature, for which TV Globo's show *Esporte Espetacular* finished third, and CCTV from China feature *A Sequel of Love* came second. The winner was NBC Olympics for their feature *The Most Beautiful Thing*. The third category was The Best Athlete Profile, for which RTBF from Belgium collected the third place prize for their profile of Nafi Thiam. TV Globo went one better than the previous category coming second with their profile of Isaquias Queiroz. The winner of the category again was NBC, this time for their piece on Wayde van Niekerk. The Best On-Air Promotion was announced next, with the BBC Sport winning with NBC coming second this time and BNT from Bulgaria finishing third. The Best Olympic Digital Service went to NBC, with ZDF and SporTV/Globosat picking up the second and third places. The Best Olympic Programme was awarded to SporTV/Globosat, while TV Globo and BBC Sport completed the podium.[85]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vinicius and Tom\n\n![](image)Vinicius (left), the mascot of the Rio 2016, and Tom (right), the mascot of the 2016 Summer Paralympics\nOn 24 November 2014, the official mascots of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled, created by Sao Paulo-based animation company Birdo.[86] The Olympic mascot Vinicius, named after musician Vinicius de Moraes, represents Brazilian wildlife and carries design traits of cats, monkeys, and birds.[86] According to their fictional backgrounds, the mascots \"were both born from the joy of Brazilians after it was announced that Rio would host the Games\".[87]\n\n\nBrand director Beth Lula stated that the mascots were intended to reflect the diversity of Brazil's culture and people.[88] The names of the mascots were determined by a public vote whose results were announced on 14 December 2014. The names, which reference the co-writers of the song \"The Girl from Ipanema\", won over two other sets of names, tallying 44 percent of 323,327 votes.[89] At the Olympic wrestling events, coaches were given plush dolls of Vinicius to throw into the ring when they wished to challenge a referee's call.[90]\n\n\n\n### Emblem[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sculpture of the *Rio 2016* logo in Barra Olympic Park\nThe official emblem for the 2016 Summer Olympics was designed by Brazilian agency Tatíl Design and was unveiled on 31 December 2010, winning in a competition against 139 agencies.[91] The emblem represents three figures joined at their arms and feet, with the overall shape reflecting that of Sugarloaf Mountain. It was also designed to have a three-dimensional form, which designer Fred Gelli claimed made it the first 3D logo in the history of the Olympics.[92]\n\n\nThe logo has been noted as evoking Henri Matisse's painting *Dance*. There were also allegations by the Colorado-based Telluride Foundation that the logo had been plagiarized from its own; while also consisting of several figures linked in motion, the Telluride Foundation logo contains four figures. This was not the first time that the foundation had alleged plagiarism of its logo by a Brazilian event; in 2004, the linked figures element had been copied for the logo of Carnival celebrations in Salvador. Gelli defended the allegations, stating that the concept of figures linked in embrace was not inherently original, as it was \"an ancient reference\" and \"in the collective unconscious\". Gelli cited *Dance* as an influence of the logo's concept and stated that the designers had intentionally aimed to make the interpretation of the concept as dissimilar to others as possible.[93]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nThe lead-up to the Rio Games was marked by several controversies, including: Brazil's political and economic crisis; the Zika virus epidemic; the significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay; and an ongoing doping scandal involving Russia, which affected the participation of Russian athletes in the Games. However, the Zika virus was not contracted by anyone competing in or attending the Olympics,[94] and the Games went ahead normally with no major incident.[95][96][97]\n\n\n\n### Political and economic crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014 Brazilian economic crisis, Operation Car Wash, and Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff\n\n![](image)Suspended president Dilma Rousseff during an interview with Al Jazeera at the Alvorada Palace on 1 June 2016\nIn 2014, Operation Car Wash, an investigation by the Federal Police of Brazil, uncovered unprecedented money laundering and corruption at the state-controlled oil company Petrobras. In early 2015, a series of protests against alleged corruption by the government of President Dilma Rousseff began in Brazil, triggered by revelations that numerous politicians were involved in the Petrobras affair. By early 2016, the scandal had escalated into a full-blown political crisis affecting not only President Rousseff, but also former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, resulting in widespread demonstrations involving millions of protesters,[98] both anti- and pro-Rousseff.[99][100] At the same time, Brazil faced its worst economic recession since the 1990s, raising questions about whether the country was adequately prepared to host the Olympic Games against a volatile political and economic backdrop. On 12 May 2016, President Rousseff was stripped of her powers and duties for 180 days after an impeachment vote in the Federal Senate, with Vice President Michel Temer standing in as acting president during the Games.[101]\n\n\nOn 5 October 2017, Brazilian Olympic Committee head Carlos Nuzman was arrested amid a money-laundering investigation into a $2 million payment that was allegedly made to secure votes for the bid to bring the Olympics to Rio. The money was believed to have been paid to former IAAF president Lamine Diack and his son Papa Massata Diack, who was a member of the IOC at the time of the alleged payment, which was three days before the vote in 2009. All three were charged with money laundering, along with the former Rio state governor Sergio Cabral (who was already in prison for money laundering offenses at the time), Brazilian businessman Arthur Soares, and ex-Brazilian Olympic Committee chief Leonardo Gryner. All six were charged with running a criminal organization, money laundering, and violating currency laws in their own native countries.[102] On 4 July 2019, it was reported that Cabral told a judge that the money paid to Diack was used to buy as many as nine votes.[103] Rio mayor Eduardo Paes was also accused of corruption and fraud in relation to the construction of a number of venues for the Games.[104][105]\n\n\n\n### Zika virus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2015–16 Zika virus epidemic\n\n![](image)Agent for endemic diseases of the city of Votuporanga, São Paulo\nAn outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil raised fears regarding its potential impact on athletes and visitors. To prevent puddles of stagnant water that allow mosquitoes to breed, organizers announced plans to perform daily inspections of Olympic venues.[106] Zika virus transmission was also attributed to inefficient sewage treatment in the area, an issue that was also in the process of being addressed for the Games.[107]\n\n\nIn May 2016, a group of 150 physicians and scientists sent an open letter to the World Health Organization (WHO), calling upon them to, according to co-author Arthur Caplan, have \"an open, transparent discussion of the risks of holding the Olympics as planned in Brazil\". The WHO dismissed the request, stating that \"cancelling or changing the location of the 2016 Olympics [would] not significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus\", and that there was \"no public health justification\" for postponing them.[108][109][110]\n\n\nSome athletes did not attend the Games because of the epidemic.[111][112] On 2 September 2016, however, the World Health Organization reported that there were no confirmed cases of Zika among athletes or visitors during the 2016 Olympics.[113]\n\n\n\n### Environmental problems[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environmental issues in Brazil and Water supply and sanitation in Brazil\n\n![](image)Fort Copacabana hosted the cycling road race (start and finish), marathon swimming and triathlon events.\nThe Guanabara Bay, whose waters were used for sailing and windsurfing competitions, is heavily polluted. Among the chief causes of the pollution are uncollected trash fed into the bay via polluted rivers and slums along the coast. Pollution of the Guanabara has been a long-term issue. At the Earth Summit in 1992, officials promised they would begin to address the pollution, but previous attempts to do so have been insufficient. As an aspect of their bid for the Games, Rio once again committed to making efforts towards cleaning the bay.[114][115] However, some of these proposed initiatives have faced budgetary issues.[34] Prior to these efforts, only 17% of Rio's sewage was treated;[116] this raw sewage also leaked into the bay. Although Rio mayor Eduardo Paes stated that the city might not be able to reach its goal of having 80% of sewage treated,[117] at least 60% of sewage was treated by March 2016, with a projected goal of 65% of sewage being treated by the start of the Olympics.[118]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Crime in Brazil and Terrorism in Brazil\n\n![](image)F-5EM Tiger II fighter jet of the Brazilian Air Force during an air intercept training for Rio 2016\nRio's crime problems also received renewed attention after it was awarded the 2016 Games; mayor Paes stated that the city was facing \"big issues\" in heightening security, but that such concerns and issues were presented to the IOC throughout the bidding process.[119]\n\n\nThe governor of Rio de Janeiro also highlighted the fact that London faced security problems, with a terrorist attack occurring just a day after it was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics. The estimate was that 5,000 men of the National Public Security Force and 22,000 military officers (14,800 Army; 5,900 Navy and 1,300 of the Brazilian Air Force), in addition to the fixed quota of Rio January, would act during the Olympic Games.[120]\n\n\nOn 21 July 2016, two weeks before the scheduled start of the Games, the Brazilian Federal Police broke up an Islamic jihadist terrorist ring by arresting 12 people.[121]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping scandal[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Doping in Russia and McLaren Report\n\n![](image)Headquarters of the Russian Olympic Committee in Moscow\nIn December 2014, media attention began growing when German broadcaster ARD reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to doping in East Germany. In November 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report, and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events. The United Kingdom Anti-Doping agency later assisted WADA with testing in Russia. In June 2016, they reported they were unable to fully carry out their work, and noted intimidation by armed Federal Security Service (FSB) agents.[122] After a Russian former lab director made allegations about the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by Richard McLaren, which found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the Ministry of Sport and the FSB had operated a \"state-directed failsafe system\" using a \"disappearing positive [test] methodology\" (DPM) from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\".[123]\n\n\nIn response to these findings, WADA announced that RUSADA should be regarded as non-compliant with respect to the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[124] The IOC rejected the recommendation, stating that the IOC and each sport's international federation would make decisions on each athlete's individual basis.[125][126] A day before the opening ceremony, 278 athletes were cleared to compete under the Russian flag, while 111 were removed because of doping.[127] In contrast, the entire Kuwaiti team was banned from competing under their own flag for a non-doping related matter.[128][129] Unlike the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee after it found evidence that the DPM was also in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics.[130]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2016 Summer Paralympics\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The official logo of the 2016 Summer Olympics was made in 3D design, made by Brazilian design company Tàtil Design; it was inspired by Brazil's rich history of festivals and its colorful people; it also symbolizes energy, passion and unity.

Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.[6]\n\n\nOriginally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 on 24 March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled).[7] However, the event retained the *Tokyo 2020* branding for marketing purposes.[8] It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the first and only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators.[c] The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.[10]\n\n\nThe Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice.[d] The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year[12] and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.\n\n\nNew events were introduced in existing sports, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.[13]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 medals. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals.[14][15][16] Burkina Faso, San Marino and Turkmenistan also won their first-ever Olympic medals.[17][18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nThe three candidate cities were Tokyo, Istanbul, and Madrid. The applicant cities of Baku and Doha were not promoted to candidate status. A bid from Rome was withdrawn.[20]\n\n\n\n### Host city selection[edit]\n\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to select the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics on 7 September 2013, at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, using an exhaustive ballot system.[20] None of the candidate cities won more than 50% of the votes in the first round; Madrid and Istanbul were tied for second place, so a runoff vote was held to determine which of the two cities would be eliminated. The final vote was a head-to-head contest between Tokyo and Istanbul. Tokyo was selected by 60 votes to 36, gaining at least the 49 votes required for a majority.[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n2020 Summer Olympics host city election[21]\n| City\n | Team\n | Round 1\n | Runoff\n | Round 2\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tokyo | ![](image) Japan | **42** | —\n | **60** |\n| Istanbul | ![](image) Turkey | 26\n | **49** | 36\n |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | 26\n | 45\n | —\n |\n\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: COVID-19 cases at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics and List of athletes not attending the 2020 Summer Olympics due to COVID-19 concerns\n\nSee also: COVID-19 pandemic in Japan and Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports\n\n![](image)Few pedestrians on the Shibuya Crossing during the state of emergency in the middle of Japan's first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, early 2020\nIn January 2020, concerns were raised about the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on athletes and visitors to the Summer Olympic Games.[22] Tokyo organizers and the International Olympic Committee insisted they were monitoring the spread of the disease to minimize its effects on preparations for the Olympics.[23] The IOC stated that in 2020, their Japanese partners and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \"made it very clear that Japan could not manage a postponement beyond next summer [2021] at the latest\".[24] Unlike the case for Zika virus during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted directly between humans, posing tougher challenges for the organizers to counteract the infectious disease and host a safe and secure event.[22] Also unlike the case for H1N1 \"swine flu\" during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, COVID-19 has a higher fatality rate, and there was no effective vaccine until December 2020.[25] In a February 2020 interview, Conservative London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey argued that London would be able to host the Olympic Games at the former 2012 Olympic venues should the Games need to be moved because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[26] Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike criticized Bailey's comment as inappropriate.[27] In early 2021, officials in the U.S. state of Florida offered to host the delayed Games in their state, while John Coates, the IOC vice president in charge of the Tokyo Olympics, said the Games would open even if the city and other parts of Japan were under a state of emergency because of COVID-19.[28][29]\n\n\nEstimates by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Kyoto University predicted that states of emergency might be required during the Games.[30] The reports published at the Ministry of Health experts' panel also showed new patients increasing to 10,000 if the Games were to allow spectators.[31]\n\n\n\n### Qualifying event cancellation and postponement[edit]\n\n\nConcerns about the pandemic began to affect qualifying events in early 2020. Some that were due to take place in February were moved to alternative locations to address concerns about travelling to the affected areas, particularly China. For example, the women's basketball qualification was played in Belgrade, Serbia, instead of Foshan, China.[32] The Asia & Oceania boxing qualification tournament, which was originally planned to be held from 3–14 February in Wuhan, China (the location of the original outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic), instead took place in Amman, Jordan, at the beginning of March.[33] The third round of the women's football qualification tournament was also affected, as the group matches formerly scheduled to be held in China were moved to Australia.[34] The European boxing qualification began on 14 March 2020 in London, United Kingdom, but was suspended after two days of competition before being rescheduled for April 2021.[35][36] It eventually resumed in June 2021 but was moved to Paris, France,[37] because of renewed concerns over travel to the United Kingdom. Other qualifying events that were due to take place in March to June 2020 began to be postponed until later in the year and mid-2021 as part of a wider suspension of international sporting competitions in response to the pandemic. A multitude of Olympic sports were affected, including archery, baseball, cycling, handball, judo, rowing, sailing, volleyball, and water polo.[38]\n\n\n\n### Effect on doping tests[edit]\n\n\nMandatory doping tests were being severely restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. European anti-doping organizations raised concerns that blood and urine tests could not be performed and that mobilizing the staff necessary to do so before the end of the pandemic would be a health risk. Despite the need for extensive testing to take place in advance of the Games, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) stated that public health and safety were their topmost priorities.[39] The Chinese anti-doping agency temporarily ceased testing on 3 February 2020, with a planned resumption of phased testing towards the end of the month,[40] and the anti-doping organizations in the United States, France, Great Britain, and Germany had reduced their testing activities by the end of March.[39]\n\n\n\n### Postponement to 2021[edit]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (TOCOG) released a statement on 2 March 2020, confirming that preparations for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics were \"continuing as planned\".[41] On 23 March, both Canada and Australia indicated that they would withdraw from the Games if they were not postponed by a year.[42] On the same day, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe stated he would support a proposed postponement, citing that ensuring athlete safety was \"paramount,\" and veteran IOC member and former vice president Dick Pound said that he expected the Games to be postponed.[43][44]\n\n\nOn 24 March 2020, 122 days to go for the planned start, the IOC, TOCOG and prime minister Abe released a joint statement announcing that the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics would be rescheduled to a date \"beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021\". They stated that the Games could \"stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times\", and that the Olympic flame could become \"the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present\".[45] Prime Minister Abe stated that IOC president Thomas Bach responded \"with 100% agreement\" to his proposal to delay the Games. For continuity and marketing purposes, it was agreed that the Games would still be branded as Tokyo 2020 despite the change in schedule.[8]\n\n\nOn 30 March 2020, the IOC and TOCOG announced that they had reached an agreement on the new dates for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which would now begin with the opening ceremony on 23 July 2021 and end with the closing ceremony on 8 August 2021, still to be held in Tokyo.[46][47] The subsequent Winter Olympics in Beijing are scheduled to begin on 4 February 2022, less than six months later. Shortly before the postponement was confirmed, the IOC and Tokyo 2020 organizers formed a task force named \"Here We Go\" with the remit to address any issues arising from postponing the Games, such as sponsorship and accommodation. The organizers confirmed that all athletes who had already qualified for Tokyo 2020 would keep their qualification slots.[48]\n\n\n\n### Calls for cancellation[edit]\n\n\nHealth experts expressed concern in April 2020 that the Games might have to be cancelled if the pandemic should persist.[49] In an interview, the then president of TOCOG and former Japanese prime minister, Yoshirō Mori, asserted that the Games would be \"scrapped\" if they could not go ahead in 2021.[50] On 29 April 2020, Prime Minister Abe stated that the Games \"must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic\".[51] Thomas Bach acknowledged in an interview on 20 May 2020, that the job of reorganizing the Tokyo Games was \"a mammoth task\" and also admitted that the event would have to be cancelled altogether if it could not take place in the summer of 2021.[52] However, both Mori and Bach expressed optimism about the Games going ahead.[50][52]\n\n\nA member of the Japanese COVID-19 Advisory Committee on the basic action policy co-authored a *British Medical Journal* editorial, which stated, \"holding Tokyo 2020 for domestic political and economic purposes—ignoring scientific and moral imperatives—is contradictory to Japan's commitment to global health and human security\".[53]\n\n\nOn 21 January 2021, multiple sources reported that the Japanese government had \"privately concluded\" that the Games would have to be cancelled.[54] The government dismissed the claims, stating that the reports were \"categorically untrue\".[55] The new Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga confirmed on 19 February that the G7 had given unanimous support for the postponed Games to go ahead as scheduled.[56] It was reported in April 2021, just three months before the start of the Games, that there was still the option to cancel the Tokyo Olympics with the country having vaccinated less than 1% of its population, with tens of thousands of volunteers expected to take part and athletes not being required to quarantine after arriving in Japan.[57][58]\n\n\nPublic support for the Games in Japan decreased significantly amid a 2021 surge in COVID-19 cases in the country.[59] Multiple organizations of medical professionals voiced oppositions to the Games,[53][60][61] while an opinion poll in April 2021 saw 40% of participants support the cancellation of the Games, and 33% support a second postponement.[62] In May 2021, 83% of those polled supported the cancellation or postponement of the Games.[63] The Tokyo Medical Practitioners Association called for the cancellation, stating that hospitals in Tokyo \"have their hands full and have almost no spare capacity\" in an open letter to the prime minister.[64] At least nine out of 47 elected governors supported the cancellation of the Games.[65] Nearly 37% of Japanese companies surveyed supported the cancellation of the Games, and 32% supported postponement.[66]\n\n\nKenji Utsunomiya, who had previously run for Governor of Tokyo, collected more than 351,000 signatures on a petition calling for the organisers to \"prioritise life\" over the Olympics.[67] Japanese writers Jiro Akagawa[68][69] and Fuminori Nakamura also called for the Games to be postponed or cancelled.[70]\n\n\nOn 26 May 2021, the *Asahi Shimbun* newspaper, which was a local sponsor of the Games, published an editorial calling for Prime Minister Suga to \"calmly and objectively assess the situation and decide on the cancellation of the event this summer.\"[71] On 4 June it was reported that Japanese sponsors proposed to the organisers for \"the Games to be postponed for several months,\" citing a comment by a corporate sponsor senior executive: \"It just makes much, much more sense from our perspective to hold the Games when there are more vaccinated people, the weather is cooler and maybe public opposition is lower.\"[72]\n\n\nIn July 2021, it was announced that all events in Tokyo were to be held behind closed doors with no spectators due to a new state of emergency. A poll by the *Asahi Shimbun* found that 55% of those surveyed supported the cancellation of the Olympics, and 68% felt that organisers would not be able to suitably control COVID-19 at the Games.[73] The decision was also detrimental to local sponsors, which had planned in-person presences to promote their products during the Games; an executive of official sponsor Toyota stated that the company had pulled a television advertising campaign it had planned for the Games in Japan, citing that the Olympics were \"becoming an event that has not gained the public's understanding.\"[73][74]\n\n\nHad the games been cancelled, it would have been the first time since World War II that an Olympic event had been called off and the first games to be scrapped due to circumstances unrelated to war.[e] A complete cancellation would have also cost Japan ¥4.52 trillion (US$41.5 billion), based on operating expenses and loss of tourism activity due to Japan which had closed its international borders to foreign travellers since March 2020, did not eventually reopen until October 2022, and was initially scheduled to end preventive border measures in May 2023 but had moved early at the end of April of that year, less than two years after the Games ended.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Costs and insurance[edit]\n\n\nAccording to an estimate conducted by professor emeritus Katsuhiro Miyamoto of Kansai University and reported by the NHK in March 2020, the cost of delaying the 2020 Olympics by one year would be 640.8 billion yen (US$5.8 billion), taking maintenance expenditures for the unused facilities into account.[75]\n\n\nThe Nomura Research Institute estimated that cancelling the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2021 would cost around 1.81 trillion yen ($17 billion), less than the economic damages projected if another state of emergency is declared, noting that a decision to hold the games \"should be made based on the impact on infection risks, not from the standpoint of economic loss\".[77]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Games were protected through the commercial insurance marketplace Lloyd's of London, by global reinsurers Munich Re and Swiss Re. The IOC takes out around $800 million of insurance for each Summer Olympics, with the total amount of loss insured for the 2020 Games likely to be more than $2 billion.[*needs update*] The disruption caused by postponing the Games was covered by the insurance policy, with those likely to make claims for their financial losses including local organizers, sponsors, hospitality firms, and travel providers.[78][79][*needs update*]\n\n\nHolders of tickets purchased from overseas prior to postponement were entitled to refunds for both Olympic and Paralympic ticket purchases, except for the costs of cancelled hotel bookings. Although about 600,000 Olympic tickets and 300,000 Paralympic tickets were eligible to be refunded, organizers said that they would not release the total costs of the refunds.[80] Reuters quoted industry sources who estimated that the Tokyo Olympics Committee had taken out US$500–800 million in insurance, and that after accounting for costs such as rebooking sporting venues and the Olympic Village, little of that payout would be available to recoup the proceeds of lost and refunded ticket sales.[81] The local organizers are responsible for ticket sales and use them to defray the costs of holding the games; ticket sales were expected to bring in approximately US$800 million, but actual sales were close to zero.[82]\n\n\nIn June 2022, the Tokyo Organizing Committee revealed in the final budget report for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics that the cost for the Olympic Games was 640.4 billion yen (US$5.8 billion [f]), which was higher than the cost for the Rio 2016.[84][2]\n\n\n\n### Public opinion and COVID-19 effect during and after the Games[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the Tokyo Olympics being held, many Japanese people were negative about hosting the event, but their attitudes had become more positive towards the end of the Games. According to a public opinion poll conducted jointly by the Nippon News Network and the *Yomiuri Shimbun* newspaper, which targeted Japanese citizens at the end of the Olympics, 38% of respondents said that it was possible to hold the Olympics in a safe manner against COVID-19, while 55% said that it was not possible. However, 64% answered that it was good that the Tokyo Games had gone ahead, while 28% answered that they wished the event had not been held. Of the respondents, 61% were glad the event had been held without spectators and only 12% said that spectators should have been allowed.[85]\n\n\nOn 29 July, less than a week into the Games, journalist Masaki Kubota reported his analysis of the Japanese people's perspective on the Olympics, which he believed was greatly influenced by the change in the way the Japanese news media reported on the Games. He pointed out that many Japanese news media had insisted on canceling the Olympics, citing fears that COVID-19 would spread, but once Japanese athletes started winning medals, the media changed their reporting policy and began livening up the Olympics, which had the effect of altering public opinion in Japan.[86]\n\n\nOnce the Tokyo Olympics were underway, followed by the Tokyo Paralympics, there was a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in Japan, especially those caused by the Delta variant. On 26 July, there were 60,157 cases detected in Japan, breaking the record of 44,961 cases recorded on 10 May. On 9 August, one day after the Olympics had ended, daily cases in Japan reached 100,000 for the first time, and new cases continued to increase until the peak on 23 August, when 156,931 cases were recorded.[87]\n\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games\n\n![](image)The Olympic rings on display at Tokyo Bay to promote the Games\nThe Tokyo Organizing Committee was originally headed by former Japanese prime minister Yoshirō Mori,[88] but he resigned in February 2021 due to backlash from sexist comments about women in meetings.[89][90][91] Seiko Hashimoto was chosen to succeed him. Tamayo Marukawa, Minister for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, was responsible for overseeing the preparations on behalf of the Japanese government.[91]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Metropolitan Government set aside a fund of ¥400 billion (more than US$3.67 billion) to cover the cost of hosting the Games. The Japanese government was considering easing airspace restrictions to allow an increased slot capacity at both Haneda and Narita airports. A new railway line was planned to link both airports through an expansion of Tokyo Station, cutting travel time from Tokyo Station to Haneda from 30 minutes to 18 minutes, and from Tokyo Station to Narita from 55 minutes to 36 minutes; funded primarily by private investors, the line would cost ¥400 billion. The East Japan Railway Company (JR East) was also planning a new route near Tamachi to Haneda Airport.[92]\n\n\nThere were plans to fund the accelerated completion of the Central Circular Route, Tokyo Gaikan Expressway, and Ken-Ō Expressway, and the refurbishment of other major expressways in the area.[93] The Yurikamome automated transit line was also to be extended from its existing terminal at Toyosu Station to a new terminal at Kachidoki Station, passing the site of the Olympic Village, although the line was not expected to have adequate capacity to serve major events in the Odaiba area on its own.[94]\n\n\nIn April 2018, the Tokyo Organizing Committee signed a partnership with the International Labour Organization to ensure decent work in the preparation of and during the 2020 Olympic Games.[95]\n\n\nIn June 2020, the chief executive of the Organizing Committee, Toshirō Mutō, stated that the committee was exploring options for streamlining the Games to achieve cost savings.[96] On 25 September, the IOC and Tokyo Organizing Committee agreed to a suite of measures to simplify the Games' logistics, including a cut to non-athlete staff, use of online meetings, and streamlined transport, among others. The committee also outlined areas it would be exploring in order to maintain the health and safety of all participants.[97]\n\n\n\n### Venues and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The newly built Japan National Stadium in Tokyo was the venue for the ceremonies and the athletics events.\nMain article: Venues of the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Tokyo's former National Stadium, the central venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, would undergo a ¥100 billion renovation for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics.[98] In November 2012, the Japan Sport Council announced that it was taking bids for proposed stadium designs. Of the 46 finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid design—which was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrine—and widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and \"optimize\" the design.[99]\n\n\nIn June 2015, the government announced plans to reduce the new stadium's permanent capacity to 65,000 in its athletics configuration (although with the option to add up to 15,000 temporary seats for football) as a further cost-saving measure.[100][101] The original plan to build a retractable roof was also abandoned.[102] At the end of 2015, as a result of public opposition to the increasing costs of the new stadium (which had reached ¥252 billion), the government chose to reject Zaha Hadid's design entirely and selected a new design by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. Inspired by traditional temples and with a lower profile, Kuma's design had a budget of ¥149 billion. The changes meant the new stadium could not be completed in time for the 2019 Rugby World Cup as originally intended.[103] The National Stadium, which was inaugurated on 21 December 2019, was named the Olympic Stadium for the duration of the Tokyo Games.[104]\n\n\nIn October 2018, the Board of Audit issued a report stating that the total cost of the Olympic venues could exceed US$25 billion.[105]\n\n\nOf the 33 competition venues in Tokyo, 28 were within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of the Olympic Village, with eleven new venues to be constructed.[106] On 16 October 2019, the IOC announced that there were plans to re-locate the marathon and racewalking events to Sapporo for heat concerns.[107] The plans were made official on 1 November 2019 after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike accepted the IOC's decision, despite her belief that the events should have remained in Tokyo.[108]\n\n\nIn general, as urban studies scholar Faure notes, \"The Tokyo 2020–2021 Games had a relatively moderate impact on the city, compared to previous cases such as Rio and Sochi, or cases in which a major Olympic park was built in Barcelona in 1992, and in Beijing in 2008. The transport infrastructure has been marginally improved by facilitating access for people with mobility constraints and improving signage in other languages. Haneda Airport has been expanded, and a hydrogen-powered bus rapid transit system has been introduced. Several sports and event facilities were built, including the new Olympic Stadium. Finally, the Olympic Village has been built on the Harumi landfill.\"[109]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Police patrolling and watching from a rooftop near the tennis venue\nIn December 2018, the Japanese government chose to ban drones from flying over venues being used for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. A similar ban was also imposed for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which Japan also hosted.[110] In January 2020, counterterrorism drills began in different parts where the Games would take place, after intelligence data showed that terrorist groups could have carried out an attack seeking worldwide attention.[111] In July 2021, prior to the start of the Games, the Japan Coast Guard conducted counterterrorism drills in the Tokyo Bay. The drill consisted of two inflatable boats trying to stop a suspicious ship from getting to shore.[112]\n\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nApplications for volunteering at the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games were accepted beginning on 26 September 2018. By 18 January 2019, a total of 204,680 applications had been received by the Tokyo Organizing Committee.[113] Interviews to select the requisite number of volunteers began in February 2019, with training scheduled to take place in October 2019.[114] The volunteers at the venues were to be known as \"Field Cast\", and the volunteers in the city were to be known as \"City Cast\". These names were chosen from a shortlist of four from an original 150 pairs of names; the other three shortlisted names were \"Shining Blue\" and \"Shining Blue Tokyo\", \"Games Anchor\" and \"City Anchor\", and \"Games Force\" and \"City Force\". The names were chosen by the people who had applied to be volunteers at the Games.[115]\n\n\nAs of early June 2021, approximately 10,000 out of the 80,000 registered volunteers resigned from the Games. Media attributed the rise in pandemic cases as the reason for massive quitting.[116] More volunteer assignments were expected to be cancelled due to the spectator ban.[117]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Olympic medal\n\n![](image)Due to COVID-19 protocols, the medals were presented to the athletes on a tray and each athlete was asked to put on their own medal, rather than have it placed around their neck by a dignitary.[118]\nIn February 2017, the Tokyo Organizing Committee announced an electronics recycling program in partnership with Japan Environmental Sanitation Center and NTT Docomo, soliciting donations of electronics such as mobile phones to be reclaimed as materials for the medals. Aiming to collect eight tonnes of metals to produce the medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, collection boxes were deployed at public locations and NTT Docomo retail shops in April 2017.[119][120] A design competition for the medals was launched in December of that year.[121]\n\n\nIn May 2018, the organizing committee reported that they had obtained half the required 2,700 kilograms of bronze but were struggling to obtain the required amount of silver; although bronze and silver medals purely utilize their respective materials, IOC requirements mandate that gold medals utilize silver as a base.[122] The collection of bronze was completed in November 2018, with the remainder estimated to have been completed by March 2019.[123]\n\n\nOn 24 July 2019 (one year ahead of the originally scheduled opening ceremony), the designs of the medals were unveiled.[124][125] The medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games were designed by Junichi Kawanishi following a nationwide competition.[126] A new feature shared with the Paralympic medals is that the ribbons contain one, two, or three silicone convex lines to distinguish gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively.[125]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\nThe slogan of the 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay was \"Hope Lights Our Way\".[127][128]\n\n\nAs determined by a 2009 IOC ruling that banned international torch relays for any future Olympic Games,[129] the 2020 Summer Olympics torch was scheduled to only visit the two countries of Greece and the host nation Japan. The first phase of the relay began on 12 March 2020, with the traditional flame lighting ceremony at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The torch then travelled to Athens, where the Greek leg of the relay culminated in a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium on 19 March, during which the torch was transferred to the Japanese contingent.[127] The flame was placed inside a special lantern and transported from Athens International Airport on a chartered flight to Higashimatsushima in Japan. The torch was then expected to begin the second phase of its journey on 20 March, as it traveled for one week around the three most affected areas of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami—Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima—where it would go on display under the heading \"Flame of Recovery\". After leaving Naraha on 26 March, the torch would commence its main relay around Japan, incorporating all 47 prefectural capitals.[128]\n\n\nAfter the decision to postpone the Games was made, the torch was placed again in a special lantern on display in the city of Fukushima for a month. After that, the lantern was transferred to the Tokyo prefecture, where it was kept safe until the restart of the relay in 2021.[130] On 23 July 2020 (one year ahead of the rescheduled opening ceremony), a promotional video was released featuring Japanese swimmer Rikako Ikee carrying the lantern inside Japan National Stadium, drawing comparisons between emergence from the pandemic and her own return to sport after being diagnosed with leukemia.[131] On 20 August 2020, it was announced that the torch relay would begin again in Naraha, Fukushima on 25 March 2021, nearly a year later than originally planned.[130][132]\n\n\nThe final course of the relay was altered due to concerns regarding public health concerns about gatherings along the route (e.g., the Miyakojima leg was canceled), and the relay was held without spectators due to states of emergency in some regions (e.g., Matsuyama, Hiroshima, Hyōgo, and Okayama).[133] The relay ended at Tokyo's National Stadium (Olympic Stadium) on 23 July, with tennis player Naomi Osaka lighting the Olympic cauldron at the finale of the opening ceremony.[134] The cauldron lit in the Olympic Stadium was only used during the Opening and Closing ceremonies: a separate cauldron was lit on the Tokyo waterfront for public view at the Yume No Ohashi Bridge in Odaiba, making it only the second time in olympic history where the cauldron was not displayed in the athletics stadium, the other time being in 2016.[135]\n\n\n\n### Biosecurity protocols[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Temperature check and COVID-19 countermeasures at the tennis venue\nIn February 2021, the IOC began releasing \"playbooks\" containing details on planned COVID-19 biosecurity protocols for athletes, officials, the press, and other staff, including standard protocols such as practicing social distancing, hygiene, the wearing of face masks (outside of training and competition for athletes), and being restricted from visiting bars, restaurants, shops, and other tourist areas around Greater Tokyo Area, or using public transport unless otherwise permitted. Participants would be asked to use Japan's COCOA Exposure Notification app and would be tested at least every four days. Athletes who tested positive would be unable to compete and could be quarantined at a government facility (although leeway would be given in the event of false positives). Close contacts would also need to test negative in order to be cleared for competition. Athletes would be discouraged from \"excessive\" celebrations because the actions could spread infected droplets.[136][137][138] The playbooks were criticized in a paper published by *The New England Journal of Medicine* in May 2021, for lacking \"scientifically rigorous risk assessment\" and failing to \"distinguish the various levels of risk faced by athletes\". The playbook stated that the athletes were required to arrive up to five days prior to the start of the competition and to leave within 48 hours of being eliminated from their sport or the conclusion of the competitions.[139][140]\n\n\nThe IOC recommended the vaccination of athletes against COVID-19 if vaccines were available to them, but this was not a prerequisite for participation and the IOC advised against athletes \"jumping the queue\" in order to obtain priority over essential populations.[141] On 12 March 2021, Thomas Bach announced that in nations where they were approved for use, the Chinese Olympic Committee had offered to cover the costs of the Chinese CoronaVac and the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine for athletes competing in the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics, and would purchase two doses for their nation's general public for each vaccinated athlete.[142] On 6 May 2021, Pfizer announced that it would donate doses of its vaccine to NOCs competing in Tokyo.[143]\n\n\nApproximately 93,000 athletes and officials were exempt from the quarantine rules upon arriving in Japan, provided that they remained in areas separated from the local population. With around 300,000 local staff and volunteers entering and exiting these bubbles, and 20,000 vaccine doses allocated for this group, this led to concerns of COVID-19 spreading both during the Games and when teams returned to their countries.[144][145]\n\n\nDue to international travel restrictions, the organizing committee announced in March 2021 that no international guests (including spectators, and friends and family members of the athletes) would be allowed to attend the Games. As per existing guidance for spectator sports in Japan, spectators would be asked to refrain from cheering or shouting.[138] On 19 June 2021, Governor Koike announced that plans for public viewing events for the Games had been scrapped, in order to use the planned venues (such as Yoyogi Park) as mass vaccination sites instead.[146] On 21 June, it was announced that all venues would be capped at a maximum of 10,000 ticketed spectators or 50% capacity, whichever was lower.[147]\n\n\nOn 2 July 2021, the new TOCOG president Seiko Hashimoto warned that there was still a possibility of the Games being held behind closed doors because of rising COVID-19 cases in the country.[148][149] Japan's slow vaccination rate had been of particular concern.[150][151] A simulation run by the University of Tokyo in May 2021 projected that a new wave of infections could peak in mid-October if the Games went on after the existing state of emergency in Tokyo had expired.[152][153]\n\n\nOn 8 July 2021, after Tokyo had recorded 920 new COVID-19 cases (its highest increase since May), Prime Minister Suga declared a new state of emergency in the Tokyo area from 12 July through 22 August (ending only two days before the Paralympics' opening ceremony), and announced that all events at venues in the area would therefore be held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted. Hashimoto stated that \"it is extremely regrettable that the Games will be staged in a very limited manner in the face of the spread of novel coronavirus infections.\" IOC President Thomas Bach stated that \"we will support any measure which is necessary to have a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games for the Japanese people and all the participants.\"[150][151][154]\n\n\nThe announcement stated that spectators would still be allowed at events being held outside of Tokyo, subject to the approval by local health authorities and the aforementioned 50%/10,000-spectator limit. The prefectures of Fukushima, Hokkaido and Ibaraki announced that they would prohibit spectators at events held in the areas.[155] The opening ceremony was expected to be limited to fewer than 1,000 VIP guests, including IOC representatives and dignitaries,[156] while some events did allow members of other competing delegations to occupy spectator seats as well.[157] School students were invited to watch football matches in Ibaraki.[158][159]\n\n\nOn 16 July, it was reported that Bach had asked Prime Minister Suga about the possibility that restrictions on spectators could be eased later on if COVID-19 conditions were to improve in Tokyo.[156] However, on 2 August, Suga announced that all existing state of emergency declarations would be extended through 31 August, and be extended to Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama, and parts of Osaka.[160]\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nThe opening ceremony tickets were expected to range from ¥12,000 to ¥300,000, with a maximum price of ¥130,000 for the finals of the athletics track and field events.[161] The average ticket price was ¥7,700, with half the tickets being sold for up to ¥8,000. A symbolic ticket price of ¥2,020 was expected for families, groups resident in Japan, and in conjunction with a school program.[161] Tickets would be sold through 40,000 shops in Japan and by mail order to Japanese addresses through the internet.[162] International guests, had they been allowed, would have needed to visit Japan during the sales period, or arrange to buy tickets through a third party such as a travel agent.[163]\n\n\nTickets went on general sale in Japan in the autumn of 2019 and were expected to be sold globally from June 2020; however, this plan was suspended when the Games were postponed on 24 March 2020. The Tokyo Organizing Committee confirmed that tickets already purchased would remain valid for the same sessions according to the new schedule and that refunds were also being offered.[164]\n\n\nOn 20 March 2021, it was announced that due to COVID-19-related concerns, no international guests would be allowed to attend the 2020 Olympics or Paralympics. This included both spectators, as well as the friends and family of athletes. All overseas ticketholders would be refunded.[138] Hashimoto cited uncertainties surrounding international travel restrictions, and goals to preserve the safety of all participants and spectators, and not place a burden on the health care system.[138] It was ultimately announced in July that all local spectators were not allowed to attend any events held in Tokyo, Fukushima and Hokkaido.[150][151][154]\n\n\n\n### Cultural festival[edit]\n\n\nA cultural program known as Nippon Festival was scheduled to coincide with the Olympics and Paralympics, running from April to September 2021 as a series of streaming events held by the Tokyo Organizing Committee and other partners. The events reflected the themes of \"Participation and Interaction\", \"Towards the Realisation of an Inclusive Society\" and \"Reconstruction of the Tohoku Region\". The program was either downsized or reformatted to virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the postponement of the Games.[165] One of these events was a concert held on 18 July, which featured J-rock band Wanima, choreography by dancers Aio Yamada and Tuki Takamura, and the presentation of animated \"creatures\" based on illustrations \"embodying the thoughts and emotions of people from across the world\".[166]\n\n\nThe original plans for Nippon Festival included events such as *Kabuki x Opera* (a concert that would have featured stage actor Ichikawa Ebizō XI, opera singers Anna Pirozzi and Erwin Schrott, and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra), an arts and culture festival focusing on disabilities,[167][168][169][170] and a special two-day exhibition sumo tournament at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan shortly after the Olympics—which would have differed significantly from the traditional bi-monthly *Honbasho* tournaments, and featured special commentary in English and Japanese to help explain to spectators the customs and traditions of professional sumo, which are deeply rooted in the Shinto religion.[171][172]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A scene from the Opening Ceremony at the Olympic Stadium, with drones flying around and creating the official logo of the Games\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n\nThe opening ceremony was held on 23 July 2021 in the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo. It included the traditional Parade of Nations. Emperor Naruhito formally opened the Games, and at the end of the torch relay the Olympic cauldron was lit by Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka.[173]\n\n\nFor the first time in the 2020 Olympic Games, it was decided that one male and one female in each country would take turns holding flags and serve as two of them.[174] \nThis was done by embodying the \"Agenda 2020\" set during President Bach's term.[175][176]\n\n\nFor the first time in the history of the games, a moment of silence was observed in the opening ceremony for the victims of COVID-19, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami and the Munich massacre.[177]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Olympic sports\n\n![](image)Nippon Budokan\n![](image)Ariake Arena\n![](image)Ariake Gymnastics Centre\n![](image)Tokyo Aquatics Centre\n![](image)Yoyogi Gymnasium\n![](image)Saitama Super Arena\n![](image)Ryogoku Kokugikan\n![](image)Enoshima Yacht Harbor, Kanagawa\n![](image)Tsurigasaki Beach, Chiba\nThe event program for the 2020 Summer Olympics was approved by the IOC executive board on 9 June 2017. IOC president Thomas Bach stated that their goal was to give the Games \"youthful\" and \"urban\" appeal, and to increase the number of female participants.[178][179]\n\n\nThe Games featured 339 events in 33 different sports, encompassing a total of 50 disciplines. Karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding made their Olympic debut, while baseball and softball also made a one-off return to the Summer Olympics for the first time since 2008. 15 new events within existing sports were also added, including 3×3 basketball, freestyle BMX, and the return of madison cycling, as well as 9 new mixed events in several sports (table tennis, archery, judo, shooting (3), triathlon, 4 × 400 m relay running and 4 × 100 m medley swimming).[180]\n\n\nIn the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.[180]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2020 Summer Olympic Sports program\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aquatics\n\t+ ![](image) Artistic swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Diving (8)\n\t+ ![](image) Marathon swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Swimming (35)\n\t+ ![](image) Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (5)\n* ![](image) Athletics (48)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* Baseball\n\t+ ![](image) Baseball (1)\n\t+ ![](image) Softball (1)\n* ![](image) Basketball\n\t+ Basketball (2)\n\t+ 3×3 basketball (2)\n | * ![](image) Boxing (13)\n* ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n* ![](image) Cycling\n\t+ BMX freestyle (2)\n\t+ BMX racing (2)\n\t+ Mountain biking (2)\n\t+ Road cycling (4)\n\t+ Track cycling (12)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n* ![](image) Fencing (12)\n* ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n | * ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Golf (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (15)\n* ![](image) Karate\n\t+ Kata (2)\n\t+ Kumite (6)\n* ![](image) Modern pentathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Rowing (14)\n* ![](image) Rugby sevens (2)\n* ![](image) Sailing (10)\n | * ![](image) Shooting (15)\n* ![](image) Skateboarding (4)\n* ![](image) Sport climbing (2)\n* ![](image) Surfing (2)\n* ![](image) Table tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Taekwondo (8)\n* ![](image) Tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (3)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (14)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (12)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (6)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n#### New sports[edit]\n\n\nOn 12 February 2013, with a remit to control the cost of the Games and ensure they are \"relevant to sports fans of all generations\", the IOC Executive Board recommended the removal of one of the 26 sports contested at the 2012 Summer Olympics, leaving a vacancy which the IOC would seek to fill at the 125th IOC Session. The new entrant would join golf and rugby sevens (which would both debut in 2016) as part of the program of 28 \"core\" sports. Five sports were shortlisted for removal, including canoe, field hockey, modern pentathlon, taekwondo, and wrestling. In the final round of voting by the executive board, eight members voted to remove wrestling from the Olympic program. Hockey and taekwondo were both tied in second with three votes each.[181][182][183]\n\n\nThe decision to drop wrestling surprised many media outlets, given that the sport's role in the Olympics dates back to the ancient Olympic Games, and was included in the original program for the modern Games. *The New York Times* felt that the decision was based on the shortage of well-known talent and the absence of women's events in the sport.[184][185][186] Out of the shortlist from the IOC vote, Wrestling was duly added to the shortlist of applicants for inclusion in the 2020 Games, alongside the seven new sports that were put forward for consideration.[184]\n\n\nOn 29 May 2013, it was announced that three of the eight sports under consideration had made the final shortlist: baseball/softball, squash and wrestling.[187] The other five sports were rejected at this point: karate, roller sports, sport climbing, wakeboarding, and wushu.[188] At the 125th IOC Session on 8 September 2013, wrestling was chosen to be included in the Olympic program for 2020 and 2024. Wrestling secured 49 votes, while baseball/softball and squash received 24 votes and 22 votes respectively.[189]\n\n\nWith the adoption of the *Olympic Agenda 2020* in December 2014, the IOC shifted from a \"sport-based\" approach to the Olympic program to an \"event-based\" program—establishing that organizing committees may propose discretionary events to be included in the program to improve local interest.[190][191] As a result of these changes, a shortlist of eight new proposed sports was unveiled on 22 June 2015, consisting of baseball/softball, bowling, karate, roller sports, sport climbing, squash, surfing, and wushu.[192] On 28 September 2015, the Tokyo Organizing Committee submitted their shortlist of five proposed sports to the IOC: baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding.[193] These five new sports were approved on 3 August 2016 by the IOC during the 129th IOC Session in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and were included in the sports program for 2020 only, bringing the total number of sports at the 2020 Olympics to 33.[194][195]\n\n\n\n### Test events[edit]\n\n\nA total of 56 test events were scheduled to take place in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. Two of the events were held in late 2018, but the main test event schedule commenced in June 2019 and was originally due to be completed in May 2020 prior to the start of the Olympics. Several of the events were incorporated into pre-existing championships, but some have been newly created specifically to serve as Olympic test events for the 2020 Summer Games.[196][197]\n\n\nIn February 2019, it was announced that the test events would be branded under the banner \"Ready, Steady, Tokyo\". The Tokyo Organizing Committee is responsible for 22 of the test events, with the remaining events being arranged by national and international sports federations. The first test event was World Sailing's World Cup Series, held at Enoshima in September 2018. The last scheduled event is the Tokyo Challenge Track Meet, which was originally due to take place at the Olympic Stadium on 6 May 2020.[198]\n\n\nAll test events originally scheduled to take place from 12 March 2020 onwards were postponed due to COVID-19, with the test event calendar to be reviewed during the preparations for the rescheduled Games.[g][199]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia has competed under the provisional name \"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\" in every Summer and Winter Games since its debut in 1996 because of the disputed status of its official name. The naming disputes with Greece ended in 2018 with the signing of the Prespa agreement, and the country was officially renamed North Macedonia in February 2019. The new name was immediately recognized by the IOC, although the Olympic Committee of North Macedonia (NMOC) was not officially adopted until February 2020. The NMOC sent a delegation to the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics in January 2020, but the Tokyo Games were North Macedonia's first appearance at the Summer Olympics under its new name.[200]\n\n\nSince competing as Swaziland ten times at the Summer and Winter Olympics, Eswatini made its debut under that name after the renaming of the country by the king in 2018.[201]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with laboratory data that it had provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA planned to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they would be excluded from team sports. The head of WADA's Compliance Review Committee, Jonathan Taylor, stated that the IOC would not be able to use the \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) designation as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes could not be portrayed as representing a specific country.[202][203][204] Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against WADA's decision.[205] After reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 that the penalty placed on Russia be reduced. Instead of a total ban from all sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but the team would not be permitted to use the Russian name, flag, or anthem for a period of two years and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for \"Russia\" to be displayed on the team uniform—although it should be no more visible than the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation—as well as the use of the Russian flag's colors within the uniform's design.[206]\n\n\nOn 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym \"ROC\" after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee although the name of the committee itself in full could not be used to refer to the delegation. The ROC team would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee.[207]\n\n\n\nOn 6 April 2021, North Korea announced that it would not participate in the 2020 Summer Olympics because of COVID-19 concerns.[208] This marked North Korea's first absence from the Summer Olympics since 1988.[209] In September, a month after the games concluded, the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was banned from participation in the 2022 Winter Olympics, after they failed to participate in the Tokyo Olympics. On 21 July 2021, Guinea announced it would not be sending a delegation to the Tokyo Olympics, allegedly due to COVID-19 concerns, though media outlets suggested that financial considerations may have been the real motivating factor.[210] Guinea later reversed the decision and confirmed that it would be participating.[211]\n\n\n\n![](image)Participating nations\n![](image)Country by team size\nThe following 206 teams qualified (including the 104 universality places guaranteed in athletics, under which all 206 NOCs may send competitors regardless of qualification).[212]\n\n\n\n\n\n|

of the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nThe 2020 schedule by session was approved by the IOC Executive Board on 18 July 2018, with the exception of swimming, diving, and artistic swimming. A more detailed schedule by event was released on 16 April 2019, still omitting a detailed schedule for the boxing events.[214][215] A detailed boxing schedule was released in late 2019.[216]\n\n\nThe original schedule was from 22 July to 9 August 2020. To postpone the Olympics until 2021, all events were delayed by 364 days (one day less than a full year to preserve the same days of the week), giving a new schedule of 21 July to 8 August 2021.[217]\n\n\n\n*All times and dates use Japan Standard Time (UTC+9)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **OC** | Opening ceremony\n | ● | Event

|\n\n\n### Medal ceremonies[edit]\n\n\nNaoki Satō composed the music for the medal ceremonies. Satō chose not to employ any musical elements distinctive to Japan \"because victory ceremonies are for athletes from around the world\" and he wanted all medalists to \"feel at ease\" when taking their places on the podium, regardless of their nationality.[221]\n\n\nThe bouquets presented to the athletes came from regions affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The individual flowers were selected to represent the prefectures of Miyagi, Fukushima, Iwate, and Tokyo. The sunflowers were grown in Miyagi, planted by families whose children had died during the disaster; the white and purple eustomas and Solomon's seals were provided by a non-profit initiative to boost the local economy in Fukushima; the small bright blue gentians were grown in Iwate; and aspidistras, grown in Tokyo, were chosen to complete the bouquets.[222]\n\n\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\nPer the historical precedent of swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, swimming finals were held in the morning to allow live primetime broadcasts in the Americas. NBC paid substantial fees for rights to the Olympics, so the IOC has allowed NBC to influence event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible. On 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through the 2032 games,[223] with the company being one of the IOC's major sources of revenue.[224] Japanese broadcasters were said to have criticized the decision, as swimming is one of the most popular Olympic events in the country.[225][226]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n![](image)Miraitowa (left), the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics, and Someity (right), the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Paralympics\nThe official emblems for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 25 April 2016; designed by Asao Tokolo, who won a nationwide design contest, it takes the form of a ring in an indigo-colored checkerboard pattern. The design was meant to \"express a refined elegance and sophistication that exemplifies Japan\".[227] The checkered design resembles a pattern called *ichimatsu moyo* that was popular during the Edo period in Japan from 1603 to 1867.[228] The designs replaced a previous emblem which had been scrapped after allegations that it plagiarized the logo of the Théâtre de Liège in Belgium. The Games' bid slogan was *Discover Tomorrow* (Japanese: 未来（あした）をつかもう, romanized: *Ashita o tsukamō*). While *ashita* literally means \"tomorrow\", it is intentionally spelled as *mirai*, \"future\".[229] The official slogan *United by Emotion* was unveiled on 17 February 2020. The slogan was used solely in English.[230]\n\n\nThe official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics was Miraitowa, a figure with blue-checkered *ichimatsu moyo* patterns inspired by the Games' official emblem. Its fictional characteristics include the ability to teleport.[231] Created by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, the mascots were selected from a competition process which took place in late 2017 and early 2018. A total of 2,042 candidate designs were submitted to the Tokyo Organizing Committee, which selected three pairs of unnamed mascot designs to present to Japanese elementary school students for the final decision.[232][233] The results of the selection were announced on 28 February 2018, and the mascots were named on 22 July 2018. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words for \"future\" and \"eternity\",[231] and Someity is named after *someiyoshino*, a type of cherry blossom.[234] Someity's name also refers to the English phrase \"so mighty\".[235] The mascots were expected to help finance the Tokyo Games through merchandizing and licensing deals.[236] For the legacy of the games on 3 January 2022, Ryo Taniguchi created Miraity (the future child of the mascots).[237]\n\n\n\n### Look of the Games[edit]\n\n\nAlongside the main *Emblem blue*, the five other colors used in the branding of the 2020 Games were : \n  *Kurenai red*,   *Ai blue*,   *Sakura pink*,   *Fuji purple*, and   *Matsuba green*. These five traditional colors of Japan were used as sub-colors to create points of difference in the color variations.[238]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nSee also: Belarus 2020 Summer Olympics scandal\n\nSeveral controversial issues occurred during the preparations for the Tokyo Games. There were allegations of bribery in the Japanese Olympic Committee's (JOC) bid and of plagiarism in the initial design for the Games' logo. On 10 December 2018, the French financial crimes office began an investigation of Tsunekazu Takeda, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, concerning a 2013 scheme to obtain votes from African IOC members in support of Tokyo as host for the 2020 Olympics over Istanbul or Madrid.[239][240] In March 2020, a Japanese businessman admitted to giving gifts, including cameras and watches, to IOC officials in order to lobby for their support of Tokyo's bid to host the Olympic Games.[241] The official emblems of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, designed by Kenjirō Sano [ja], were unveiled in July 2015 but were withdrawn and replaced following plagiarism accusations.[242][243] The lawsuit by Olivier Debie, who claimed that his logo design was copied, was later dropped, with the designer citing escalating legal costs.[244]\n\n\nMass logging for construction of the Olympic venues received international criticism. Petitions, containing more than 140,000 signatures in total, were delivered to the Japanese embassies in Switzerland and Germany, expressing concerns over claims of using tropical wood sourced from Shin Yang, a Malaysian company with a record of human rights abuses, illegal logging, and rainforest destruction.[245][246] In February 2018, the Olympics Organizing Committee admitted that 87% of plywood panels used to build the new national stadium was sourced from endangered rainforests.[247]\n\n\nPortions of the Games were scheduled for locations impacted by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The hosting of events in these locations was promoted as a means of furthering recovery in the regions, with the Games sometimes being promoted as the \"Recovery Olympics\".[248][249]\n\n\nHowever, the organization of events in these regions has faced criticism; Fukushima is considered safe by the World Health Organization and the United Nations, although scientific studies on the safety of the area are still disputed.[250] Some Tōhoku residents questioned the decision to use the region as a host site, arguing that preparations for the Games slowed down recovery efforts, and that the region lost workers to projects associated with the Games.[251]\n\n\nIt was widely reported by international media that South Korea had asked the IOC to ban the Japanese Rising Sun Flag from the 2020 Summer Olympics,[252] claiming it to be a symbol of Japan's imperialist past, recalling \"historic scars and pain\" for people of Korea just as the swastika \"reminds Europeans of the nightmare of World War II\".[253][254] Use of the flag in international sporting events such as the Olympic Games is controversial because it was used for waging aggressive war against many countries in Pacific regions, including the Attack on Pearl Harbor.[255] According to the Associated Press, the IOC issued a statement in response to South Korea's request, saying, \"sports stadiums should be free of any political demonstration. When concerns arise at games time we look at them on a case-by-case basis.\"[256] Russian and South Korean officials took issue with a map of the torch relay on the Games' official website, which depicted the disputed Liancourt Rocks (governed by South Korea) and Kuril Islands (governed by Russia since 1945) as part of Japan.[257]\n\n\nIn February 2021, the TOCOG president Yoshirō Mori resigned, after facing both domestic and international criticisms over his sexist remarks.[258][259] The previous conduct of the new president, Seiko Hashimoto, has also drawn criticisms,[260] leading her to comment \"I regret it and think I should be careful\" on one of the accusations.[261] The head creative director for the opening and closing ceremonies, Hiroshi Sasaki [ja], resigned in March 2021, after making demeaning comments about Naomi Watanabe.[262][263] Sasaki's replacement, Kentarō Kobayashi, was dismissed by the Organizing Committee the day before the opening ceremony,[264][265] after it was reported by Japanese media that he had made a joke about the Holocaust in a script for his comedy in 1998, saying \"Let's play Holocaust.\"[266] On the eve of the opening ceremony, Yoshihide Suga, the Prime Minister of Japan and the Supreme Advisor of the Organizing Committee,[267] described Kobayashi's jokes as \"outrageous and unacceptable\", but also said that the opening ceremony, which was directed by Kobayashi, should proceed as planned.[268]\n\n\nThe composer for the opening ceremony, Keigo Oyamada, resigned days before the ceremony after growing criticism of his past bullying of people with apparent disabilities, such as Down syndrome.[269][270] On 16 July, a week before the opening ceremony, TOCOG announced their support of Oyamada as a composer and vowed not to change his selection for the ceremonies,[271][272] but growing criticism forced him to announce his resignation on 19 July.[273][274] The opening ceremony music included arrangements of video game soundtracks originating in Japan; however, this included music from the *Dragon Quest* series, composed by Koichi Sugiyama whom *The Daily Beast* described as \"notoriously homophobic and ultranationalist\", leading to further criticism of the Organizing Committee.[275]\n\n\nOfficials reported that by early June 2021, about 10,000 of the 80,000 registered volunteers had quit.[276] \"There's no doubt that one of the reasons is concern over coronavirus infections,\" the chief executive of the Organizing Committee said,[277] also stating he did not believe this would impact the operation of the Games.[276] On 23 July, hundreds of anti-Olympic protestors gathered outside the Japan National Stadium before the opening ceremony. Security guards blocked reporters from leaving the stadium to interview protestors.[278] In total, more than 60,000 police were mobilized for security during the Games, and police were regularly deployed to break up public displays of protest, including tackling protestors on their way to join the anti-Olympic protest in Sendagaya during the closing ceremony on September 5, 2021. This overwhelming police presence, including plainclothes police officers who encircled the protest area, \"served as an effective tool to criminalize a peaceful rally and to maintain a frightening image of open protest.\"[279]\n\n\nWriting for *The Conversation*, Olympic scholar MacIntosh Ross raised concerns about the relationship between the IOC and WHO, suggesting the organizations showed a lack of concern for the health of Japanese citizens and Olympians. As Ross explained, \"when the IOC and WHO support a global mega-event held during a pandemic, it's difficult to believe that the well-being of the host nation remains a priority.\"[280] Similarly, Japan scholars O'Shea and Maslow remark, \"International media coverage and commentary runs the gamut from sometimes scathing critique for attempting to pull off a 'pandemic games', to praise and plaudits for successfully pulling off a 'pandemic games'. Still, the story that Japan—or at least the LDP—wanted to tell, of a newly reborn and 'normal' Japan (re-)entering the world stage remained untold. Instead, the story of the 2020/2021 Tokyo Olympics was more mundane, that of a state doing a decent job of managing Covid and hosting a mega-event against the wishes of many of its inhabitants.\"[281]\n\n\nA number of controversies arose during the Games, most notably the attempted repatriation on 1 August of Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, allegedly for her criticism of the national sports authorities and team management.[282] Refusing to return to Belarus, over fears for her safety,[283] Tsimanouskaya sought assistance from the IOC and traveled to Warsaw, Poland, on 4 August after being granted a humanitarian visa by Tokyo's Polish Embassy.[284]\n\n\nNear the end of the Olympics, it was reported that Australian athletes had damaged the village rooms before departure, leaving a pool of vomit on the floor, damaged beds and a hole in the wall. Australian rugby Olympians also reportedly became drunk on the flight to Sydney, leaving vomit in the plane bathroom and receiving complaints from other passengers. Team Australia chief Ian Chesterman played down the incidents, and said that the Olympians would not be punished.[285]\n\n\nAfter the Olympics concluded, New Zealand diving judge Lisa Wright revealed that during the diving events, Zhou Jihong, Vice President of FINA from China, allegedly launched a verbal tirade at Wright at the conclusion of the men's 10m platform final. Wright alleged that Zhou verbally abused her for underscoring Chinese divers.[286] Diving New Zealand subsequently complained about the incident to FINA's Ethics Panel. As a result, Zhou was ordered by in a FINA Ethics Panel decision[287] to write a letter of apology to Wright. A recommendation was also made by the Ethics Panel to disestablish Zhou's position as Diving Bureau Liaison for FINA. The FINA Ethics Panel stated that the incident during the men's platform final was \"unfortunate\" and led to a \"misunderstanding mixed with misjudgement\" between Wright and Zhou.[287] In May 2022, former international diver, Olympic judge and previous member of FINA's Technical Diving Committee from New Zealand Simon Latimer revealed he had sent a whistleblower complaint[288] to FINA's Executive Director Brent Nowicki in December 2021 detailing Zhou's alleged \"unethical behavior\" which also contained allegations that Zhou coached Chinese divers during major events during the 2020 Summer Olympics and she had manipulated judging panels in order to benefit Chinese athletes. Latimer claimed that Zhou's behavior was tarnishing the reputation of international diving and that she was acting in the interests of China rather than international diving as a whole. Subsequent to Latimer's complaint, video evidence emerged online showing Zhou coaching Chinese divers during competition sessions at the Olympics,[289] a behavior considered unethical given her supposedly neutral role as a FINA Vice President and Diving Bureau Liaison.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2020 Summer Olympics broadcasters\n\nThe Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 reached a global broadcast audience of 3.05 billion people, according to independent research conducted on behalf of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Official coverage on Olympic broadcast partners' digital platforms alone generated 28 billion video views in total – representing a 139 per cent increase compared with the Olympic Games Rio 2016 and underlining the changing media landscape and Tokyo 2020's designation as the first streaming Games and the most watched Olympic Games ever on digital platforms.[290]\n\n\nSony and Panasonic partnered with NHK to develop broadcasting standards for 8K resolution television, with a goal to release 8K television sets in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics.[291][292] In early 2019, Italian broadcaster RAI announced its intention to deploy 8K broadcasting for the Games.[293] NHK broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies, and coverage of selected events in 8K.[294][295] Telecom company NTT Docomo signed a deal with Finland's Nokia to provide 5G-ready baseband networks in Japan in time for the Games.[296][297]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics were broadcast in the United States by NBCUniversal networks, as part of a US$4.38 billion agreement that began at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.[298] The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee asserted that a \"right of abatement\" clause in the contract was triggered by the delay of the Games to 2021, requiring the IOC to \"negotiate in good faith an equitable reduction in the applicable broadcast rights payments\" by NBC, which remains one of IOC's biggest revenue streams.[224][299] According to NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, the Tokyo games could be the most profitable Olympics in NBC's history. The Tokyo games were NBC's first Olympics broadcast under current president Susan Rosner Rovner.[300]\n\n\nIn Europe, this was the first Summer Olympics under the IOC's exclusive pan-European rights deal with Eurosport, which began at the 2018 Winter Olympics and is contracted to run through 2024. The rights for the 2020 Summer Olympics covered almost all of Europe; a pre-existing deal with a marketer excludes Russia.[301] Eurosport planned to sub-license coverage to free-to-air networks in each territory, and other channels owned by Discovery, Inc. subsidiaries. In the United Kingdom, these were set to be the last Games with rights owned primarily by the BBC, although as a condition of a sub-licensing agreement due to carry into the 2022 and 2024 Games, Eurosport holds exclusive pay television rights.[302][303][304] In France, these were the last Games whose rights are primarily owned by France Télévisions. Eurosport debuted as pay television rightsholder, after Canal+ elected to sell its pay television rights as a cost-saving measure.[305]\n\n\nIn Canada, the 2020 Games were shown on CBC/Radio-Canada platforms, Sportsnet, TSN and TLN.[306][307][308] In Australia, they were aired by Seven Network.[309] In the Indian subcontinent, they were aired by Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN).[310]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2020 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Japan\n\t+ 1964 Summer Olympics – Tokyo\n\t+ 1972 Winter Olympics – Sapporo\n\t+ 1998 Winter Olympics – Nagano\n\t+ 2020 Summer Olympics – Tokyo\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The new emblem, created by Asao Tokolo, was introduced at the closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.[6]\n\n\nOriginally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 on 24 March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled).[7] However, the event retained the *Tokyo 2020* branding for marketing purposes.[8] It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the first and only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators.[c] The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.[10]\n\n\nThe Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice.[d] The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year[12] and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.\n\n\nNew events were introduced in existing sports, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.[13]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 medals. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals.[14][15][16] Burkina Faso, San Marino and Turkmenistan also won their first-ever Olympic medals.[17][18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nThe three candidate cities were Tokyo, Istanbul, and Madrid. The applicant cities of Baku and Doha were not promoted to candidate status. A bid from Rome was withdrawn.[20]\n\n\n\n### Host city selection[edit]\n\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to select the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics on 7 September 2013, at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, using an exhaustive ballot system.[20] None of the candidate cities won more than 50% of the votes in the first round; Madrid and Istanbul were tied for second place, so a runoff vote was held to determine which of the two cities would be eliminated. The final vote was a head-to-head contest between Tokyo and Istanbul. Tokyo was selected by 60 votes to 36, gaining at least the 49 votes required for a majority.[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n2020 Summer Olympics host city election[21]\n| City\n | Team\n | Round 1\n | Runoff\n | Round 2\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tokyo | ![](image) Japan | **42** | —\n | **60** |\n| Istanbul | ![](image) Turkey | 26\n | **49** | 36\n |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | 26\n | 45\n | —\n |\n\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: COVID-19 cases at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics and List of athletes not attending the 2020 Summer Olympics due to COVID-19 concerns\n\nSee also: COVID-19 pandemic in Japan and Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports\n\n![](image)Few pedestrians on the Shibuya Crossing during the state of emergency in the middle of Japan's first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, early 2020\nIn January 2020, concerns were raised about the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on athletes and visitors to the Summer Olympic Games.[22] Tokyo organizers and the International Olympic Committee insisted they were monitoring the spread of the disease to minimize its effects on preparations for the Olympics.[23] The IOC stated that in 2020, their Japanese partners and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \"made it very clear that Japan could not manage a postponement beyond next summer [2021] at the latest\".[24] Unlike the case for Zika virus during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted directly between humans, posing tougher challenges for the organizers to counteract the infectious disease and host a safe and secure event.[22] Also unlike the case for H1N1 \"swine flu\" during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, COVID-19 has a higher fatality rate, and there was no effective vaccine until December 2020.[25] In a February 2020 interview, Conservative London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey argued that London would be able to host the Olympic Games at the former 2012 Olympic venues should the Games need to be moved because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[26] Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike criticized Bailey's comment as inappropriate.[27] In early 2021, officials in the U.S. state of Florida offered to host the delayed Games in their state, while John Coates, the IOC vice president in charge of the Tokyo Olympics, said the Games would open even if the city and other parts of Japan were under a state of emergency because of COVID-19.[28][29]\n\n\nEstimates by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Kyoto University predicted that states of emergency might be required during the Games.[30] The reports published at the Ministry of Health experts' panel also showed new patients increasing to 10,000 if the Games were to allow spectators.[31]\n\n\n\n### Qualifying event cancellation and postponement[edit]\n\n\nConcerns about the pandemic began to affect qualifying events in early 2020. Some that were due to take place in February were moved to alternative locations to address concerns about travelling to the affected areas, particularly China. For example, the women's basketball qualification was played in Belgrade, Serbia, instead of Foshan, China.[32] The Asia & Oceania boxing qualification tournament, which was originally planned to be held from 3–14 February in Wuhan, China (the location of the original outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic), instead took place in Amman, Jordan, at the beginning of March.[33] The third round of the women's football qualification tournament was also affected, as the group matches formerly scheduled to be held in China were moved to Australia.[34] The European boxing qualification began on 14 March 2020 in London, United Kingdom, but was suspended after two days of competition before being rescheduled for April 2021.[35][36] It eventually resumed in June 2021 but was moved to Paris, France,[37] because of renewed concerns over travel to the United Kingdom. Other qualifying events that were due to take place in March to June 2020 began to be postponed until later in the year and mid-2021 as part of a wider suspension of international sporting competitions in response to the pandemic. A multitude of Olympic sports were affected, including archery, baseball, cycling, handball, judo, rowing, sailing, volleyball, and water polo.[38]\n\n\n\n### Effect on doping tests[edit]\n\n\nMandatory doping tests were being severely restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. European anti-doping organizations raised concerns that blood and urine tests could not be performed and that mobilizing the staff necessary to do so before the end of the pandemic would be a health risk. Despite the need for extensive testing to take place in advance of the Games, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) stated that public health and safety were their topmost priorities.[39] The Chinese anti-doping agency temporarily ceased testing on 3 February 2020, with a planned resumption of phased testing towards the end of the month,[40] and the anti-doping organizations in the United States, France, Great Britain, and Germany had reduced their testing activities by the end of March.[39]\n\n\n\n### Postponement to 2021[edit]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (TOCOG) released a statement on 2 March 2020, confirming that preparations for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics were \"continuing as planned\".[41] On 23 March, both Canada and Australia indicated that they would withdraw from the Games if they were not postponed by a year.[42] On the same day, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe stated he would support a proposed postponement, citing that ensuring athlete safety was \"paramount,\" and veteran IOC member and former vice president Dick Pound said that he expected the Games to be postponed.[43][44]\n\n\nOn 24 March 2020, 122 days to go for the planned start, the IOC, TOCOG and prime minister Abe released a joint statement announcing that the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics would be rescheduled to a date \"beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021\". They stated that the Games could \"stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times\", and that the Olympic flame could become \"the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present\".[45] Prime Minister Abe stated that IOC president Thomas Bach responded \"with 100% agreement\" to his proposal to delay the Games. For continuity and marketing purposes, it was agreed that the Games would still be branded as Tokyo 2020 despite the change in schedule.[8]\n\n\nOn 30 March 2020, the IOC and TOCOG announced that they had reached an agreement on the new dates for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which would now begin with the opening ceremony on 23 July 2021 and end with the closing ceremony on 8 August 2021, still to be held in Tokyo.[46][47] The subsequent Winter Olympics in Beijing are scheduled to begin on 4 February 2022, less than six months later. Shortly before the postponement was confirmed, the IOC and Tokyo 2020 organizers formed a task force named \"Here We Go\" with the remit to address any issues arising from postponing the Games, such as sponsorship and accommodation. The organizers confirmed that all athletes who had already qualified for Tokyo 2020 would keep their qualification slots.[48]\n\n\n\n### Calls for cancellation[edit]\n\n\nHealth experts expressed concern in April 2020 that the Games might have to be cancelled if the pandemic should persist.[49] In an interview, the then president of TOCOG and former Japanese prime minister, Yoshirō Mori, asserted that the Games would be \"scrapped\" if they could not go ahead in 2021.[50] On 29 April 2020, Prime Minister Abe stated that the Games \"must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic\".[51] Thomas Bach acknowledged in an interview on 20 May 2020, that the job of reorganizing the Tokyo Games was \"a mammoth task\" and also admitted that the event would have to be cancelled altogether if it could not take place in the summer of 2021.[52] However, both Mori and Bach expressed optimism about the Games going ahead.[50][52]\n\n\nA member of the Japanese COVID-19 Advisory Committee on the basic action policy co-authored a *British Medical Journal* editorial, which stated, \"holding Tokyo 2020 for domestic political and economic purposes—ignoring scientific and moral imperatives—is contradictory to Japan's commitment to global health and human security\".[53]\n\n\nOn 21 January 2021, multiple sources reported that the Japanese government had \"privately concluded\" that the Games would have to be cancelled.[54] The government dismissed the claims, stating that the reports were \"categorically untrue\".[55] The new Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga confirmed on 19 February that the G7 had given unanimous support for the postponed Games to go ahead as scheduled.[56] It was reported in April 2021, just three months before the start of the Games, that there was still the option to cancel the Tokyo Olympics with the country having vaccinated less than 1% of its population, with tens of thousands of volunteers expected to take part and athletes not being required to quarantine after arriving in Japan.[57][58]\n\n\nPublic support for the Games in Japan decreased significantly amid a 2021 surge in COVID-19 cases in the country.[59] Multiple organizations of medical professionals voiced oppositions to the Games,[53][60][61] while an opinion poll in April 2021 saw 40% of participants support the cancellation of the Games, and 33% support a second postponement.[62] In May 2021, 83% of those polled supported the cancellation or postponement of the Games.[63] The Tokyo Medical Practitioners Association called for the cancellation, stating that hospitals in Tokyo \"have their hands full and have almost no spare capacity\" in an open letter to the prime minister.[64] At least nine out of 47 elected governors supported the cancellation of the Games.[65] Nearly 37% of Japanese companies surveyed supported the cancellation of the Games, and 32% supported postponement.[66]\n\n\nKenji Utsunomiya, who had previously run for Governor of Tokyo, collected more than 351,000 signatures on a petition calling for the organisers to \"prioritise life\" over the Olympics.[67] Japanese writers Jiro Akagawa[68][69] and Fuminori Nakamura also called for the Games to be postponed or cancelled.[70]\n\n\nOn 26 May 2021, the *Asahi Shimbun* newspaper, which was a local sponsor of the Games, published an editorial calling for Prime Minister Suga to \"calmly and objectively assess the situation and decide on the cancellation of the event this summer.\"[71] On 4 June it was reported that Japanese sponsors proposed to the organisers for \"the Games to be postponed for several months,\" citing a comment by a corporate sponsor senior executive: \"It just makes much, much more sense from our perspective to hold the Games when there are more vaccinated people, the weather is cooler and maybe public opposition is lower.\"[72]\n\n\nIn July 2021, it was announced that all events in Tokyo were to be held behind closed doors with no spectators due to a new state of emergency. A poll by the *Asahi Shimbun* found that 55% of those surveyed supported the cancellation of the Olympics, and 68% felt that organisers would not be able to suitably control COVID-19 at the Games.[73] The decision was also detrimental to local sponsors, which had planned in-person presences to promote their products during the Games; an executive of official sponsor Toyota stated that the company had pulled a television advertising campaign it had planned for the Games in Japan, citing that the Olympics were \"becoming an event that has not gained the public's understanding.\"[73][74]\n\n\nHad the games been cancelled, it would have been the first time since World War II that an Olympic event had been called off and the first games to be scrapped due to circumstances unrelated to war.[e] A complete cancellation would have also cost Japan ¥4.52 trillion (US$41.5 billion), based on operating expenses and loss of tourism activity due to Japan which had closed its international borders to foreign travellers since March 2020, did not eventually reopen until October 2022, and was initially scheduled to end preventive border measures in May 2023 but had moved early at the end of April of that year, less than two years after the Games ended.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Costs and insurance[edit]\n\n\nAccording to an estimate conducted by professor emeritus Katsuhiro Miyamoto of Kansai University and reported by the NHK in March 2020, the cost of delaying the 2020 Olympics by one year would be 640.8 billion yen (US$5.8 billion), taking maintenance expenditures for the unused facilities into account.[75]\n\n\nThe Nomura Research Institute estimated that cancelling the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2021 would cost around 1.81 trillion yen ($17 billion), less than the economic damages projected if another state of emergency is declared, noting that a decision to hold the games \"should be made based on the impact on infection risks, not from the standpoint of economic loss\".[77]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Games were protected through the commercial insurance marketplace Lloyd's of London, by global reinsurers Munich Re and Swiss Re. The IOC takes out around $800 million of insurance for each Summer Olympics, with the total amount of loss insured for the 2020 Games likely to be more than $2 billion.[*needs update*] The disruption caused by postponing the Games was covered by the insurance policy, with those likely to make claims for their financial losses including local organizers, sponsors, hospitality firms, and travel providers.[78][79][*needs update*]\n\n\nHolders of tickets purchased from overseas prior to postponement were entitled to refunds for both Olympic and Paralympic ticket purchases, except for the costs of cancelled hotel bookings. Although about 600,000 Olympic tickets and 300,000 Paralympic tickets were eligible to be refunded, organizers said that they would not release the total costs of the refunds.[80] Reuters quoted industry sources who estimated that the Tokyo Olympics Committee had taken out US$500–800 million in insurance, and that after accounting for costs such as rebooking sporting venues and the Olympic Village, little of that payout would be available to recoup the proceeds of lost and refunded ticket sales.[81] The local organizers are responsible for ticket sales and use them to defray the costs of holding the games; ticket sales were expected to bring in approximately US$800 million, but actual sales were close to zero.[82]\n\n\nIn June 2022, the Tokyo Organizing Committee revealed in the final budget report for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics that the cost for the Olympic Games was 640.4 billion yen (US$5.8 billion [f]), which was higher than the cost for the Rio 2016.[84][2]\n\n\n\n### Public opinion and COVID-19 effect during and after the Games[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the Tokyo Olympics being held, many Japanese people were negative about hosting the event, but their attitudes had become more positive towards the end of the Games. According to a public opinion poll conducted jointly by the Nippon News Network and the *Yomiuri Shimbun* newspaper, which targeted Japanese citizens at the end of the Olympics, 38% of respondents said that it was possible to hold the Olympics in a safe manner against COVID-19, while 55% said that it was not possible. However, 64% answered that it was good that the Tokyo Games had gone ahead, while 28% answered that they wished the event had not been held. Of the respondents, 61% were glad the event had been held without spectators and only 12% said that spectators should have been allowed.[85]\n\n\nOn 29 July, less than a week into the Games, journalist Masaki Kubota reported his analysis of the Japanese people's perspective on the Olympics, which he believed was greatly influenced by the change in the way the Japanese news media reported on the Games. He pointed out that many Japanese news media had insisted on canceling the Olympics, citing fears that COVID-19 would spread, but once Japanese athletes started winning medals, the media changed their reporting policy and began livening up the Olympics, which had the effect of altering public opinion in Japan.[86]\n\n\nOnce the Tokyo Olympics were underway, followed by the Tokyo Paralympics, there was a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in Japan, especially those caused by the Delta variant. On 26 July, there were 60,157 cases detected in Japan, breaking the record of 44,961 cases recorded on 10 May. On 9 August, one day after the Olympics had ended, daily cases in Japan reached 100,000 for the first time, and new cases continued to increase until the peak on 23 August, when 156,931 cases were recorded.[87]\n\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games\n\n![](image)The Olympic rings on display at Tokyo Bay to promote the Games\nThe Tokyo Organizing Committee was originally headed by former Japanese prime minister Yoshirō Mori,[88] but he resigned in February 2021 due to backlash from sexist comments about women in meetings.[89][90][91] Seiko Hashimoto was chosen to succeed him. Tamayo Marukawa, Minister for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, was responsible for overseeing the preparations on behalf of the Japanese government.[91]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Metropolitan Government set aside a fund of ¥400 billion (more than US$3.67 billion) to cover the cost of hosting the Games. The Japanese government was considering easing airspace restrictions to allow an increased slot capacity at both Haneda and Narita airports. A new railway line was planned to link both airports through an expansion of Tokyo Station, cutting travel time from Tokyo Station to Haneda from 30 minutes to 18 minutes, and from Tokyo Station to Narita from 55 minutes to 36 minutes; funded primarily by private investors, the line would cost ¥400 billion. The East Japan Railway Company (JR East) was also planning a new route near Tamachi to Haneda Airport.[92]\n\n\nThere were plans to fund the accelerated completion of the Central Circular Route, Tokyo Gaikan Expressway, and Ken-Ō Expressway, and the refurbishment of other major expressways in the area.[93] The Yurikamome automated transit line was also to be extended from its existing terminal at Toyosu Station to a new terminal at Kachidoki Station, passing the site of the Olympic Village, although the line was not expected to have adequate capacity to serve major events in the Odaiba area on its own.[94]\n\n\nIn April 2018, the Tokyo Organizing Committee signed a partnership with the International Labour Organization to ensure decent work in the preparation of and during the 2020 Olympic Games.[95]\n\n\nIn June 2020, the chief executive of the Organizing Committee, Toshirō Mutō, stated that the committee was exploring options for streamlining the Games to achieve cost savings.[96] On 25 September, the IOC and Tokyo Organizing Committee agreed to a suite of measures to simplify the Games' logistics, including a cut to non-athlete staff, use of online meetings, and streamlined transport, among others. The committee also outlined areas it would be exploring in order to maintain the health and safety of all participants.[97]\n\n\n\n### Venues and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The newly built Japan National Stadium in Tokyo was the venue for the ceremonies and the athletics events.\nMain article: Venues of the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Tokyo's former National Stadium, the central venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, would undergo a ¥100 billion renovation for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics.[98] In November 2012, the Japan Sport Council announced that it was taking bids for proposed stadium designs. Of the 46 finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid design—which was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrine—and widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and \"optimize\" the design.[99]\n\n\nIn June 2015, the government announced plans to reduce the new stadium's permanent capacity to 65,000 in its athletics configuration (although with the option to add up to 15,000 temporary seats for football) as a further cost-saving measure.[100][101] The original plan to build a retractable roof was also abandoned.[102] At the end of 2015, as a result of public opposition to the increasing costs of the new stadium (which had reached ¥252 billion), the government chose to reject Zaha Hadid's design entirely and selected a new design by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. Inspired by traditional temples and with a lower profile, Kuma's design had a budget of ¥149 billion. The changes meant the new stadium could not be completed in time for the 2019 Rugby World Cup as originally intended.[103] The National Stadium, which was inaugurated on 21 December 2019, was named the Olympic Stadium for the duration of the Tokyo Games.[104]\n\n\nIn October 2018, the Board of Audit issued a report stating that the total cost of the Olympic venues could exceed US$25 billion.[105]\n\n\nOf the 33 competition venues in Tokyo, 28 were within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of the Olympic Village, with eleven new venues to be constructed.[106] On 16 October 2019, the IOC announced that there were plans to re-locate the marathon and racewalking events to Sapporo for heat concerns.[107] The plans were made official on 1 November 2019 after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike accepted the IOC's decision, despite her belief that the events should have remained in Tokyo.[108]\n\n\nIn general, as urban studies scholar Faure notes, \"The Tokyo 2020–2021 Games had a relatively moderate impact on the city, compared to previous cases such as Rio and Sochi, or cases in which a major Olympic park was built in Barcelona in 1992, and in Beijing in 2008. The transport infrastructure has been marginally improved by facilitating access for people with mobility constraints and improving signage in other languages. Haneda Airport has been expanded, and a hydrogen-powered bus rapid transit system has been introduced. Several sports and event facilities were built, including the new Olympic Stadium. Finally, the Olympic Village has been built on the Harumi landfill.\"[109]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Police patrolling and watching from a rooftop near the tennis venue\nIn December 2018, the Japanese government chose to ban drones from flying over venues being used for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. A similar ban was also imposed for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which Japan also hosted.[110] In January 2020, counterterrorism drills began in different parts where the Games would take place, after intelligence data showed that terrorist groups could have carried out an attack seeking worldwide attention.[111] In July 2021, prior to the start of the Games, the Japan Coast Guard conducted counterterrorism drills in the Tokyo Bay. The drill consisted of two inflatable boats trying to stop a suspicious ship from getting to shore.[112]\n\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nApplications for volunteering at the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games were accepted beginning on 26 September 2018. By 18 January 2019, a total of 204,680 applications had been received by the Tokyo Organizing Committee.[113] Interviews to select the requisite number of volunteers began in February 2019, with training scheduled to take place in October 2019.[114] The volunteers at the venues were to be known as \"Field Cast\", and the volunteers in the city were to be known as \"City Cast\". These names were chosen from a shortlist of four from an original 150 pairs of names; the other three shortlisted names were \"Shining Blue\" and \"Shining Blue Tokyo\", \"Games Anchor\" and \"City Anchor\", and \"Games Force\" and \"City Force\". The names were chosen by the people who had applied to be volunteers at the Games.[115]\n\n\nAs of early June 2021, approximately 10,000 out of the 80,000 registered volunteers resigned from the Games. Media attributed the rise in pandemic cases as the reason for massive quitting.[116] More volunteer assignments were expected to be cancelled due to the spectator ban.[117]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Olympic medal\n\n![](image)Due to COVID-19 protocols, the medals were presented to the athletes on a tray and each athlete was asked to put on their own medal, rather than have it placed around their neck by a dignitary.[118]\nIn February 2017, the Tokyo Organizing Committee announced an electronics recycling program in partnership with Japan Environmental Sanitation Center and NTT Docomo, soliciting donations of electronics such as mobile phones to be reclaimed as materials for the medals. Aiming to collect eight tonnes of metals to produce the medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, collection boxes were deployed at public locations and NTT Docomo retail shops in April 2017.[119][120] A design competition for the medals was launched in December of that year.[121]\n\n\nIn May 2018, the organizing committee reported that they had obtained half the required 2,700 kilograms of bronze but were struggling to obtain the required amount of silver; although bronze and silver medals purely utilize their respective materials, IOC requirements mandate that gold medals utilize silver as a base.[122] The collection of bronze was completed in November 2018, with the remainder estimated to have been completed by March 2019.[123]\n\n\nOn 24 July 2019 (one year ahead of the originally scheduled opening ceremony), the designs of the medals were unveiled.[124][125] The medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games were designed by Junichi Kawanishi following a nationwide competition.[126] A new feature shared with the Paralympic medals is that the ribbons contain one, two, or three silicone convex lines to distinguish gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively.[125]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\nThe slogan of the 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay was \"Hope Lights Our Way\".[127][128]\n\n\nAs determined by a 2009 IOC ruling that banned international torch relays for any future Olympic Games,[129] the 2020 Summer Olympics torch was scheduled to only visit the two countries of Greece and the host nation Japan. The first phase of the relay began on 12 March 2020, with the traditional flame lighting ceremony at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The torch then travelled to Athens, where the Greek leg of the relay culminated in a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium on 19 March, during which the torch was transferred to the Japanese contingent.[127] The flame was placed inside a special lantern and transported from Athens International Airport on a chartered flight to Higashimatsushima in Japan. The torch was then expected to begin the second phase of its journey on 20 March, as it traveled for one week around the three most affected areas of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami—Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima—where it would go on display under the heading \"Flame of Recovery\". After leaving Naraha on 26 March, the torch would commence its main relay around Japan, incorporating all 47 prefectural capitals.[128]\n\n\nAfter the decision to postpone the Games was made, the torch was placed again in a special lantern on display in the city of Fukushima for a month. After that, the lantern was transferred to the Tokyo prefecture, where it was kept safe until the restart of the relay in 2021.[130] On 23 July 2020 (one year ahead of the rescheduled opening ceremony), a promotional video was released featuring Japanese swimmer Rikako Ikee carrying the lantern inside Japan National Stadium, drawing comparisons between emergence from the pandemic and her own return to sport after being diagnosed with leukemia.[131] On 20 August 2020, it was announced that the torch relay would begin again in Naraha, Fukushima on 25 March 2021, nearly a year later than originally planned.[130][132]\n\n\nThe final course of the relay was altered due to concerns regarding public health concerns about gatherings along the route (e.g., the Miyakojima leg was canceled), and the relay was held without spectators due to states of emergency in some regions (e.g., Matsuyama, Hiroshima, Hyōgo, and Okayama).[133] The relay ended at Tokyo's National Stadium (Olympic Stadium) on 23 July, with tennis player Naomi Osaka lighting the Olympic cauldron at the finale of the opening ceremony.[134] The cauldron lit in the Olympic Stadium was only used during the Opening and Closing ceremonies: a separate cauldron was lit on the Tokyo waterfront for public view at the Yume No Ohashi Bridge in Odaiba, making it only the second time in olympic history where the cauldron was not displayed in the athletics stadium, the other time being in 2016.[135]\n\n\n\n### Biosecurity protocols[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Temperature check and COVID-19 countermeasures at the tennis venue\nIn February 2021, the IOC began releasing \"playbooks\" containing details on planned COVID-19 biosecurity protocols for athletes, officials, the press, and other staff, including standard protocols such as practicing social distancing, hygiene, the wearing of face masks (outside of training and competition for athletes), and being restricted from visiting bars, restaurants, shops, and other tourist areas around Greater Tokyo Area, or using public transport unless otherwise permitted. Participants would be asked to use Japan's COCOA Exposure Notification app and would be tested at least every four days. Athletes who tested positive would be unable to compete and could be quarantined at a government facility (although leeway would be given in the event of false positives). Close contacts would also need to test negative in order to be cleared for competition. Athletes would be discouraged from \"excessive\" celebrations because the actions could spread infected droplets.[136][137][138] The playbooks were criticized in a paper published by *The New England Journal of Medicine* in May 2021, for lacking \"scientifically rigorous risk assessment\" and failing to \"distinguish the various levels of risk faced by athletes\". The playbook stated that the athletes were required to arrive up to five days prior to the start of the competition and to leave within 48 hours of being eliminated from their sport or the conclusion of the competitions.[139][140]\n\n\nThe IOC recommended the vaccination of athletes against COVID-19 if vaccines were available to them, but this was not a prerequisite for participation and the IOC advised against athletes \"jumping the queue\" in order to obtain priority over essential populations.[141] On 12 March 2021, Thomas Bach announced that in nations where they were approved for use, the Chinese Olympic Committee had offered to cover the costs of the Chinese CoronaVac and the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine for athletes competing in the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics, and would purchase two doses for their nation's general public for each vaccinated athlete.[142] On 6 May 2021, Pfizer announced that it would donate doses of its vaccine to NOCs competing in Tokyo.[143]\n\n\nApproximately 93,000 athletes and officials were exempt from the quarantine rules upon arriving in Japan, provided that they remained in areas separated from the local population. With around 300,000 local staff and volunteers entering and exiting these bubbles, and 20,000 vaccine doses allocated for this group, this led to concerns of COVID-19 spreading both during the Games and when teams returned to their countries.[144][145]\n\n\nDue to international travel restrictions, the organizing committee announced in March 2021 that no international guests (including spectators, and friends and family members of the athletes) would be allowed to attend the Games. As per existing guidance for spectator sports in Japan, spectators would be asked to refrain from cheering or shouting.[138] On 19 June 2021, Governor Koike announced that plans for public viewing events for the Games had been scrapped, in order to use the planned venues (such as Yoyogi Park) as mass vaccination sites instead.[146] On 21 June, it was announced that all venues would be capped at a maximum of 10,000 ticketed spectators or 50% capacity, whichever was lower.[147]\n\n\nOn 2 July 2021, the new TOCOG president Seiko Hashimoto warned that there was still a possibility of the Games being held behind closed doors because of rising COVID-19 cases in the country.[148][149] Japan's slow vaccination rate had been of particular concern.[150][151] A simulation run by the University of Tokyo in May 2021 projected that a new wave of infections could peak in mid-October if the Games went on after the existing state of emergency in Tokyo had expired.[152][153]\n\n\nOn 8 July 2021, after Tokyo had recorded 920 new COVID-19 cases (its highest increase since May), Prime Minister Suga declared a new state of emergency in the Tokyo area from 12 July through 22 August (ending only two days before the Paralympics' opening ceremony), and announced that all events at venues in the area would therefore be held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted. Hashimoto stated that \"it is extremely regrettable that the Games will be staged in a very limited manner in the face of the spread of novel coronavirus infections.\" IOC President Thomas Bach stated that \"we will support any measure which is necessary to have a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games for the Japanese people and all the participants.\"[150][151][154]\n\n\nThe announcement stated that spectators would still be allowed at events being held outside of Tokyo, subject to the approval by local health authorities and the aforementioned 50%/10,000-spectator limit. The prefectures of Fukushima, Hokkaido and Ibaraki announced that they would prohibit spectators at events held in the areas.[155] The opening ceremony was expected to be limited to fewer than 1,000 VIP guests, including IOC representatives and dignitaries,[156] while some events did allow members of other competing delegations to occupy spectator seats as well.[157] School students were invited to watch football matches in Ibaraki.[158][159]\n\n\nOn 16 July, it was reported that Bach had asked Prime Minister Suga about the possibility that restrictions on spectators could be eased later on if COVID-19 conditions were to improve in Tokyo.[156] However, on 2 August, Suga announced that all existing state of emergency declarations would be extended through 31 August, and be extended to Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama, and parts of Osaka.[160]\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nThe opening ceremony tickets were expected to range from ¥12,000 to ¥300,000, with a maximum price of ¥130,000 for the finals of the athletics track and field events.[161] The average ticket price was ¥7,700, with half the tickets being sold for up to ¥8,000. A symbolic ticket price of ¥2,020 was expected for families, groups resident in Japan, and in conjunction with a school program.[161] Tickets would be sold through 40,000 shops in Japan and by mail order to Japanese addresses through the internet.[162] International guests, had they been allowed, would have needed to visit Japan during the sales period, or arrange to buy tickets through a third party such as a travel agent.[163]\n\n\nTickets went on general sale in Japan in the autumn of 2019 and were expected to be sold globally from June 2020; however, this plan was suspended when the Games were postponed on 24 March 2020. The Tokyo Organizing Committee confirmed that tickets already purchased would remain valid for the same sessions according to the new schedule and that refunds were also being offered.[164]\n\n\nOn 20 March 2021, it was announced that due to COVID-19-related concerns, no international guests would be allowed to attend the 2020 Olympics or Paralympics. This included both spectators, as well as the friends and family of athletes. All overseas ticketholders would be refunded.[138] Hashimoto cited uncertainties surrounding international travel restrictions, and goals to preserve the safety of all participants and spectators, and not place a burden on the health care system.[138] It was ultimately announced in July that all local spectators were not allowed to attend any events held in Tokyo, Fukushima and Hokkaido.[150][151][154]\n\n\n\n### Cultural festival[edit]\n\n\nA cultural program known as Nippon Festival was scheduled to coincide with the Olympics and Paralympics, running from April to September 2021 as a series of streaming events held by the Tokyo Organizing Committee and other partners. The events reflected the themes of \"Participation and Interaction\", \"Towards the Realisation of an Inclusive Society\" and \"Reconstruction of the Tohoku Region\". The program was either downsized or reformatted to virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the postponement of the Games.[165] One of these events was a concert held on 18 July, which featured J-rock band Wanima, choreography by dancers Aio Yamada and Tuki Takamura, and the presentation of animated \"creatures\" based on illustrations \"embodying the thoughts and emotions of people from across the world\".[166]\n\n\nThe original plans for Nippon Festival included events such as *Kabuki x Opera* (a concert that would have featured stage actor Ichikawa Ebizō XI, opera singers Anna Pirozzi and Erwin Schrott, and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra), an arts and culture festival focusing on disabilities,[167][168][169][170] and a special two-day exhibition sumo tournament at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan shortly after the Olympics—which would have differed significantly from the traditional bi-monthly *Honbasho* tournaments, and featured special commentary in English and Japanese to help explain to spectators the customs and traditions of professional sumo, which are deeply rooted in the Shinto religion.[171][172]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A scene from the Opening Ceremony at the Olympic Stadium, with drones flying around and creating the official logo of the Games\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n\nThe opening ceremony was held on 23 July 2021 in the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo. It included the traditional Parade of Nations. Emperor Naruhito formally opened the Games, and at the end of the torch relay the Olympic cauldron was lit by Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka.[173]\n\n\nFor the first time in the 2020 Olympic Games, it was decided that one male and one female in each country would take turns holding flags and serve as two of them.[174] \nThis was done by embodying the \"Agenda 2020\" set during President Bach's term.[175][176]\n\n\nFor the first time in the history of the games, a moment of silence was observed in the opening ceremony for the victims of COVID-19, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami and the Munich massacre.[177]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Olympic sports\n\n![](image)Nippon Budokan\n![](image)Ariake Arena\n![](image)Ariake Gymnastics Centre\n![](image)Tokyo Aquatics Centre\n![](image)Yoyogi Gymnasium\n![](image)Saitama Super Arena\n![](image)Ryogoku Kokugikan\n![](image)Enoshima Yacht Harbor, Kanagawa\n![](image)Tsurigasaki Beach, Chiba\nThe event program for the 2020 Summer Olympics was approved by the IOC executive board on 9 June 2017. IOC president Thomas Bach stated that their goal was to give the Games \"youthful\" and \"urban\" appeal, and to increase the number of female participants.[178][179]\n\n\nThe Games featured 339 events in 33 different sports, encompassing a total of 50 disciplines. Karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding made their Olympic debut, while baseball and softball also made a one-off return to the Summer Olympics for the first time since 2008. 15 new events within existing sports were also added, including 3×3 basketball, freestyle BMX, and the return of madison cycling, as well as 9 new mixed events in several sports (table tennis, archery, judo, shooting (3), triathlon, 4 × 400 m relay running and 4 × 100 m medley swimming).[180]\n\n\nIn the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.[180]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2020 Summer Olympic Sports program\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aquatics\n\t+ ![](image) Artistic swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Diving (8)\n\t+ ![](image) Marathon swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Swimming (35)\n\t+ ![](image) Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (5)\n* ![](image) Athletics (48)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* Baseball\n\t+ ![](image) Baseball (1)\n\t+ ![](image) Softball (1)\n* ![](image) Basketball\n\t+ Basketball (2)\n\t+ 3×3 basketball (2)\n | * ![](image) Boxing (13)\n* ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n* ![](image) Cycling\n\t+ BMX freestyle (2)\n\t+ BMX racing (2)\n\t+ Mountain biking (2)\n\t+ Road cycling (4)\n\t+ Track cycling (12)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n* ![](image) Fencing (12)\n* ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n | * ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Golf (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (15)\n* ![](image) Karate\n\t+ Kata (2)\n\t+ Kumite (6)\n* ![](image) Modern pentathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Rowing (14)\n* ![](image) Rugby sevens (2)\n* ![](image) Sailing (10)\n | * ![](image) Shooting (15)\n* ![](image) Skateboarding (4)\n* ![](image) Sport climbing (2)\n* ![](image) Surfing (2)\n* ![](image) Table tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Taekwondo (8)\n* ![](image) Tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (3)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (14)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (12)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (6)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n#### New sports[edit]\n\n\nOn 12 February 2013, with a remit to control the cost of the Games and ensure they are \"relevant to sports fans of all generations\", the IOC Executive Board recommended the removal of one of the 26 sports contested at the 2012 Summer Olympics, leaving a vacancy which the IOC would seek to fill at the 125th IOC Session. The new entrant would join golf and rugby sevens (which would both debut in 2016) as part of the program of 28 \"core\" sports. Five sports were shortlisted for removal, including canoe, field hockey, modern pentathlon, taekwondo, and wrestling. In the final round of voting by the executive board, eight members voted to remove wrestling from the Olympic program. Hockey and taekwondo were both tied in second with three votes each.[181][182][183]\n\n\nThe decision to drop wrestling surprised many media outlets, given that the sport's role in the Olympics dates back to the ancient Olympic Games, and was included in the original program for the modern Games. *The New York Times* felt that the decision was based on the shortage of well-known talent and the absence of women's events in the sport.[184][185][186] Out of the shortlist from the IOC vote, Wrestling was duly added to the shortlist of applicants for inclusion in the 2020 Games, alongside the seven new sports that were put forward for consideration.[184]\n\n\nOn 29 May 2013, it was announced that three of the eight sports under consideration had made the final shortlist: baseball/softball, squash and wrestling.[187] The other five sports were rejected at this point: karate, roller sports, sport climbing, wakeboarding, and wushu.[188] At the 125th IOC Session on 8 September 2013, wrestling was chosen to be included in the Olympic program for 2020 and 2024. Wrestling secured 49 votes, while baseball/softball and squash received 24 votes and 22 votes respectively.[189]\n\n\nWith the adoption of the *Olympic Agenda 2020* in December 2014, the IOC shifted from a \"sport-based\" approach to the Olympic program to an \"event-based\" program—establishing that organizing committees may propose discretionary events to be included in the program to improve local interest.[190][191] As a result of these changes, a shortlist of eight new proposed sports was unveiled on 22 June 2015, consisting of baseball/softball, bowling, karate, roller sports, sport climbing, squash, surfing, and wushu.[192] On 28 September 2015, the Tokyo Organizing Committee submitted their shortlist of five proposed sports to the IOC: baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding.[193] These five new sports were approved on 3 August 2016 by the IOC during the 129th IOC Session in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and were included in the sports program for 2020 only, bringing the total number of sports at the 2020 Olympics to 33.[194][195]\n\n\n\n### Test events[edit]\n\n\nA total of 56 test events were scheduled to take place in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. Two of the events were held in late 2018, but the main test event schedule commenced in June 2019 and was originally due to be completed in May 2020 prior to the start of the Olympics. Several of the events were incorporated into pre-existing championships, but some have been newly created specifically to serve as Olympic test events for the 2020 Summer Games.[196][197]\n\n\nIn February 2019, it was announced that the test events would be branded under the banner \"Ready, Steady, Tokyo\". The Tokyo Organizing Committee is responsible for 22 of the test events, with the remaining events being arranged by national and international sports federations. The first test event was World Sailing's World Cup Series, held at Enoshima in September 2018. The last scheduled event is the Tokyo Challenge Track Meet, which was originally due to take place at the Olympic Stadium on 6 May 2020.[198]\n\n\nAll test events originally scheduled to take place from 12 March 2020 onwards were postponed due to COVID-19, with the test event calendar to be reviewed during the preparations for the rescheduled Games.[g][199]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia has competed under the provisional name \"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\" in every Summer and Winter Games since its debut in 1996 because of the disputed status of its official name. The naming disputes with Greece ended in 2018 with the signing of the Prespa agreement, and the country was officially renamed North Macedonia in February 2019. The new name was immediately recognized by the IOC, although the Olympic Committee of North Macedonia (NMOC) was not officially adopted until February 2020. The NMOC sent a delegation to the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics in January 2020, but the Tokyo Games were North Macedonia's first appearance at the Summer Olympics under its new name.[200]\n\n\nSince competing as Swaziland ten times at the Summer and Winter Olympics, Eswatini made its debut under that name after the renaming of the country by the king in 2018.[201]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with laboratory data that it had provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA planned to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they would be excluded from team sports. The head of WADA's Compliance Review Committee, Jonathan Taylor, stated that the IOC would not be able to use the \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) designation as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes could not be portrayed as representing a specific country.[202][203][204] Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against WADA's decision.[205] After reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 that the penalty placed on Russia be reduced. Instead of a total ban from all sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but the team would not be permitted to use the Russian name, flag, or anthem for a period of two years and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for \"Russia\" to be displayed on the team uniform—although it should be no more visible than the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation—as well as the use of the Russian flag's colors within the uniform's design.[206]\n\n\nOn 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym \"ROC\" after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee although the name of the committee itself in full could not be used to refer to the delegation. The ROC team would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee.[207]\n\n\n\nOn 6 April 2021, North Korea announced that it would not participate in the 2020 Summer Olympics because of COVID-19 concerns.[208] This marked North Korea's first absence from the Summer Olympics since 1988.[209] In September, a month after the games concluded, the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was banned from participation in the 2022 Winter Olympics, after they failed to participate in the Tokyo Olympics. On 21 July 2021, Guinea announced it would not be sending a delegation to the Tokyo Olympics, allegedly due to COVID-19 concerns, though media outlets suggested that financial considerations may have been the real motivating factor.[210] Guinea later reversed the decision and confirmed that it would be participating.[211]\n\n\n\n![](image)Participating nations\n![](image)Country by team size\nThe

of the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nThe 2020 schedule by session was approved by the IOC Executive Board on 18 July 2018, with the exception of swimming, diving, and artistic swimming. A more detailed schedule by event was released on 16 April 2019, still omitting a detailed schedule for the boxing events.[214][215] A detailed boxing schedule was released in late 2019.[216]\n\n\nThe original schedule was from 22 July to 9 August 2020. To postpone the Olympics until 2021, all events were delayed by 364 days (one day less than a full year to preserve the same days of the week), giving a new schedule of 21 July to 8 August 2021.[217]\n\n\n\n*All times and dates use Japan Standard Time (UTC+9)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **OC** | Opening ceremony\n | ● | Event

|\n\n\n### Medal ceremonies[edit]\n\n\nNaoki Satō composed the music for the medal ceremonies. Satō chose not to employ any musical elements distinctive to Japan \"because victory ceremonies are for athletes from around the world\" and he wanted all medalists to \"feel at ease\" when taking their places on the podium, regardless of their nationality.[221]\n\n\nThe bouquets presented to the athletes came from regions affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The individual flowers were selected to represent the prefectures of Miyagi, Fukushima, Iwate, and Tokyo. The sunflowers were grown in Miyagi, planted by families whose children had died during the disaster; the white and purple eustomas and Solomon's seals were provided by a non-profit initiative to boost the local economy in Fukushima; the small bright blue gentians were grown in Iwate; and aspidistras, grown in Tokyo, were chosen to complete the bouquets.[222]\n\n\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\nPer the historical precedent of swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, swimming finals were held in the morning to allow live primetime broadcasts in the Americas. NBC paid substantial fees for rights to the Olympics, so the IOC has allowed NBC to influence event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible. On 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through the 2032 games,[223] with the company being one of the IOC's major sources of revenue.[224] Japanese broadcasters were said to have criticized the decision, as swimming is one of the most popular Olympic events in the country.[225][226]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n![](image)Miraitowa (left), the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics, and Someity (right), the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Paralympics\nThe official emblems for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 25 April 2016; designed by Asao Tokolo, who won a nationwide design contest, it takes the form of a ring in an indigo-colored checkerboard pattern. The design was meant to \"express a refined elegance and sophistication that exemplifies Japan\".[227] The checkered design resembles a pattern called *ichimatsu moyo* that was popular during the Edo period in Japan from 1603 to 1867.[228] The designs replaced a previous emblem which had been scrapped after allegations that it plagiarized the logo of the Théâtre de Liège in Belgium. The Games' bid slogan was *Discover Tomorrow* (Japanese: 未来（あした）をつかもう, romanized: *Ashita o tsukamō*). While *ashita* literally means \"tomorrow\", it is intentionally spelled as *mirai*, \"future\".[229] The official slogan *United by Emotion* was unveiled on 17 February 2020. The slogan was used solely in English.[230]\n\n\nThe official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics was Miraitowa, a figure with blue-checkered *ichimatsu moyo* patterns inspired by the Games' official emblem. Its fictional characteristics include the ability to teleport.[231] Created by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, the mascots were selected from a competition process which took place in late 2017 and early 2018. A total of 2,042 candidate designs were submitted to the Tokyo Organizing Committee, which selected three pairs of unnamed mascot designs to present to Japanese elementary school students for the final decision.[232][233] The results of the selection were announced on 28 February 2018, and the mascots were named on 22 July 2018. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words for \"future\" and \"eternity\",[231] and Someity is named after *someiyoshino*, a type of cherry blossom.[234] Someity's name also refers to the English phrase \"so mighty\".[235] The mascots were expected to help finance the Tokyo Games through merchandizing and licensing deals.[236] For the legacy of the games on 3 January 2022, Ryo Taniguchi created Miraity (the future child of the mascots).[237]\n\n\n\n### Look of the Games[edit]\n\n\nAlongside the main *Emblem blue*, the five other colors used in the branding of the 2020 Games were : \n  *Kurenai red*,   *Ai blue*,   *Sakura pink*,   *Fuji purple*, and   *Matsuba green*. These five traditional colors of Japan were used as sub-colors to create points of difference in the color variations.[238]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nSee also: Belarus 2020 Summer Olympics scandal\n\nSeveral controversial issues occurred during the preparations for the Tokyo Games. There were allegations of bribery in the Japanese Olympic Committee's (JOC) bid and of plagiarism in the initial design for the Games' logo. On 10 December 2018, the French financial crimes office began an investigation of Tsunekazu Takeda, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, concerning a 2013 scheme to obtain votes from African IOC members in support of Tokyo as host for the 2020 Olympics over Istanbul or Madrid.[239][240] In March 2020, a Japanese businessman admitted to giving gifts, including cameras and watches, to IOC officials in order to lobby for their support of Tokyo's bid to host the Olympic Games.[241] The official emblems of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, designed by Kenjirō Sano [ja], were unveiled in July 2015 but were withdrawn and replaced following plagiarism accusations.[242][243] The lawsuit by Olivier Debie, who claimed that his logo design was copied, was later dropped, with the designer citing escalating legal costs.[244]\n\n\nMass logging for construction of the Olympic venues received international criticism. Petitions, containing more than 140,000 signatures in total, were delivered to the Japanese embassies in Switzerland and Germany, expressing concerns over claims of using tropical wood sourced from Shin Yang, a Malaysian company with a record of human rights abuses, illegal logging, and rainforest destruction.[245][246] In February 2018, the Olympics Organizing Committee admitted that 87% of plywood panels used to build the new national stadium was sourced from endangered rainforests.[247]\n\n\nPortions of the Games were scheduled for locations impacted by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The hosting of events in these locations was promoted as a means of furthering recovery in the regions, with the Games sometimes being promoted as the \"Recovery Olympics\".[248][249]\n\n\nHowever, the organization of events in these regions has faced criticism; Fukushima is considered safe by the World Health Organization and the United Nations, although scientific studies on the safety of the area are still disputed.[250] Some Tōhoku residents questioned the decision to use the region as a host site, arguing that preparations for the Games slowed down recovery efforts, and that the region lost workers to projects associated with the Games.[251]\n\n\nIt was widely reported by international media that South Korea had asked the IOC to ban the Japanese Rising Sun Flag from the 2020 Summer Olympics,[252] claiming it to be a symbol of Japan's imperialist past, recalling \"historic scars and pain\" for people of Korea just as the swastika \"reminds Europeans of the nightmare of World War II\".[253][254] Use of the flag in international sporting events such as the Olympic Games is controversial because it was used for waging aggressive war against many countries in Pacific regions, including the Attack on Pearl Harbor.[255] According to the Associated Press, the IOC issued a statement in response to South Korea's request, saying, \"sports stadiums should be free of any political demonstration. When concerns arise at games time we look at them on a case-by-case basis.\"[256] Russian and South Korean officials took issue with a map of the torch relay on the Games' official website, which depicted the disputed Liancourt Rocks (governed by South Korea) and Kuril Islands (governed by Russia since 1945) as part of Japan.[257]\n\n\nIn February 2021, the TOCOG president Yoshirō Mori resigned, after facing both domestic and international criticisms over his sexist remarks.[258][259] The previous conduct of the new president, Seiko Hashimoto, has also drawn criticisms,[260] leading her to comment \"I regret it and think I should be careful\" on one of the accusations.[261] The head creative director for the opening and closing ceremonies, Hiroshi Sasaki [ja], resigned in March 2021, after making demeaning comments about Naomi Watanabe.[262][263] Sasaki's replacement, Kentarō Kobayashi, was dismissed by the Organizing Committee the day before the opening ceremony,[264][265] after it was reported by Japanese media that he had made a joke about the Holocaust in a script for his comedy in 1998, saying \"Let's play Holocaust.\"[266] On the eve of the opening ceremony, Yoshihide Suga, the Prime Minister of Japan and the Supreme Advisor of the Organizing Committee,[267] described Kobayashi's jokes as \"outrageous and unacceptable\", but also said that the opening ceremony, which was directed by Kobayashi, should proceed as planned.[268]\n\n\nThe composer for the opening ceremony, Keigo Oyamada, resigned days before the ceremony after growing criticism of his past bullying of people with apparent disabilities, such as Down syndrome.[269][270] On 16 July, a week before the opening ceremony, TOCOG announced their support of Oyamada as a composer and vowed not to change his selection for the ceremonies,[271][272] but growing criticism forced him to announce his resignation on 19 July.[273][274] The opening ceremony music included arrangements of video game soundtracks originating in Japan; however, this included music from the *Dragon Quest* series, composed by Koichi Sugiyama whom *The Daily Beast* described as \"notoriously homophobic and ultranationalist\", leading to further criticism of the Organizing Committee.[275]\n\n\nOfficials reported that by early June 2021, about 10,000 of the 80,000 registered volunteers had quit.[276] \"There's no doubt that one of the reasons is concern over coronavirus infections,\" the chief executive of the Organizing Committee said,[277] also stating he did not believe this would impact the operation of the Games.[276] On 23 July, hundreds of anti-Olympic protestors gathered outside the Japan National Stadium before the opening ceremony. Security guards blocked reporters from leaving the stadium to interview protestors.[278] In total, more than 60,000 police were mobilized for security during the Games, and police were regularly deployed to break up public displays of protest, including tackling protestors on their way to join the anti-Olympic protest in Sendagaya during the closing ceremony on September 5, 2021. This overwhelming police presence, including plainclothes police officers who encircled the protest area, \"served as an effective tool to criminalize a peaceful rally and to maintain a frightening image of open protest.\"[279]\n\n\nWriting for *The Conversation*, Olympic scholar MacIntosh Ross raised concerns about the relationship between the IOC and WHO, suggesting the organizations showed a lack of concern for the health of Japanese citizens and Olympians. As Ross explained, \"when the IOC and WHO support a global mega-event held during a pandemic, it's difficult to believe that the well-being of the host nation remains a priority.\"[280] Similarly, Japan scholars O'Shea and Maslow remark, \"International media coverage and commentary runs the gamut from sometimes scathing critique for attempting to pull off a 'pandemic games', to praise and plaudits for successfully pulling off a 'pandemic games'. Still, the story that Japan—or at least the LDP—wanted to tell, of a newly reborn and 'normal' Japan (re-)entering the world stage remained untold. Instead, the story of the 2020/2021 Tokyo Olympics was more mundane, that of a state doing a decent job of managing Covid and hosting a mega-event against the wishes of many of its inhabitants.\"[281]\n\n\nA number of controversies arose during the Games, most notably the attempted repatriation on 1 August of Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, allegedly for her criticism of the national sports authorities and team management.[282] Refusing to return to Belarus, over fears for her safety,[283] Tsimanouskaya sought assistance from the IOC and traveled to Warsaw, Poland, on 4 August after being granted a humanitarian visa by Tokyo's Polish Embassy.[284]\n\n\nNear the end of the Olympics, it was reported that Australian athletes had damaged the village rooms before departure, leaving a pool of vomit on the floor, damaged beds and a hole in the wall. Australian rugby Olympians also reportedly became drunk on the flight to Sydney, leaving vomit in the plane bathroom and receiving complaints from other passengers. Team Australia chief Ian Chesterman played down the incidents, and said that the Olympians would not be punished.[285]\n\n\nAfter the Olympics concluded, New Zealand diving judge Lisa Wright revealed that during the diving events, Zhou Jihong, Vice President of FINA from China, allegedly launched a verbal tirade at Wright at the conclusion of the men's 10m platform final. Wright alleged that Zhou verbally abused her for underscoring Chinese divers.[286] Diving New Zealand subsequently complained about the incident to FINA's Ethics Panel. As a result, Zhou was ordered by in a FINA Ethics Panel decision[287] to write a letter of apology to Wright. A recommendation was also made by the Ethics Panel to disestablish Zhou's position as Diving Bureau Liaison for FINA. The FINA Ethics Panel stated that the incident during the men's platform final was \"unfortunate\" and led to a \"misunderstanding mixed with misjudgement\" between Wright and Zhou.[287] In May 2022, former international diver, Olympic judge and previous member of FINA's Technical Diving Committee from New Zealand Simon Latimer revealed he had sent a whistleblower complaint[288] to FINA's Executive Director Brent Nowicki in December 2021 detailing Zhou's alleged \"unethical behavior\" which also contained allegations that Zhou coached Chinese divers during major events during the 2020 Summer Olympics and she had manipulated judging panels in order to benefit Chinese athletes. Latimer claimed that Zhou's behavior was tarnishing the reputation of international diving and that she was acting in the interests of China rather than international diving as a whole. Subsequent to Latimer's complaint, video evidence emerged online showing Zhou coaching Chinese divers during competition sessions at the Olympics,[289] a behavior considered unethical given her supposedly neutral role as a FINA Vice President and Diving Bureau Liaison.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2020 Summer Olympics broadcasters\n\nThe Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 reached a global broadcast audience of 3.05 billion people, according to independent research conducted on behalf of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Official coverage on Olympic broadcast partners' digital platforms alone generated 28 billion video views in total – representing a 139 per cent increase compared with the Olympic Games Rio 2016 and underlining the changing media landscape and Tokyo 2020's designation as the first streaming Games and the most watched Olympic Games ever on digital platforms.[290]\n\n\nSony and Panasonic partnered with NHK to develop broadcasting standards for 8K resolution television, with a goal to release 8K television sets in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics.[291][292] In early 2019, Italian broadcaster RAI announced its intention to deploy 8K broadcasting for the Games.[293] NHK broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies, and coverage of selected events in 8K.[294][295] Telecom company NTT Docomo signed a deal with Finland's Nokia to provide 5G-ready baseband networks in Japan in time for the Games.[296][297]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics were broadcast in the United States by NBCUniversal networks, as part of a US$4.38 billion agreement that began at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.[298] The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee asserted that a \"right of abatement\" clause in the contract was triggered by the delay of the Games to 2021, requiring the IOC to \"negotiate in good faith an equitable reduction in the applicable broadcast rights payments\" by NBC, which remains one of IOC's biggest revenue streams.[224][299] According to NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, the Tokyo games could be the most profitable Olympics in NBC's history. The Tokyo games were NBC's first Olympics broadcast under current president Susan Rosner Rovner.[300]\n\n\nIn Europe, this was the first Summer Olympics under the IOC's exclusive pan-European rights deal with Eurosport, which began at the 2018 Winter Olympics and is contracted to run through 2024. The rights for the 2020 Summer Olympics covered almost all of Europe; a pre-existing deal with a marketer excludes Russia.[301] Eurosport planned to sub-license coverage to free-to-air networks in each territory, and other channels owned by Discovery, Inc. subsidiaries. In the United Kingdom, these were set to be the last Games with rights owned primarily by the BBC, although as a condition of a sub-licensing agreement due to carry into the 2022 and 2024 Games, Eurosport holds exclusive pay television rights.[302][303][304] In France, these were the last Games whose rights are primarily owned by France Télévisions. Eurosport debuted as pay television rightsholder, after Canal+ elected to sell its pay television rights as a cost-saving measure.[305]\n\n\nIn Canada, the 2020 Games were shown on CBC/Radio-Canada platforms, Sportsnet, TSN and TLN.[306][307][308] In Australia, they were aired by Seven Network.[309] In the Indian subcontinent, they were aired by Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN).[310]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2020 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Japan\n\t+ 1964 Summer Olympics – Tokyo\n\t+ 1972 Winter Olympics – Sapporo\n\t+ 1998 Winter Olympics – Nagano\n\t+ 2020 Summer Olympics – Tokyo\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The new emblem, created by Asao Tokolo, was introduced at the closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
