The elevation of a stream, river, reservoir, or lake will vary seasonally. The bottom of an endorheic basin may fill with water.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The mean elevation of an area is the arithmetic average of all point elevations in the area.\n4. **^** The median elevation of an area is the median of all point elevations in the area.\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The elevation range of an area is the maximum elevation minus the minimum elevation.\n6. **^** Coordinates are adjusted to the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS\u00a084).\n7. **^** Alaska has the highest point in North America and the greatest elevation range of any U.S. state.\n8. **^** The summit of Denali is the highest point in the United States and all of North America. Denali is both the third most topographically prominent summit and the third most topographically isolated summit on Earth. Denali is the highest point in the entire Arctic Ocean Basin.\n9. **^** Mount Magazine is the highest summit of the Ozarks.\n10. **^** California has the lowest point in North America.

Mount Whitney is the highest point of both the San Joaquin Basin and the Great Basin.\n12. **^** The Badwater Basin, an endorheic basin in Death Valley, is the lowest point in the United States and all of North America. The Salton Sea, an endorheic basin with the lowest water level in North America, is currently near the \u2212239.6-foot (\u221273.0\u00a0m) level.[13]\n13. **^** Colorado has the highest mean elevation and the highest low point of any U.S. state.\n14. **^** Mount Elbert is the highest summit of the Rocky Mountains of the United States and Canada.
