In 2020, Kamala Harris became the first female senator, current or past, to win her vice presidential election bid and become the first female President of the United States Senate in American history.\n\n\n\n## Election, selection, and family[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2001, a plurality of women joined the U.S. Senate through appointment following the death or resignation of a husband or father who previously held the seat. An example is Muriel Humphrey (D-MN), the widow of former senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey; she was appointed to fill his seat until a special election was held (in which she did not run). However, with the election of three women in 2000, the balance shifted; more women have now entered service as a senator by winning elections than by being appointed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first time two female senators from the same state served concurrently was beginning in 1993; Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-CA) were both elected in 1992, with Feinstein taking office that same year (as the result of a special election) and Boxer taking office in 1993; Boxer served until 2016, when she retired, and Feinstein was joined by Kamala Harris. In June 1993, Kay Bailey Hutchison won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female Republican senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive \"boys' club\". Since 1992, there has been at least one new woman elected to the Senate every two years, with the exception of 2004 (Lisa Murkowski was elected for the first time in 2004, but had been appointed to the seat since 2002). \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nClinton joined the Senate in 2001, becoming the first female senator from New York, and served until 2009, when she resigned to become the 67th United States Secretary of State, under President Barack Obama. She was replaced by Kirsten Gillibrand, who has been elected three times and was herself a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.\n\n\nIn 2008, Kay Hagan became the first woman to unseat a female incumbent, Elizabeth Dole. Upon the opening of the 112th United States Congress in 2011, New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen was joined by newly elected Republican Kelly Ayotte, making up the first Senate delegation of two women belonging to different parties.\n\n\nIn November 2022, Dianne Feinstein became the longest-serving female senator in history,[8] surpassing Barbara Mikulski,[9][10] having served for 30 years.[11] Feinstein was retiring at the end of her last term, scheduled for January 3, 2025,[12] but died on September 29, 2023, before her term ended.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn December 9, 2022, Sinema defected from the Democratic Party to become a registered independent, leaving 15 of her fellow women senators from her former party, and on January 3, 2023, Katie Britt, the first Republican woman senator from Alabama and also the first woman ever elected to the Senate from her state, began her term as well, increasing the number to 25 again. The death of Dianne Feinstein on September 29, 2023, brought the number back down to 24. The seating of Feinstein's replacement, appointed senator Laphonza Butler, on October 3 returned the figure to 25.\n\n\nAs of January 2023, four states (Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Washington) are represented by two female U.S. senators. Eleven incumbent women in the Senate are former U.S. representatives: Senators Stabenow, Cantwell, Gillibrand, Baldwin, Hirono, Moore Capito, Duckworth, Sinema, Rosen, Blackburn, and Lummis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSixty women have served in the United States Senate since its establishment in 1789.[17] Cumulatively, 36 female U.S. senators have been Democrats, while 23 have been Republicans and one is an independent. As of 2023, no female U.S. senator has ever won election to the House after her Senate term, resigned from a state governorship for the purpose of a Senate appointment by her successor, also won election as an independent or to represent more than one state in non-consecutive elections, served both seats of a state at different times, or represented a third party in her career. In December 2022, Senator Kyrsten Sinema became the first female senator to switch her party affiliation while in office. In September 2023, Senator Dianne Feinstein became the first female senator to die in office.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rebecca Latimer Felton (D-Georgia), the first female member of the United States Senate, who served for a single day in 1922.\n![](image)One woman (Barbara Mikulski) was reelected and four women were elected to the Senate in 1992, the \"Year of the Woman,\" Left to right: Senators Murray, Moseley Braun, Mikulski, Feinstein, and Boxer.\n![](image)By the 111th United States Congress (2009–2011), the number of women senators had increased to 17, including 4 Republicans and 13 Democrats\nFor its first 130 years in existence, the Senate's membership was entirely male. Until 1920, few women ran for the Senate. Until the 1990s, very few were elected. This paucity of women was due to many factors, including the lack of women's suffrage in many states until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, women's limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women's advancement such as sex discrimination.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHistory of female representation in the US Senate\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on the |\n| United States Senate |\n| ![Great Seal of the United States Senate](image)Great Seal of the United States Senate |\n| History of the United States Senate |\n| \nMembers |\n| * Current members + (by seniority\n\t+ by class)\n* Former members\n* Hill committees + (DSCC\n\t+ NRSC)\n* Women in the Senate\n\n\n\n---\n\n* United States Vice President (list)\n* President pro tempore (list)\n* Presiding officer\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| State\n | Current\n | Previous\n | Total\n | First woman senator\n | Years represented by female senators\n | Year first *elected* a female senator\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alabama | 1 | 2 | 3 | Dixie Graves | 1937–1938, 1978, 2023–present | 2022 |\n| Alaska | 1 | 0 | 1 | Lisa Murkowski | 2002–present | 2004 |\n| Arizona | 1 | 1 | 2 | Kyrsten Sinema & Martha McSally | 2019–present | 2018 |\n| Arkansas | 0 | 2 | 2 | Hattie Caraway | 1931–1945, 1999–2011 | 1932 |\n| California | 1 | 3 | 4 | Dianne Feinstein | 1992–2023, 2023–present | 1992 (special) |\n| Colorado | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| Connecticut | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| Delaware | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| Florida | 0 | 1 | 1 | Paula Hawkins | 1981–1987 | 1980 |\n| Georgia | 0 | 2 | 2 | Rebecca Felton | 1922, 2020–2021 | N / A; both women senators appointed\n |\n| Hawaii | 1 | 0 | 1 | Mazie Hirono | 2013–present | 2012 |\n| Idaho | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| Illinois | 1 | 1 | 2 | Carol Moseley-Braun | 1993–1999, 2017–present | 1992 |\n| Indiana | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, Joni Ernst was elected as the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate. In 2016, Catherine Cortez Masto was elected as the first Latina senator, while Tammy Duckworth was elected as the first female double amputee in the Senate.[14] In a June 2016 primary election, as a result of California's recent establishment of the top-two primary, Attorney General of California Kamala Harris and U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez became the first women of the same party to advance to a Senate general election. In November 2016, Harris became the first woman to defeat a woman of the same party in a Senate general election. \n\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first former female senator to win a major party's nomination for President of the United States. Despite winning a plurality of the popular vote, she ultimately lost her bid to Donald Trump.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis article covers the history of **women in the United States Senate** and various milestones achieved by female senators. It includes a list of all women who have served in the Senate, a list of current female senators, and a list of states represented by women in the Senate. The first female U.S. senator, Rebecca Latimer Felton, represented Georgia for a single day in 1922, and the first woman elected to the Senate, Hattie Caraway, was elected from Arkansas in 1932. Sixty women have served in the upper house of the United States Congress since its establishment in 1789. As of October 3, 2023, there are 25 women (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 1 Independent) serving as U.S. senators.\n\n\nNancy Kassebaum is currently the oldest living former female member of the Senate at the age 91.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMartha McSally lost an election to finish John McCain's unexpired term on November 3, 2020, and left the Congress on December 2, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. On January 3, 2021, Cynthia Lummis, the first woman senator from Wyoming, began her term, so the number of female senators reached 26 once again. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris was elected Vice President of the United States; she resigned her Senate seat on January 18 in anticipation of the scheduled commencement of her term as Vice President (and thus President of the Senate) on January 20, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. In addition, Loeffler lost the January 5 special election runoff for the remainder of the term to which she had been appointed, and she left office also on January 20, which further reduced the number of women serving in the Senate to 24. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first woman to serve in the U.S. Senate was Rebecca Latimer Felton; she represented Georgia for one day in 1922. Ten years later, Hattie Caraway became the first woman to win election to the Senate, representing Arkansas. In 1949, Margaret Chase Smith began her service in the Senate; she was the first woman to serve in both the House and Senate. Her 1960 reelection bid resulted in Chase Smith winning the nation's first-ever United States Senate election with two female major party nominees. In 1972, Elaine Edwards was appointed as the first Catholic woman in the Senate by her husband, the Governor of Louisiana, while she was Louisiana's First Lady; she retired after three months. In 1978, Muriel Humphrey Brown became the first and only Second Lady to serve in the United States Senate, after Hubert Humphrey's unexpected death in office. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2012, a record five new female senators were elected. This beat the record of four new female senators from 1992 and set the record of five new women and eleven female senators in one Senate class. The five new women were Democrats Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Republican Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Hirono was the first Asian-American woman and first Buddhist in the Senate, and Baldwin was the first openly gay person in the Senate.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStarting in 2017, United States Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, have held the distinction of being the first and second women elected as both the governor of a state and a United States senator from a state; both served as Governor of New Hampshire before their time in the Senate.\n\n\nIn 2018, Kyrsten Sinema defeated Martha McSally, becoming Arizona's first female senator, as well as the first openly bisexual senator from any state. Two weeks later, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey announced that he would appoint McSally to Arizona's other Senate seat, which was becoming vacant with the resignation of Jon Kyl. Sinema and McSally have been the only concurrently serving female senators to have previously faced off against each other in a Senate election. McSally exited the Senate in late 2020 after losing that year's special election to Mark Kelly, a Democrat.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** Ostermeier, Eric (July 27, 2017). \"Jacky Rosen's Historic 2018 US Senate Bid\". *Smart Politics*.

This paucity of women was due to many factors, including the lack of women's suffrage in many states until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, women's limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women's advancement such as sex discrimination.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHistory of female representation in the US Senate\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on the |\n| United States Senate |\n| ![Great Seal of the United States Senate](image)Great Seal of the United States Senate |\n| History of the United States Senate |\n| \nMembers |\n| * Current members + (by seniority\n\t+ by class)\n* Former members\n* Hill committees + (DSCC\n\t+ NRSC)\n* Women in the Senate\n\n\n\n---\n\n* United States Vice President (list)\n* President pro tempore (list)\n* Presiding officer\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| State\n | Current\n | Previous\n | Total\n | First woman senator\n | Years represented by female senators\n | Year first *elected* a female senator\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alabama | 1 | 2 | 3 | Dixie Graves | 1937–1938, 1978, 2023–present | 2022 |\n| Alaska | 1 | 0 | 1 | Lisa Murkowski | 2002–present | 2004 |\n| Arizona | 1 | 1 | 2 | Kyrsten Sinema & Martha McSally | 2019–present | 2018 |\n| Arkansas | 0 | 2 | 2 | Hattie Caraway | 1931–1945, 1999–2011 | 1932 |\n| California | 1 | 3 | 4 | Dianne Feinstein | 1992–2023, 2023–present | 1992 (special) |\n| Colorado | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| Connecticut | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| Delaware | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| Florida | 0 | 1 | 1 | Paula Hawkins | 1981–1987 | 1980 |\n| Georgia | 0 | 2 | 2 | Rebecca Felton | 1922, 2020–2021 | N / A; both women senators appointed\n |\n| Hawaii | 1 | 0 | 1 | Mazie Hirono | 2013–present | 2012 |\n| Idaho | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| Illinois | 1 | 1 | 2 | Carol Moseley-Braun | 1993–1999, 2017–present | 1992 |\n| Indiana | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, Joni Ernst was elected as the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate. In 2016, Catherine Cortez Masto was elected as the first Latina senator, while Tammy Duckworth was elected as the first female double amputee in the Senate.[14] In a June 2016 primary election, as a result of California's recent establishment of the top-two primary, Attorney General of California Kamala Harris and U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez became the first women of the same party to advance to a Senate general election. In November 2016, Harris became the first woman to defeat a woman of the same party in a Senate general election. \n\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first former female senator to win a major party's nomination for President of the United States. Despite winning a plurality of the popular vote, she ultimately lost her bid to Donald Trump.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis article covers the history of **women in the United States Senate** and various milestones achieved by female senators. It includes a list of all women who have served in the Senate, a list of current female senators, and a list of states represented by women in the Senate. The first female U.S. senator, Rebecca Latimer Felton, represented Georgia for a single day in 1922, and the first woman elected to the Senate, Hattie Caraway, was elected from Arkansas in 1932. Sixty women have served in the upper house of the United States Congress since its establishment in 1789. As of October 3, 2023, there are 25 women (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 1 Independent) serving as U.S. senators.\n\n\nNancy Kassebaum is currently the oldest living former female member of the Senate at the age 91.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMartha McSally lost an election to finish John McCain's unexpired term on November 3, 2020, and left the Congress on December 2, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. On January 3, 2021, Cynthia Lummis, the first woman senator from Wyoming, began her term, so the number of female senators reached 26 once again. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris was elected Vice President of the United States; she resigned her Senate seat on January 18 in anticipation of the scheduled commencement of her term as Vice President (and thus President of the Senate) on January 20, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. In addition, Loeffler lost the January 5 special election runoff for the remainder of the term to which she had been appointed, and she left office also on January 20, which further reduced the number of women serving in the Senate to 24. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first woman to serve in the U.S. Senate was Rebecca Latimer Felton; she represented Georgia for one day in 1922. Ten years later, Hattie Caraway became the first woman to win election to the Senate, representing Arkansas. In 1949, Margaret Chase Smith began her service in the Senate; she was the first woman to serve in both the House and Senate. Her 1960 reelection bid resulted in Chase Smith winning the nation's first-ever United States Senate election with two female major party nominees. In 1972, Elaine Edwards was appointed as the first Catholic woman in the Senate by her husband, the Governor of Louisiana, while she was Louisiana's First Lady; she retired after three months. In 1978, Muriel Humphrey Brown became the first and only Second Lady to serve in the United States Senate, after Hubert Humphrey's unexpected death in office. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2012, a record five new female senators were elected. This beat the record of four new female senators from 1992 and set the record of five new women and eleven female senators in one Senate class. The five new women were Democrats Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Republican Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Hirono was the first Asian-American woman and first Buddhist in the Senate, and Baldwin was the first openly gay person in the Senate.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStarting in 2017, United States Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, have held the distinction of being the first and second women elected as both the governor of a state and a United States senator from a state; both served as Governor of New Hampshire before their time in the Senate.\n\n\nIn 2018, Kyrsten Sinema defeated Martha McSally, becoming Arizona's first female senator, as well as the first openly bisexual senator from any state. Two weeks later, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey announced that he would appoint McSally to Arizona's other Senate seat, which was becoming vacant with the resignation of Jon Kyl. Sinema and McSally have been the only concurrently serving female senators to have previously faced off against each other in a Senate election. McSally exited the Senate in late 2020 after losing that year's special election to Mark Kelly, a Democrat.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** Ostermeier, Eric (July 27, 2017). \"Jacky Rosen's Historic 2018 US Senate Bid\". *Smart Politics*.
